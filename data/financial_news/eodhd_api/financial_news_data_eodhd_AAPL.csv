(Nasdaq: XFOR), a leader in the discovery and development of novel CXCR4-targeted small molecule therapeutics to benefit people with rare immune system disorders, today announced that it has agreed to sell an aggregate of 50,925,365 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 50,925,365 shares of common stock, to certain institutional accredited investors in a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. X4 anticipates that gross proceeds from the PIPE will be approximately $55 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The closing of the financing is expected to occur on or about July 6, 2022, subject to customary closing conditions.

In addition, on June 30, 2022, contemporaneous with the execution of the PIPE, X4 entered into an amendment to its loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital Inc. to extend the interest-only period of its loan facility by up to twelve months (into 2024), subject to achieving certain financial and business milestones. This amendment results in a potential reduction of X4’s cash burn by $20 million over the interest-only period.

Pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, at the closing of the PIPE, X4 will issue an aggregate of 50,925,365 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 50,925,365 shares of common stock. The purchase price per share and accompanying warrant is $1.095 (or $1.094 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant). The warrants will have a per share exercise price of $1.095 and may be exercised at any time on or after the closing date and through the fifth anniversary of the closing date. The price per share and accompanying warrant was based in part upon the last reported sale price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If exercised for cash, the warrants would result in additional gross proceeds to X4 of up to approximately $55 million.

X4 expects to use these funds for continued clinical development and commercial readiness of its lead candidate, mavorixafor, and for business development activities, working capital, and general corporate purposes.

The PIPE financing included participation from new investors including co-lead investor New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Acorn Bioventures and Lumira Ventures, as well as existing investors including co-lead investor Bain Capital Life Sciences, OrbiMed, AXA Investment Managers and Hercules Capital, Inc (NYSE: HTGC). Stifel served as sole placement agent for the financing. B. Riley Securities and H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as financial advisors to X4 in the financing.

The securities sold in this financing are being made in a transaction not involving a public offering and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. X4 has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock and the shares of its common stock underlying the pre-funded warrants and accompanying warrants sold in this financing. In connection with the PIPE, the Company has agreed to convene a special meeting of its stockholders no later than 90 days following the closing to seek approval of an increase in the number of its authorized shares of common stock.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

About X4 Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
X4 Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of novel therapies for people with rare diseases of the immune system. The company’s lead candidate is mavorixafor, a first-in-class, small molecule antagonist of chemokine receptor CXCR4 that is being developed as a once-daily oral therapy. Due to mavorixafor’s ability to antagonize CXCR4 and improve the healthy maturation and trafficking of white blood cells, X4 believes that mavorixafor has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit across a wide variety of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) and certain types of cancer. Mavorixafor has already demonstrated clinical potential in a Phase 2 trial in people with WHIM syndrome, a rare PID. Its efficacy and safety continue to be evaluated in a global Phase 3 clinical trial in WHIM (fully enrolled) and in two Phase 1b clinical trials – one, as monotherapy in people with chronic neutropenia, including Severe Congenital Neutropenia (SCN), and another in combination with ibrutinib in people with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (also fully enrolled). X4 is continuing to leverage its insights into CXCR4 biology at its corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts and at its research facility in Vienna, Austria, to discover and develop additional product candidates.

The company has updated its health benefits policy to include a lifetime maximum reimbursement of $10,000 for travel and lodging for “legal abortions,” according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The change to the 2022 health benefits plan is effective Friday.

After the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, some tech companies, including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., announced benefits such as paying for employees’ travel expenses for abortions. The benefits are aimed at helping workers located in states where abortions are banned or are likely to be restricted. Oracle, which in December 2020 moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Redwood City, California, hasn’t said anything publicly about the ruling.

Oracle also hasn’t made any companywide employee communications related to abortion access in the week since the court’s decision, according to workers who asked not to be named because the information is private. The company circulated an internal email this week about changes in health benefits, including extended parental leave. But the memo didn’t mention the new coverage for abortion travel, according to a manager who described its contents to Bloomberg.

The company didn’t immediately return messages asking for comment on the policy.

Oracle, the second-largest software company by revenue, employed 143,000 people as of the end of May, about one-third of whom are in the US at locations including Seattle, Denver, Orlando, Florida, and the former headquarters in the San Francisco Bay area, according to company filings and its website.

Story continues

While software peers like Salesforce Inc. are reliable supporters of liberal causes, Oracle has long aligned itself with conservative politics. Billionaire co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison has donated to Republicans including former President Donald Trump. Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz advised Trump during his transition after the 2016 presidential election and was viewed as a potential Cabinet appointee.

The abortion issue is particularly relevant in Texas, where Attorney General Ken Paxton has said state law banned abortions in light of the court’s decision. Paxton also said his office is considering penalizing companies that aid their employees in getting abortions.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., another software maker that moved its headquarters to Texas from Silicon Valley in 2020, announced earlier that it would cover costs associated with out-of-state abortion travel for any Texas-based employees.

Some players in the market have raised prices of their phenolic resins products purposefully due to significant increase in the prices of raw materials in global market. They are also introducing new technology of cello bond phenolic resin which is resistance to flames and emits no toxic gases, finding uses in the aerospace interior, tunnel construction and many more.

The inert reaction of phenolic resins with chemicals has attracted the manufacturers of plywood and laminate to increase demand for the market. Additionally, the countries like India, Russia, China and Netherlands have driven the demand of the market due to infrastructural renovation.

The pandemic has impacted the downstream industries due to disrupted supply chain across the globe, additionally, many construction projects were stopped due to guidelines affecting the demand for phenolic resins.

Which Factors are Expected to Drive Demand for Phenolic Resins Over the Coming Years?

“High Demand for Phenolic Resins from Construction Industry”

With the ever-growing construction industry, the market for phenolic resins has been proliferating over the past decades. Moreover, the furniture industry has increased the lucrative use of phenolic resins as an adhesive agent due to their high binding properties.

Novolac is a type of phenolic resin that is reputed as an excellent binding agent and is in high demand in the furniture industry. Novolac resin is a prime choice for plywood manufacturers due to its low resistance to heat, and is easy to be used as an adhesive.

Growing infrastructure in the APAC region has poised an opportunity for producers of phenolic resins. The phenolic market in the APAC region is expected to grow 1.7X over the forecast period, considering the increased use of wood additives, laminates, and molding in the construction industry.

Trends followed by Fact.MR have revealed that the APAC region reached US$ 3.7 billion by the end of 2021 at a CAGR of 4.7%, and has exhibited the highest growth rate across the globe.

Mediated by the Catholic Bishops Conference, the government of President Guillermo Lasso agreed to increase subsidies at the pump. With other measures pledged by the conservative administration, the total is close to $1 billion, said Leonidas Iza, president of indigenous confederation CONAIE.

“We are going to continue our fight, but at this moment, according to the document that we’ve signed, comrades, at the national level we are going to suspend the de-facto measure,” said Iza, referring to road blocks that have strangled transport across large parts of the country.

“We have reached the supreme value we all aspire to: Peace in our country,” said Lasso via Twitter. “Now together we will start on the task of transforming this country in progress, wellbeing, and opportunities for all.”

Social pressures are unlikely to permanently go away, however. Lasso “is going to face very persistent threats of social unrest and demands for spending along with potential renewed efforts to remove him from office,” Risa Grais-Targow, Latin America Director at Eurasia, said. “He is getting squeezed.”

The protests slashed output of crude oil, the former OPEC member’s main export, and hit retail sales. The damage to the economy “evidently will be superior to the $800 million” of a previous indigenous protest in 2019, said Guillermo Avellan, Ecuador’s central bank chief, in an online press conference. “Close to 2.1 million barrels of oil have not been produced.”

Story continues

The bank therefore no longer expects to increase the full-year gross domestic project growth outlook from the previous 2.8% for 2022, he added.

Subsidies, Agreement

The signing of the agreement, which the Church brokered in just hours, was delayed by last-minute demands and haggling over details amid the indigenous organizations, who finally publicly approved it through shows of hands.

“Our democracy is complicated,” said Iza.

The government agreed to extend offers made during the course of the 18-day often violent protests that included attacks on military convoys transporting food, fuel, and medicines, leaving one soldier dead and dozens of police and military wounded. At least two civilian deaths have been reported.

On Thursday, the government pledged to further cut diesel and gasoline prices accounting for close to 97% of demand by another 5 cents per gallon. This reduction comes on top of the 10-cent cut enacted earlier this week, which will increase fuel subsidies by a total of roughly $340 million in 2022 in addition to the $3 billion cost of the subsidy program, the Finance Ministry said.

The government also pledged to lift a state of emergency issued just 24 hours earlier and to cancel an executive decree aimed at increasing oil output. A decree to spur mining development will be changed to add additional environmental protections and to respect archaeological remains.

It will also maintain a public health emergency aimed at improving the distribution of medicines and subsidize fertilizers.

An unspecified list of further demands will be negotiated over coming weeks, with the Church continuing to mediate the talks. To sign the deal, the indigenous organizations had to relent on some items on their 10-point list of demands, including an end to privatizations planned by the administration of the former banker Lasso.

The deal came on the second day after Lasso obtained enough support in Ecuador’s fragmented National Assembly for him to survive an impeachment attempt by a major leftist opposition party.

“It feels like a fragile peace,” said Eurasia’s Grais-Targow.

Bitcoin Plummets Amid Latest Crypto Industry Woes

Crypto investors looking for bad news to justify a continued retreat from bitcoin had more than enough on Thursday.

There were the dual spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) rejections in the U.S. late Wednesday, one of which prompted an immediate lawsuit by Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group. There were the Singapore central bank's reprimand of floundering crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital for misleading it with allegedly false information, a CoinDesk report of bitcoin miners facing margin calls, of crypto futures exchange CoinFLEX continuing to halt withdrawals and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) deeming crypto assets possible threat to traditional financial systems a ""matter of urgency.""

There was even ex-Monero developer Ricardo “Fluffypony” Spagni agreeing to surrender to U.S. Marshals Service for extradition to South Africa.

Already rocked by four days of discouraging economic indicators, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which had held on stubbornly above the $20,000 threshold for much of the past two weeks, fell below $19,000, and was recently down nearly 6% over the past 24 hours. A number of analysts earlier in the week had been expecting bitcoin to break its support even as they admired its resilience.

Story continues

""Negative crypto headlines have been nonstop and fresh concerns that the regulatory environment will be rather harsh going forward has really kept sentiment down,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote.

Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, also plummeted and was recently trading just above $1,000, down almost 7%. Other major altcoins assumed various shades of red, including the tokens from troubled protocols Terra (UST) and Celsius (CEL), which tumbled over 40% and 19% at one point. MATIC and DOGE were both off about 8%.

Cryptos' Thursday drop went steps further than major stock indexes, which closed with modest losses. The tech-focused Nasdaq, whose performance digital assets have tracked in recent months, fell 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each declined by less than a percentage point. The S&P finished the first half of the year with its biggest downturn since 1970, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bitcoin has dropped over 60% this year.

Mark Lurie, the CEO of crypto software provider Shipyard Software, saw a deeper significance in the decline, rooted more in the U.S. central bank's increasing single-mindedness to tame inflation, even at the expense of recession than the Securities and Exchange Commission ETF rejections and other events. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to monetary hawkishness while acknowledging anew the possibility of recession as the money supply tightens.

""Powell signaled the Fed’s resolve yesterday to tame inflation, even at the risk of a recession,"" Lurie wrote to CoinDesk. ""This was already priced into the broader markets, and most institutional crypto investors already expect further downside and a long recession. But retail is often a bit more hopeful and may finally be getting the message.""

However, Lurie remains wary of the Fed's purpose. ""The bigger question on the horizon is whether the Fed will keep its resolve when the costs become clear,"" he wrote.

Speculating on Tokenized Carbon Offsets Won't Help Prevent Climate Change: Consultant

Tokenized carbon offsets were once a favorite of Web2 investors trying to dip their toes into the Web3 world, while also maintaining a certain distance from what critics call the worst parts of blockchain.

Mark Cuban was at one time a big evangelist of Toucan Protocol’s Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) protocol, and spent tens of thousands of dollars bridging carbon offsets onto BCT. Cuban also invested in KlimaDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that wanted to create a lucrative market for carbon by pumping up BCT.

It’s hoped that if there’s a lucrative and liquid market for carbon, with its value being pushed up through speculation, projects that capture carbon could easily get funding because their offsets would be that much more valuable.

“You can’t speculate on carbon offset assets. That’s not how the science works,” Taipei-based carbon consultant Nate Maynard, who also hosts the sustainability science podcast ""Waste Not Why Not,"" told CoinDesk.

Worse, as Maynard highlights, a significant portion of these carbon credits are from projects that are eight to 10 years old. Buying credits from these projects is useless by international carbon accounting norms because the project has been already financed and is in operation.

“If you're buying credits from 2016 for emissions that you're doing in 2021, people are going to look at that, and when you get it reviewed then you have to explain it to your stakeholders why didn't we buy offsets from something that has a more tangible impact,” he said.

In May, Verra, a hybrid standards agency and registry responsible for carbon credits, said it would disconnect the Toucan protocol, which powers BCT, because of BCT's purchases of retired credits for the purpose of speculation. Robin Vix, Verra’s chief legal, policy and markets officer, called what BCT engaged in “mind frying.”

Besides, there are too many other problems in the carbon offset and accounting world that blockchain can’t solve, ironically involving trust.

Carbon offsetting involves all sorts of trust issues to verify the authenticity of the data coming from the project. Outside audits are expensive and out of the reach for many of the projects in the developing world.

Maynard gives an example of an offsets project he’s familiar with in Myanmar at a mangrove. Mangrove trees are well-known carbon sinks; every tree planted can remove hundreds of kilograms of carbon throughout its lifetime. But if this is going to be commodified and traded, it needs to be verified ⁠— and that was going to cost the project close to $1 million, an impossible figure for a budget of its scale. But at the same time, corporations (the usual customers of these offsets) are requiring verification of real carbon mitigation or removal.

“The blockchain doesn't solve this trust issue, maybe in some ways just locks in a lack of trust. Because if something is done and then it's put on the blockchain, everyone goes, ‘well, it's on the blockchain,’” Maynard said.

Because of the issue surrounding trust, the industry is moving to prioritize high-quality offsets and many verified renewable energy certificates effectively cover carbon offsets for many corporations.

As for BCT and KlimaDAO, which derives its value from BCT, they aren’t doing that well, to put it mildly. BCT is trading at around $2, down from a high of $8.60 at the end of last year. KlimaDAO has also suffered a similar fate losing nearly 99% of its value down to $3 from $3700.

Cuban, however, made off handsomely. Analysis of on-chain data by Protos shows that Cuban made almost $2 million in profit from KlimaDAO and BCT tokens, largely through figuring out an arbitrage play between the two.

But what did this do to offset carbon emissions?

AAPL,2022-06-30T23:17:34+00:00,Micron's Earnings Reveal Dismal Outlook for Semiconductor Market,"Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) released earnings results for its third quarter of fiscal 2022 on Thursday after the market closed. Investors have been looking forward to the report because Microns May-ending quarter provides an extra month of data about the semiconductor market, which is experiencing a period of volatility.

We last got an update on the market from Nvidia (NVDA) for its April-ending quarter, which revealed negative effects from the Covid-related factory shutdowns in China as well as the war in Ukraine. In addition to these macro factors, analysts have also been noting signs that semiconductors were overbought in 2021 as companies sought to hoard them amid the fear of shortages.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MU. Click here to check it out.  MU 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of MU Peter Lynch Chart of MU

On the positive side, Micron beat analysts estimates on both its top and bottom lines for the quarter. However, its outlook has investors concerned that near-term pain could be in the cards, not just for Micron but for the semiconductor industry as a whole.

The numbers

Analysts polled by FactSet had called for Micron to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $2.43 on revenue of $8.64 billion for the quarter. Micron surprised to the upside with adjusted earnings per share of $2.59 and revenue of $8.64 billion.

These numbers also compared favorably to earnings per share of just $1.88 and revenue of $7.42 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Operating cash flow was $3.84 billion versus $3.63 billion for the prior quarter and $3.56 billion for the same quarter of fiscal 2021.

The gross margin was 46.7% and the operating margin was 36.4%, both of which marked improvements of approximately 5% compared to a year ago.

Worrying outlook

Despite the positive news for the quarter ending in May, Microns outlook for its next quarter was lower than analysts were expecting. The stock initially dipped in after-hours trading, though it soon recovered to near closing levels.

Story continues

For its fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Micron calls for revenue of $7.2 billion, plus or minus $400 million. Even at the top end of this estimate, it falls far below the $9.05 billion that analysts had been hoping to see, and it would mark a year-over-year decline from the companys revenue of $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $1.63, plus or minus 20 cents. Analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance have an average estimate of $2.62 for adjusted earnings per share, and the figure for the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2021 was $2.39.

Micron noted in its earnings presentation that near the end of the fiscal third quarter, it saw a significant reduction in near-term industry bit demand, mostly from weakness in consumer markets, including PC and smartphone.

President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted weakening demand in the short term, but remained confident in long-term demand:

Recently, the industry demand environment has weakened, and we are taking action to moderate our supply growth in fiscal 2023. We are confident about the long-term secular demand for memory and storage and are well positioned to deliver strong cross-cycle financial performance.

What this means for the industry

Micron is facing double headwinds from the consumer demand side as well as the inventory side, both of which the chipmaker expects to negatively impact its fiscal fourth-quarter results.

This reflects analysts growing worries that, in addition to the war in Ukraine extending supply chain issues that were previously hoped to be resolved with the winding down of Chinas Covid-19 protection policies, the semiconductor industry will also face pain from companies rushing to overstock on fears of shortages, much like a tech industry equivalent of the great toilet paper rush at the beginning of the pandemic. Now that they have excess, demand from customers can be expected to decrease in the coming months.

Another factor to consider is venture capital flows to tech startups are dwindling due to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of recession. Many job seekers in the tech industry are reporting their jobs are being cut either soon after they start or before they even begin work due to funding being pulled. This implies demand reduction from the enterprise side.

Overall, though, Micron seems most concerned about the weakening of consumer purchasing power, as it honed in on this subject in its earnings presentation.

These are unlikely to be issues that are unique to Micron, so investors can likely expect the industry downturn to continue for some months before beginning to recover.

AAPL,2022-06-30T23:00:00+00:00,Natural Gas Prices To Rally As G7 Changes Its Tune On LNG Investment,"Two years ago, the French government asked Engie, the power utility major, not to rush into signing an LNG delivery deal with U.S. energy giant NextDecade, with unnamed sources telling Reuters at the time that the government felt the deal was “not aligned with France’s environmental project and environmental vision.”

Fast forward two years, and Engie is suddenly eager to sign a deal with NextDecade for deliveries of some 1.75 million tons of liquefied natural gas—that same gas that the French government had misgivings about two years ago. And this is only the beginning.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February this year, the European Union has experienced a major priority rearrangement in the energy department that culminated this week with the G7 declaring their support for investments in new LNG production after earlier committing to halting all public spending on such investments, as well as investments in fossil fuels in line with their net-zero plans.

“Investment in this sector is necessary in response to the current crisis,” the leaders of the world’s seven biggest economies said in a statement, as cited by Bloomberg, noting that this is temporary and the projects would need to be aligned with climate objectives to gain their support.

However many hedges the G7 include, this is still a U-turn of the sharper variety. Just months ago, at the COP26 gathering, the G7 leaders and their fellow leaders in Europe were racing to make the most ambitious climate commitment. Now, the race is on to secure enough oil and gas to last the winter.

It is easier said than done, however, because new LNG capacity—not to mention new gas exploration before production—takes time to build. Take Germany, for example. The European Union’s largest economy suddenly developed a taste for liquefied natural gas after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and started talking about building import terminals.

To date, construction has yet to start despite the sense of urgency the German government has been demonstrating since March. As a result, plans to have at least two operating LNG import terminals by the end of the year might not materialize because the final investment decisions on them have yet to be made, according to the country’s gas industry association.

Meanwhile, however, Germany is discussing more LNG deliveries, this time not from the United States but from Canada. Canada has yet to build its first LNG export facility after a couple of false starts that ended with cancellations, but Germany is already negotiating future deliveries.

By the way, these future LNG projects are highly doubtful to materialize, too, because environmentalist opposition to new fossil fuel projects is strong in Canada, and especially in British Columbia, where the new hypothetical terminals would need to be.

There is a bigger problem, however. Governments have a way of making the projects they favor happen, especially if the energy supply situation is tight and the projects’ approval is urgent. That leaves the much bigger question of where the gas will come from.

Of course, both Canada and the United States are quite big gas producers, especially the United States. Still, more export/import capacity is being built in anticipation of a substantial increase in demand. Investments in new gas production, meanwhile, have lagged behind the demand curve. And this means that this renewed love for LNG will likely cause a sustained rally in natural gas prices.

The G7 may try and make all the hedges it likes. The truth is that support for investment in new gas supply cannot be “temporary” in the sense of “a few years”. LNG export terminals are facilities that cost billions to build. Their operators seek long-term commitments to motivate the investment decision. So does Qatar, which is expanding its own LNG export capacity substantially.

Even though the G7 leaders pretend long-term contracts are not a thing, or that they can pass for “temporary”, they very much are a thing, and that’s some serious compromise on climate goals as is already being detected by the media.

Stock Doomsayers Vindicated in Historic First Half: Markets Wrap The Wheels Have Come Off Electric Vehicles Democrats Weigh Paring Biden Tax Hike to Win Over Manchin Supreme Court Crimps Biden’s Climate Agenda With Limits on EPA US Will Face High Gas Prices ‘as Long as It Takes,’ Biden Says

McConnell made the threat as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is negotiating a scaled-back version of President Joe Biden’s economic plan with West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. That plan includes prescription drug price cuts, tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, and energy and climate provisions.

The China bill, which provides more than $50 billion to subsidize US semiconductor chip manufacturing, has been stalled as the House and Senate try to resolve differences in their approaches.

“Let me be perfectly clear: there will be no bipartisan USICA as long as Democrats are pursuing a partisan reconciliation bill,” McConnell said in his tweet, using an acronym for the proposed legislation.

Democrats reacted angrily to McConnell’s threat.

“Senate Republicans are literally choosing to help China out compete the U.S. in order to protect big drug companies,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that echoed those of Democratic congressional leaders. “This takes loyalty to special interests over working Americans to a new and shocking height. We are not going to back down in the face of this outrageous threat.”

McConnell has the power to block the bipartisan competition bill in the 50-50 Senate using the chamber’s filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation outside the budget process.

Democrats have been striving to pass the economic package, which under special budget rules needs only a simple majority vote, before the scheduled August congressional recess. With their razor-thin majority in peril in the November midterm election, they want to promote the legislation as an inflation-fighting measure.

Story continues

So far Senate Democrats are in basic agreement on prescription drug provisions in the package that would cap out of pocket costs for seniors and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, saving the government hundreds of billions of dollars. Some tax provisions are being pared back to make them ore business friendly.

Schumer and Democrats had hoped to have the China competition bill finished by the end of July. The long-stalled legislation was already at risk of collapsing in Congress, with Republicans growing skeptical of the measure as midterm elections near and Democrats focused on other issues, including the gun safety bill that was signed into law.

The bill would provide billions of dollars to boost research and development with an eye toward creating new technologies to help the US stay ahead of a rising China. A key provision of the bill would provide $52 billion in grants and other incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

The House and Senate are negotiating to reconcile their differing versions of the legislation but have hung up on key points, including trade provisions and whether to include tax credits for chipmakers.

To thwart McConnell, Democrats could attempt to shoehorn the chips funding and other parts of the China bill into their budget bill, although they would drive up the cost. But under the budget rules they are using regulatory and foreign policy aspects of the China bill would likely not be allowed in.

The delays in passing the bill could have significant economic consequences. Intel Corp. has warned that the timing and size of its planned new facility in Ohio will depend on whether Congress passes the bill with funding soon.

“A robust U.S. semiconductor industry is critical for our national and economic security,” William Moss, a spokesman for Intel, said in an emailed statement Thursday. “The rest of the world is moving fast and Congress should put aside politics and act now to pass this critical legislation and ensure the U.S. is not left behind.”

Schumer had led the bipartisan push for the competition legislation, working last year with Republican Senator Todd Young to pass the Senate’s version.

A Schumer spokesman, Justin Goodman, accused McConnell of “holding American jobs in key US industries hostage to help China and protect his friends in big pharma.”

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:51:04+00:00,Is St Barbara Limited (ASX:SBM) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,"Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of St Barbara Limited (ASX:SBM) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

See our latest analysis for St Barbara

Step by step through the calculation

As St Barbara operates in the metals and mining sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.8%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%. Relative to the current share price of AU$0.8, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)

= AU$0.03 / (7.1% – 1.8%)

= AU$0.6 dcf

Important assumptions

The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at St Barbara as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.236. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Story continues

Next Steps:

Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:31:20+00:00,Stocks Set for Cautious Asia Open Amid Bond Rally: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia looked set for a cautious start on Friday as concerns about an economic slowdown bolster sovereign bonds.

Futures edged up for Japan and Australia, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts dipped after US shares posted their worst first half since 1970.

Hong Kong’s markets are closed for a holiday marking the 25th anniversary of Chinese rule. President Xi Jinping is expected to give a speech later Friday.

Chinese shares are one of the few bright spots in global markets, following a recent rally that’s taken the CSI 300 Index to the cusp of a bull market. Easing Covid curbs and brighter economic data have contributed to the rebound.

Treasury yields sank Thursday as softer than expected consumer spending and inflation bolstered the view that sharp Federal Reserve rate hikes will spark recession. The 10-year yield briefly fell below 3% before closing just above.

A gauge of the dollar retreated. Crude held losses on economic growth concerns. Bitcoin, emblematic of depressed sentiment, struggled below the closely-watched $20,000 level after its latest swoon.

Investors appear to be increasingly convinced that the global economy is set for a marked slowdown amid tightening monetary settings in much of the world to get high inflation under control.

“If anyone thinks that equities can rally into the back of the year, they are making the assumption that the Fed is going to let go of its entire focus on price stability and step back from that,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said on Bloomberg Television. “We have a very different view. We think things are going to get pretty tough.”

The latest US data showed inflation-adjusted personal spending shrank in May for the first time this year. Gains in the prior four months were revised down.

Traders expect another 75-basis-point Fed rate increase in July. Swaps referencing policy meeting dates price in a peak rate near 3.5% in March 2023 and a drop to about 3% by year-end.

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:29:00+00:00,NCLA’s Supreme Court Opening Brief Defends Ability to Challenge SEC Tribunals in Federal Court,"Washington, D.C., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Civil Liberties Alliance and Latham & Watkins have authored an opening brief on behalf of Michelle Cochran in the much-anticipated Supreme Court case, SEC v. Michelle Cochran, which will determine whether federal district courts have jurisdiction to hear structural constitutional objections to administrative proceedings. Ms. Cochran, a CPA from Dallas, TX, is challenging the constitutionality of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) in-house Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) and requests that her case be heard before a real Article III federal court that is competent to decide the claims at issue.

Ms. Cochran’s specific objection is that ALJs are executive officers insulated from accountability by multiple layers of protection from removal by the President—a regime the Supreme Court has deemed to violate Article II of the Constitution, which vests executive power in the President and charges him with a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” First charged by SEC in 2016, Cochran has already endured one full trial before an unconstitutional ALJ that has since been voided. SEC employees play judge, jury, and prosecutor in agency proceedings, so unsurprisingly, the agency wins the vast majority of the cases it brings in house. SEC’s administrative proceedings can take such a crushing personal, financial, and reputational toll that most targets are forced to settle, even if they protest their innocence profusely.

The general jurisdiction that Congress granted district courts is a vital safeguard for individuals seeking to enforce their constitutional rights against the government. But in this case, SEC has tried to block federal court jurisdiction, insisting that Congress, in passing the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, implicitly blocked its administrative proceedings from any judicial scrutiny until the SEC has decided to conclude them—when it is too late to vindicate Ms. Cochran’s right to avoid undergoing an unconstitutional adjudication. In the SEC’s illogical view, those caught up in the agency’s machinery must endure years of proceedings—superintended by the very official they claim is unconstitutionally unaccountable—before they may set foot inside a federal courthouse. This notion makes no sense—no one should have to undergo an unconstitutional adjudication that is predestined to be set aside once challenged in court afterward.

When Ms. Cochran filed suit in January 2019, five federal courts of appeal had permitted SEC’s backward regime. In December 2021, the Fifth Circuit sitting en bancruled in Ms. Cochran’s favor and correctly rejected SEC’s troubling theory of implicit jurisdiction-stripping, thus creating a circuit split. NCLA and Latham & Watkins argue that the Fifth Circuit’s judgment should be affirmed, and that the Supreme Court’s analysis can begin—and end—with a straightforward reading of the statutory text and structure, which does not say a word about divesting district courts of jurisdiction over structural constitutional challenges to administrative proceedings.

NCLA’s lead counsel on the case, Peggy Little, successfully argued it before the en banc Fifth Circuit. Latham & Watkins partner Greg Garre, a former Solicitor General of the United States, is Counsel of Record at the U.S. Supreme Court. He will present oral argument for Ms. Cochran there later this year.

NCLA and Latham & Watkins released the following statements:

“The Fifth Circuit correctly ruled that neither the text nor the structure of the Exchange Act stripped federal courts of their duty to protect individuals from unconstitutional agency action. The Supreme Court should affirm that landmark decision course-correcting at least six errant circuit courts that flouted Supreme Court precedent.”
— Peggy Little, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“As explained in our brief, the SEC’s implicit jurisdiction-stripping theory has no basis in the statutory text, Supreme Court precedent, or common sense. And it unjustly deprives individuals like Michelle Cochran from access to one of the most important bulwarks against unconstitutional governmental action—federal district courts. The Supreme Court has previously recognized the importance of upholding immediate judicial review in this precise context, and it should do so again here.”
— Gregory G. Garre, Partner, Latham & Watkins

“For far too long, SEC has wielded its flawed theory of implicit jurisdiction-stripping to close federal district courts and force targets like Ms. Cochran to endure unconstitutional administrative proceedings. Time’s up for SEC and its unlawful ALJs. This case will ensure federal courts are available to vindicate constitutional rights.”
— Mark Chenoweth, President and General Counsel, NCLA

BP paid just $4 per ton to more than a dozen Mexican communities under an agreement signed in 2021. The project’s own research showed buyers were willing to pay more than double that for offsets, which are now worth an average of $12 to $16 on the market.

Asked at his morning press conference Thursday if the market needed regulation to ensure better pay for landowners, Lopez Obrador replied “Yes, of course,” and said his administration would also look into BP’s project for paying “too little.”

A day after the investigation was published, government officials met with carbon offset standards bodies and called for a “just distribution of benefits.”

After learning about the pay disparity from Bloomberg’s reporting, community members in Coatitila confronted one of the program’s contractors. Weeks later, they were told that BP would be increasing their pay. Leading Mexican environmental nonprofit Pronatura, which runs the project for BP, said they will use a model where the oil giant takes a cut of market rate and the rest goes to the community, but declined to give specific figures.

BP said in statement Thursday that its intention is to “create conditions that help landowners to generate income through the protection, restoration and sustainable management of forests.” The company said prices had gone up since it signed the contract last year and it is now restructuring its payment mechanism to ensure communities get fair income.

While ESSA is listed on the Nasdaq, it is also considered a reporting issuer under the Securities Act (British Columbia) and is therefore announcing the establishment of the ASDPs in furtherance of the recently published guidance provided by the Canadian Securities Administrators in Staff Notice 55-317.

Under U.S. and Canadian securities laws and the Company's trading policies, insiders of ESSA are subject to limits on their ability to sell shares in the Company.

Up to 808,333 common shares of ESSA may be sold under the ASDPs implemented by the Participants in the aggregate. The ASDPs are designed to allow for an orderly disposition of each of the Participants' shares in ESSA at prevailing market prices over the course of the approximately 12 months that the ASDPs are expected to be in place. Sales of the common shares under the ASDPs will commence on August 17, 2022, which will be after the Company has filed its Form 10-Q with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 in accordance with the recent recommended practices set forth in Staff Notice 55-317. At the time of the establishment of the ASDPs, the Participants were not aware of or in possession of any material non-public information about the Company or any securities of the Company.

Each Participant has provided for clear trading parameters and other instructions in writing to the independent dealers administering the ASDPs, specifying the number of securities to be sold and setting out minimum trade prices, which in all cases materially exceed the current trading price of the Company's common shares, and the dates or frequencies of sales. The ASDPs prohibit the dealer administering the ASDPs from consulting with the Participants regarding any sales under the ASDPs and prohibit the Participants from disclosing to the dealer any information concerning the Company that might influence the execution of the ASDPs.

The ASDPs contain meaningful restrictions on the ability of the Participants to amend, suspend or terminate the ASDPs that have the effect of ensuring that the Participants cannot benefit from material non-public information.

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:20:10+00:00,"When in Doubt, Zoom Out; Bear Markets Are a Goldmine","It’s been a battlefield within the market landscape throughout 2022, with high-growth and tech stocks seemingly walking around with big targets on their backs. Buyers have entirely retreated, and bears have been pushing forward all year. It’s been exhausting, and bears keep reloading.

Day-traders and scalpers undoubtedly welcome the volatility, but the same can’t be said for long-term investors. Long-term investors don’t benefit from the significant intraday price swings that we’ve become familiar with; they desire considerable, consistent gains on a much larger time horizon.

Let the day-traders and scalpers have their fun. In the meantime, we’ve been presented with a fantastic opportunity to add to long-term positions at valuation levels that have not been seen in quite some time.

Let’s face it – it’s never fun to see some of your big-time winners give back gains. However, building up more significant positions in some of the best companies in the world is always exciting.

Below is a five-year chart of the S&P 500. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

As we can see, it sits at levels it hasn’t visited since 2021 Q1.

Furthermore, the S&P 500’s forward earnings multiple currently resides at 17.1X, the lowest we’ve seen since 2020 Q1. The value is also well below its five-year median of 19.9X. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

So, what does this tell us? A stretch of poor price action year-to-date has presented us with a rich buying opportunity not seen in years.

Alphabet

Alphabet GOOGL shares have tumbled in 2022, decreasing nearly 25% in value. The year-to-date chart below illustrates that. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

However, when you extend the time frame, we can see that GOOGL shares are trading at their lowest level since early 2021. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Additionally, valuation levels have come down extensively. GOOGL's current forward earnings multiple of 20.2X is nowhere near 2020 highs of 39.1X and is well below its five-year median value of 27.1X.

Story continues Zacks Investment Research

Nvidia

Nvidia NVDA shares have been sent down the drain in 2022, losing nearly 50% in value. The chart below illustrates the year-to-date price action of NVDA shares. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

However, upon zooming out, we can see that NVDA shares are currently trading at May 2021 levels, an area where the stock had faced previous resistance – perhaps the previous resistance level will turn into a support level. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

In addition, NVDA’s current forward earnings multiple resides at 34.2X, which appears a bit pricey. But, the current value is well below its five-year median of 49.8X and is nowhere near 2021 highs of 93.5X. Zacks Investment Research

Apple

Apple AAPL shares have struggled year-to-date, retracing nearly 23% in value. Below is a year-to-date chart of AAPL shares. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Once again, upon zooming out, the rocky price action is less concerning – Apple shares are still up 300% over the past five years and are currently trading near July 2021 levels. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Apple’s current forward earnings multiple resides at 22.8X, a fraction of its 2020 high of 41.5X and just above its five-year median value of 20.3X. Zacks Investment Research

Dollar Cost Averaging

Let’s face it – it’s impossible to time the market.

Of course, I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “buy low, sell high.” If it was all that simple and investors could consistently and accurately forecast tops and bottoms, the market would be thrown out of balance entirely.

Then, there is the “buy the dip” approach, which is asking for trouble. Many people buy at the “dip,” yet it keeps dipping – that’s never fun. And, what exactly classifies as a “dip”?

One of the best and easiest ways to build a more prominent position for your long-term winners is the simple approach of dollar-cost averaging.

Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy in which investors split up their initial buys in periodic timeframes, reducing the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. It allows you the flexibility to “buy the dip” and add on to those winners whenever they come into uptrends.

It’s a stellar way to limit overall risk and protect investors against violent short-term price swings.

Bottom Line

It’s undoubtedly frustrating to watch your favorite stock give back all of its gains, but in the long-term picture, things don’t look nearly as bad as it seems. It’s vital to remain confident in your investment thesis through the ups and downs.

There was a reason behind that first initial buy, and if that reason hasn’t changed, there’s no need to panic. Instead, it’s highly beneficial for investors to dollar-cost-average into these positions, making the ride back up even sweeter.

When in doubt, just simply zoom out.

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:18:50+00:00,Goldman Sachs Picks 2 ‘Defensive’ Software Stocks With at Least 50% Upside Potential,"We saw something of a rally in the markets last week, but was it just the famous ‘dead cat’ bounce? A look at the charts might suggest that. Since the beginning of April, we seen two short rallies in an otherwise bearish trend – but the second rally was shorter than the first, with a lower peak. Market watchers are starting to wonder if the cat is done bouncing.

So, how can investors ride out this hostile environment?

Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan believes that software stocks, with currently depressed prices and high upside potentials can provide a measure of protection for investors seeking a defensive stance against the larger market downturn.

“While software is late-cycle and investors are rightly wary of relatively unchanged FY forecasts, we revert to our intrinsic analysis as a backstop to the divergence between these companies’ strong business models and current valuations. We maintain our view that profitable growth software can serve as a defensive asset class during challenging economic conditions,” Rangan explained.

Rangan follows up his discussion of ‘defensive’ software stocks with two such picks. As noted, these stocks feature beaten-down share prices but still have plenty of upside potential – in Rangan’s view, better than 50% for the year ahead. Do other analysts agree with Rangan? Let's take a closer look.

GitLab(GTLB)

The first of these ‘Goldman software picks’ is GitLab, an innovator in DevOps platform development. The company offers business customers an open-source platform for devops work, one that promises to increase speed and efficiency as well as maximizing the end-product’s overall return. GitLab’s innovative insight was to allow users and collaborators to contribute to the planning, building, and deployment of the platform through the open-source model. GitLab offers this basic platform for free to customers, who can also subscribe for access to proprietary upgrades and add-ons.

In the 8 years that GitLab has been open for business, the company has seen its product expand to a wide audience. The firm has over 30 million registered users, representing more than 100,000 companies and organizations. From this base, there are more than 2,000 contributors to the open-source code.

Story continues

The company went public in October of last year, and closed its first day’s trading at more than $103 per share. The stock has fallen since then, and is down 48% from that opening. The share value decline has come even as the company’s revenues have shown consistent gains in each of its first three public earnings reports.

In those reports, the top line has risen from $66.8 million to $87.4 million. The most recent, for Q1 of fiscal 2023, was up 75% year-over-year. At the same time, the company’s net loss has moderated, from 44 cents per share one year ago to 18 cents in the current report.

Against this backdrop, Goldman's Rangan lays out an upbeat case for this open-source software firm, writing: ""Taking a deeper look into our revenue growth assumptions, we gained confidence in GTLB’s ability to sustain a strong top-line growth rate (of over 38%+ over the next three years) and potentially reach FCF breakeven faster than initially expected (4Q24 vs consensus estimates of 2Q25).""

""In addition to GTLB offering a best-of-breed platform in a large and under-penetrated $40bn TAM, we see the culmination of the following factors driving growth: 1) a steady, elevated NER (>130%) supported by seat expansion and customers coming off of discounted subscription plans 2) an increasing mix of Ultimate as the preferred pricing tier among new customers, and 3) a wider top-of-funnel as companies get comfortable with a streamlined DevOps platform,"" the analyst added.

This stance led Rangan to upgrade GTLB shares from Neutral to Buy, and his price target of $80 implies a one-year upside potential of ~51%. (To watch Rangan’s track record, click here)

The bullish Goldman view is no outlier here, as the Strong Buy consensus rating on this stock is unanimous and supported by no fewer than 9 positive analyst reviews. The stock is selling for $53.14 and its $68.88 average price target indicates it has room for ~30% growth in the next 12 months. (See GTLB stock forecast on TipRanks)

Atlassian Corporation (TEAM)

The second Goldman software pick we're looking at is Atlassian, a company working in the B2B realm. Atlassian offers workplace streamlining software for enterprise customers; the company’s best-known product, Jira, lets managers and workers contribute together to assign, organize, and track workplace tasks. Atlassian offers a range of other workplace software products for a variety of uses in teamwork and collaboration.

The quality and applicability of Atlassian’s products can be seen by a simple tracking of its revenues over the past couple of years. The company has seen the top line grow consistently, in spite of – or perhaps because of – the COVID pandemic. When lockdown policies were in effect, Atlassian’s software, which helped facilitate remote work, found new demand – and kept its expanded customer base.

In its most recent quarterly report, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, Atlassian showed $740.5 million at the top line. This was up 30% year-over-year, and a company record for quarterly revenue. The company’s net loss in the recent quarter, at 47 cents per share, was in line with the 48 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.

In recent months, Atlassian has been working to transfer its products, along with new and existing customers, to the cloud, a move that will make it a subscription software company on the SaaS model. Atlassian is pushing the move as an improvement in reliability, security, privacy, and compliance for its customer base.

Atlassian’s applicable products and emerging cloud business, in Rangan’s view, offer a path forward for the company – on a trail that is only beginning.

“With ~226,000 customers and $2.6bn in revenue today, the company has only tapped a fraction of the 2.2mn companies with 10+ knowledge workers and $29bn market opportunity (estimated to grow to $176 by 2025). The availability of a free offering of its products is a competitive advantage for TEAM that allows for steady and strong customer adoption trends with better sales/marketing efficiency,” Rangan explained.

This is another stock that gets an upgrade from the Goldman analyst, who bumps it from Neutral to Buy. Rangan’s $300 price target implies an upside of 60% in the coming year. (To watch Rangan’s track record, click here)

All in all, this software firm has picked up 17 recent analyst reviews, including 12 Buys and 5 Holds, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock’s average price target of $342.87 suggests a one-year upside of ~83% from the current share price of $187.40. (See TEAM stock forecast on TipRanks)

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:15:00+00:00,Empower Clinics Provides Update on Management Cease Trade Order,"VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / June 30, 2022 / Empower Clinics Inc. (CSE:CBDT) (Frankfurt:8EC) (OTCQB:EPWCF) (the ""Company"" or ""Empower"") is providing an update with respect to its previously announced management cease trade order (the ""MCTO"") issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) on May 3, 2022.

The MCTO was issued in connection with the delay by the Company in filing its annual financial statements, management's discussion and analysis and related officer certifications for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 (collectively, the ""Required Filings"") before the prescribed deadline of May 2, 2022.

As a consequence of the delay in the audit, the Company announced on May 30, 2022 that its interim financial statements, management's discussion and analysis and related officer certifications for the period ended March 31, 2022 (collectively, the ""Interim Filings""), would not be filed by the required filing deadline of May 30, 2022.

The Company has previously advised that it expected to be in a position to file the Required and Interim Filings on or before June 30, 2022. In consultation with its auditors, the Company has been informed that it would not be in the position to complete the audit by June 30, 2022.

Subsequently the Company received an extension to the MCTO which requires the Required Filings to be filed on or before July 15, 2022. The Company anticipates filing the Interim Filings forthwith upon filing the Required Filings.

The Company is providing this status update in accordance with National Policy 12-203 Management Cease Trade Orders (""NP 12-203""). The Company intends to follow the provisions of the Alternative Information Guidelines set out in NP 12-203, including the issuance of bi-weekly default status reports in the form of news releases. The Company confirms as of the date of this news release that there has been no material change in the information contained in the default announcement issued on May 3, 2022 and there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed.

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:10:00+00:00,"ROSEN, TOP RANKED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Energy Transfer LP Investors with Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – ET","NEW YORK, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) between April 13, 2017 and December 20, 2021, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important August 2, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Energy Transfer securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Energy Transfer class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6844 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 2, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or concealed and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Energy Transfer had inadequate internal controls and procedures to prevent contractors from engaging in illegal conduct with regards to drilling activities, and/or failed to properly mitigate known issues related to such controls and procedures; (2) Energy Transfer through its subsidiary hired third-party contractors to conduct horizontal directional drilling activities (“HDDs”) for the Rover Pipeline Project, whose conduct of adding illegal additives in the drilling mud caused severe pollution near the Tuscarawas River in Ohio when the April 13, 2017 release of drilling mud near the Tuscarawas River (the “April 13 Release”) took place; and (3) Energy Transfer continually downplayed its potential civil liabilities when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) was actively investigating Energy Transfer’s wrongdoing related to the April 13 Release and consistently provided it with updated information about FERC’s findings on this matter. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Energy Transfer class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6844 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Banks and other financial institutions must follow know-your-customer (KYC) guidelines, but private equity funds have a loophole: They are not legally bound to tell regulators who their investors are — or if they're behaving suspiciously.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine changed that, however.

The increasingly isolated nation is now facing international sanctions, and ""PEs are investing in the close management of compliance programs, policies and procedures at each of their portfolio companies,"" writes Snežana Gebauer, a partner with StoneTurn.

AAPL,2022-06-30T22:01:12+00:00,Vitalik's Mom Offers Advice on How to Make It in Crypto,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.

Crypto, as big as it once was, often feels like a family affair – and sometimes that’s literally true. Natalia Ameline is the mother of Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, but she may be better known for her personal contributions to the crypto industry.

She’s the founder of CryptoChicks, an educational non-profit dedicated to supporting women, and a leader of Metis, a startup that’s building a promising scalable layer 2 companion system for Ethereum that’s run as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

“I want to be part of something great,” Ameline told CoinDesk in an interview. For her, that means being a part of a DAO and investment collective working to expand the Ethereum ecosystem.

Like other scaling systems such as Arbitrum and Optimism, Metis uses a novel technology called Optimistic roll-ups to essentially create a more efficient version of Ethereum. Although all part of the same family tree, layer 2s often develop quite distinct ecosystems – and Ameline has high ambitions that a host of non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance applications and other crypto tools will make their home on Metis.

See also: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same

“You need to have a lot of perseverance and a lot of patience,” she said when asked what it takes to find success in crypto. It’s those qualities she sees in Vitalik that help explain his success: He was willing to “stick around” and put the time in, she said. “It wasn’t easy.”

CoinDesk caught up with Ameline for “Future of Work Week,” to hear more about her contributions to crypto, the changing nature of work and how her son’s invention is changing the world. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

Considering your background in business administration accounting, what does your day-to-day look like doing investor relations at a DAO?

I am a lead on the ecosystem fund, which we call Genesi, that invests in projects building on Metis. We look at projects that come to build on Metis, which fit what we're looking for, select the best projects and present them to investors.

Story continues

Genesi is a bit unusual – It's essentially a joint project by investors of Metis. Everyone [involved] was super passionate about our ecosystem and looking to support it so they got together and formed an investment fund. It’s maybe more like an investment club.

We’re trying to create a DAO, and will actually be operated on-chain in the future. We're building infrastructure for that. But at the moment, Genesi exists offline, if you will.

What is missing from DAO tooling today?

I think one of the tools that will really help a lot is actually reputation power, which is something that Metis will launch shortly – a product called Matrix. It's a reputation power system based on the concept of soulbound tokens that will allow you to have your digital identity online.

It’s a bit like an on-chain resume, where you will have tokens for you to participate in different activities – contributing to different deals or open source projects, going to university or doing work for some charity.

The idea could be useful not just for individuals but for companies. It also could become part of your credit score. It's really like your identity on-chain. And once DAOs are equipped with that you also will be able to see the ranking of contributors.

Do you think DAOs are already changing how we work?

People don't want to work for someone, they want to work for themselves. Some people are forming these cooperatives. For example, one of the projects we'll talk about is like a cooperative of developers. So they all formed a DAO. The DAO can subcontract to any companies that are looking for developers.

This work can become part of your on-chain history, and then you build your resume that way. You will be able to see on-chain what exactly individuals have been working on, how successful they were, what their rating is, etc.

There are many different opportunities there. I think a lot of them maybe haven't even been explored yet. Somebody asked me, what's a great use case [for crypto]? It's something that hasn't been developed yet! We're very early. I keep saying that.

I really think that this gig economy that everybody is talking about is going to be a big thing. Younger people just want to do their own thing, they want to work independently, they want to travel, they don't want to have to be connected to any particular one entity. They want to be the owners of their time.

And I think working in cooperatives like this really helps. Because you can work when you want, how you want and with whom you want.

Do you consider yourself as someone with power or influence? What do you think of your own success or influence in crypto or the bigger world?

No, I don't consider myself in that way. I positioned myself as a member of the team. I want to be part of something great that we're building, and I am super happy that I can contribute to Metis.

If we step back to CryptoChicks, I'm super happy I am part of it and co-founder of it. We were able to, and continue to be able to, help women around the world to learn about what crypto technology has to offer. A lot of them got into the business.

As the co-founder of CryptoChicks, what do you think about women in crypto now? Is it hard for women in this industry?

I think the situation with women in crypto has improved a lot. There are many organizations around the world that are working on similar goals as CryptoChicks. There are so many more females who are not just part of the scene, but they are also active members of projects.

How could crypto fundamentally change how we work?

Crypto is already providing alternatives. Traditional fundraising is very different from what's in crypto. Back in 2017, there were a lot of ICOs (initial coin offerings) that were put up. We're raising money now for communities on distributed platforms. Crypto democratizes access to money. Instead of getting it from one fund, you really can run a global fundraiser, it simplifies the way you can do it.

I think it democratizes the labor market, too. Right now, you don't need to work in a certain country to do a certain type of job in crypto. As long as they qualify to do the work, nothing prevents you from getting employed. Also, you don’t need to wire money through the complex bank account system. You can do it pretty fast. You can transfer it from one country to the next without any issues, which is convenient for companies.

What do you think of Vitalik’s success?

I'm super happy for him, obviously. I think he accomplished a lot for somebody of his age. I think he owes his success also for perseverance and patience, and sticking around and putting a lot of time into it. It wasn't easy. You really have to love what you do. And I think Vitalik really enjoys what he does. He's passionate about it, and he works tirelessly on it.

What advice would you give to someone trying to make it in crypto?

I would say that you need to have a lot of perseverance and a lot of patience. If you got into crypto as an investment, you really need to be able to kind of stick with it. I see a mistake a lot of people are making: They will invest and when the market turns the wrong way they get out, sometimes at a loss. And they never want to go back anymore because they got burned. It’s painful.

I think with anything in life, in order to succeed you really need to study it. And you need to stick around and persevere despite your experiences. So you do need a lot of patience. And you do need to be able to say right now is a bear market, but we'll just keep working. We'll keep focusing and we will get there.

I think people should not be afraid to try new things. It's hard to make a jump and go into the unknown. My suggestion would be to try as many things as you can. I think when you grow older, the only experiences that you remember [should not be] how you sit in the office and [at] the same desk for the last 40 years.

HAMPTON, N.J., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLDX) today announced interim data from the Company’s ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of barzolvolimab in patients with moderate to severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to antihistamines. Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT with high specificity and potently inhibits its activity, which is required for mast cell function and survival. CSU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals for 6 weeks or longer without identifiable specific triggers or causes.

Data show that multiple doses of barzolvolimab resulted in dose-dependent decreases in itch and hives, as measured through the urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7), with a mean UAS7 reduction of 66.6% in all patients in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=8) at week 12 and 75.1% in all patients in the ongoing 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=9) at week 8 (reflects one dose), demonstrating meaningful symptom improvements for patients. Complete response as measured by UAS7=0 was 57.1% for patients in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group at week 12 and 44.4% for the patients in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing).

Importantly, administering multiple doses of barzolvolimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile, supporting Phase 2 clinical development. These data were presented by Dr. Marcus Maurer, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, as a late-breaking electronic poster presentation (#100097) as part of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress 2022.

“We are excited by these interim multiple dose data which demonstrate strong clinical activity, rapid onset and sustained durability with a well-tolerated safety profile, including in patients with prior omalizumab experience,” commented Anthony S. Marucci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Celldex Therapeutics. “We believe these impressive early data further demonstrate barzolvolimab’s unique mechanism and its potential to provide meaningful symptom relief to patients suffering from diseases driven by mast cells. These data support the continued development of barzolvolimab, including our recently initiated Phase 2 chronic urticaria studies.”

“These remarkable early results confirm that chronic urticaria is driven by mast cells and barzolvolimab has again demonstrated its ability to bring meaningful improvements to patients suffering from these often very severe and debilitating diseases,” said Marcus Maurer, M.D., Professor of Dermatology and Allergy at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin and a lead investigator on the study. “There are extensive numbers of patients globally with CSU who cannot be helped at all with the current standard of care, so barzolvolimab would represent a considerable advance in the treatment landscape for these patients and potentially other diseases with mast cell involvement.”

Summary of Data from Ongoing Phase 1b CSU Trial of Barzolvolimab

As of the data cut-off on May 23, 2022, 34 patients with CSU were enrolled and treated [26 barzolvolimab (n=9 in 0.5 mg/kg; n=8 in 1.5 mg/kg; n=9 in 3.0 mg/kg) and 8 placebo]. The 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg cohorts had completed study participation through 24 weeks; 7 of 12 patients in the 3.0 mg/kg cohort had completed week 12; enrollment in the 4.5 mg/kg cohort was ongoing. Adverse events through data cutoff and hematology data through week 12 were included for all dose groups; clinical activity and tryptase data were included through week 12 for 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg, and through week 8 for 3 mg/kg (ongoing; reflecting the administration of only one dose).

Interim Clinical Activity Results

Barzolvolimab results in rapid, marked and durable responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines, including patients with prior omalizumab treatment.Mean reduction from baseline in urticaria activity (UAS7) of 66.6% in all patients in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=8) at week 12 and 75.1% in all patients in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=9) at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing), demonstrating clinically meaningful symptom improvements for patients.Complete response (UAS7=0) of 57.1% in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group at week 12 and 44.4% at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing) in the 3 mg/kg dose group which is a key therapeutic goal.75% well-controlled disease by Urticaria Control Test (UCT) in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group at week 12 and 83.3% in the 3 mg/kg dose group at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing).Patients with prior omalizumab therapy had similar symptom improvement as all patients.All three doses of barzolvolimab markedly improved urticaria symptoms and disease control, with rapid improvement in itch and hives. As predicted, the lowest dose of 0.5 mg/kg resulted in suboptimal clinical activity compared to the higher doses.Rapid onset of responses after initial dosing and sustained durability were observed; onset as early as 1 week after the first dose.Tryptase suppression, indicative of mast cell depletion, paralleled symptom improvement, demonstrating the impact of mast cell depletion on CSU disease activity.

Summary of Clinical Activity Assessments at week 12 for 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg dose groups and week 8 for 3.0 mg/kg dose group (ongoing, clinical activity reflects one dose):

The UAS7 score is calculated as the sum over 7 days of the daily intensity of itch (ISS7 itch severity score) and number of hives (HSS7 hives severity score). UAS7 values range from 0 to 42, with higher values reflecting higher disease activity. UCT has 4 items with 5 answer options (scored with 0-4 points); recall period of 4 weeks. Low points indicate high disease activity and low disease control. The minimum and maximum UCT scores are 0 and 16, with 16 points indicating complete disease control and ≥12 indicating well controlled disease.

Safety Results

Barzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile; effects of multiple dose administration were consistent with observations in single dose studies.Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved while on study, with none leading to treatment discontinuation. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were urinary tract infections, headache, neutropenia and back pain. UTIs, headache and backpain were all reported as unrelated to treatment. There was one severe adverse event of salmonella gastroenteritis which was also not related to study therapy.Changes in hematologic parameters were consistent with observations in single dose studies, with no pattern of further decreases with multiple doses; hematologic values generally remained within the normal range. Four patients with screening and baseline neutrophil counts at the lower end of the normal range on study initiation had decreases in neutrophil counts reported as AEs. The pattern observed in the neutrophil changes for these patients was similar to the pattern seen in patients across the barzolvolimab program to date—generally transient, asymptomatic, and mild.

The Phase 1b study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety of multiple ascending doses of barzolvolimab in patients with moderate to severe CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with antihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels and clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response) as well as quality of life assessments. The study is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients with CSU across four cohorts (8 barzolvolimab; 2 placebo). Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously at 0.5 mg/kg mg every 4 weeks, 1.5 mg/kg every 4 weeks, 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, 4.5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, as add-on treatment to H1-antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor agonists.

About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)
CSU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals for 6 weeks or longer without identifiable specific triggers or causes. The activation of the mast cells in the skin (release of histamines, leukotrienes, chemokines) results in episodes of itchy hives, swelling and inflammation of the skin that can go on for years or even decades. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief only in some patients.

About Barzolvolimab
Barzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT with high specificity and potently inhibits its activity. KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, which mediate inflammatory responses such as hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. KIT signaling controls the differentiation, tissue recruitment, survival and activity of mast cells. In certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic urticaria, mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease.

OSAKA, Japan & CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Takeda (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced late-breaking data from the Phase 3 SPRING study (NCT04070326) presented at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Hybrid Congress 2022, demonstrating positive results of TAKHZYRO® (lanadelumab) for preventing hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in patients 2 to <12 years of age, which were consistent with earlier studies in adult and adolescent patients.1 There are currently no long-term prophylactic (LTP) treatments approved for HAE patients younger than 6 years.2, 3, 4, 5

The primary objective of the open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 SPRING study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAKHZYRO in patients aged 2 to <12 years with HAE. Clinical outcomes (prevention of HAE attacks) were measured as a secondary objective.

""HAE is a rare condition where unpredictable symptoms like severely debilitating swelling can take a toll on children both physically and emotionally,"" said Dr. Marcus Maurer, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany and principal investigator of the SPRING study. ""In the SPRING study, we saw a majority of children who had been suffering nearly two HAE attacks per month on average at baseline, who were then attack-free throughout the 52-week trial of treatment with TAKHZYRO.""

In this study, HAE patients received a dose of 150 milligrams (mg) every 4 weeks in patients 2 to <6 years and every 2 weeks in patients aged 6 to <12 years.1 TAKHZYRO reduced the rate of HAE attacks in children by a mean of 94.8% compared to baseline, from 1.84 attacks per month to 0.08 attacks during treatment.1 The majority of patients (76.2%) were attack-free during the 52-week treatment period with an average of 99.5% attack-free days.1 No deaths or serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported during the study, and no patients withdrew from the study due to TEAEs.1 The most commonly reported TEAE was injection site pain, and most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.6 These results are consistent with the favorable efficacy and safety profile of TAKHYZRO observed in earlier studies with adult and adolescent patients.1,7,8

HAE attacks, which can involve serious and severely debilitating swelling in the abdomen, face, feet, genitals, hands and throat, may occur very early in childhood. Potentially fatal upper airway angioedema has been reported in patients as young as 3 years old.9,10 HAE diagnosis can take an average of 8.4 years after symptom onset.8 Among adults living with HAE, 50% of patients experience anxiety, 34% experience difficulty with social activity and 58% report symptoms negatively affect career advancements.11

""The SPRING study data reinforce the safety and efficacy of TAKHZYRO across a broad range of patients living with HAE,"" said Ming Yu, Global Clinical Lead, Takeda. ""We are encouraged by these findings as they demonstrate the potential of long-term prophylaxis treatments to reduce recurrent HAE attacks in children as young as two who currently have no approved long-term preventative treatment option.""

Results From the Open-label, Multicenter Phase 3 SPRING study include:1

Overall, the attack rate during lanadelumab treatment was reduced by ~95% versus baseline.

The extent of reduction was similar between patients who received 150 mg lanadelumab q4w or q2w. Systemic exposure to lanadelumab was demonstrated. Compared with adults and older adolescents who received 300 mg q2w:

Steady-state exposure with 150 mg q2w in patients aged 6 to <12 years was similar. Minimum steady-state concentrations with 150 mg q4w were 50–60% lower in patients aged 2 to <6 years but were sufficient to produce a clinically meaningful treatment response. 16 (76.2%) patients were attack-free during the full treatment period. A mean (range) of 99.5% (96.4–100) of days were attack-free. Overall, 17 (81.0%) patients reported any TEAEs.

7 (33.3%) patients reported any TEAE related to treatment; all were related to the injection site. The profile of related TEAEs was similar between the two treatment groups. There were no deaths, serious TEAEs, hospitalisations or discontinuations due to TEAEs. There were no adverse events of special interest (hypersensitivity reactions, hypercoagulability and bleeding events). No clinically meaningful safety findings were identified with respect to clinical laboratory tests or vital signs.

These data will be submitted to global regulatory authorities to evaluate a potential label expansion for TAKHZYRO to include the younger patient population.

Takeda will have a total of 11 presentations at EAACI:

About SPRING Study SHP643-301, also known as the SPRING study, is a multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAKHZYRO in patients aged 2 to <12 years with HAE.1 Participants aged 2 to <6 years received lanadelumab at a dose of 150 milligrams (mg) every 4 weeks (q4wks) over a 52-week treatment period. Participants aged 6 to <12 years received lanadelumab at a dose of 150 mg every 2 weeks (q2wks) over a 52-week treatment period and had the option to reduce the dose frequency to q4wks if they were well controlled (e.g., attack-free) for 26 weeks.1 HAE attack rates were analysed using descriptive statistics.1

About TAKHZYRO® (lanadelumab-flyo) Injection TAKHZYRO is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and decreases plasma kallikrein and is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of HAE in patients aged 12 years and older. It was studied in one of the largest prevention studies in HAE with the longest active treatment duration, and TAKHZYRO consistently demonstrated HAE attack reduction. TAKHZYRO is formulated for subcutaneous administration and has a half-life of approximately two weeks.8 TAKHZYRO is intended for self-administration or administration by a caregiver once trained by a healthcare professional.

TAKHZYRO Safety Information for Europe Please consult the TAKHZYRO Summary Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.

TAKHZYRO treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). TAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC injection technique by a healthcare professional.

Contraindication Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.8

Warnings and Precautions Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.8

Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, administration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be initiated.8

General: TAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE attack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication. There are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH activity.5

Interference with coagulation test: Lanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of lanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients treated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no differences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.8

Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.8

Interactions No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of lanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected.

As expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive effect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab and C1 esterase inhibitor.8

Immunogenicity Treatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was transient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.8

The development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.5

Immunogenicity The most commonly observed adverse reaction (52.4%) associated with TAKHZYRO was injection site reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of these ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration of 6 minutes.8

Hypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was observed (1.2%)8

Very common
(frequency ≥1/10): Injection site reactions* Common
(≥1/100 to <1/10): Hypersensitivity**, dizziness, rash maculo-papular, myalgia, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased.

*Injection site reactions include: pain, erythema, bruising, discomfort, haematoma, haemorrhage, pruritus, swelling, induration, paraesthesia, reaction, warmth, oedema and rash.8 ** Hypersensitivity includes: pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue.8

HAMPTON, N.J., June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLDX) today announced interim data from the Company’s ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial of barzolvolimab in patients with moderate to severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to antihistamines. Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT with high specificity and potently inhibits its activity, which is required for mast cell function and survival. CSU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals for 6 weeks or longer without identifiable specific triggers or causes.

Data show that multiple doses of barzolvolimab resulted in dose-dependent decreases in itch and hives, as measured through the urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7), with a mean UAS7 reduction of 66.6% in all patients in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=8) at week 12 and 75.1% in all patients in the ongoing 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=9) at week 8 (reflects one dose), demonstrating meaningful symptom improvements for patients. Complete response as measured by UAS7=0 was 57.1% for patients in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group at week 12 and 44.4% for the patients in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing).

Importantly, administering multiple doses of barzolvolimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile, supporting Phase 2 clinical development. These data were presented by Dr. Marcus Maurer, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, as a late-breaking electronic poster presentation (#100097) as part of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Annual Congress 2022.

Story continues

“We are excited by these interim multiple dose data which demonstrate strong clinical activity, rapid onset and sustained durability with a well-tolerated safety profile, including in patients with prior omalizumab experience,” commented Anthony S. Marucci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Celldex Therapeutics. “We believe these impressive early data further demonstrate barzolvolimab’s unique mechanism and its potential to provide meaningful symptom relief to patients suffering from diseases driven by mast cells. These data support the continued development of barzolvolimab, including our recently initiated Phase 2 chronic urticaria studies.”

“These remarkable early results confirm that chronic urticaria is driven by mast cells and barzolvolimab has again demonstrated its ability to bring meaningful improvements to patients suffering from these often very severe and debilitating diseases,” said Marcus Maurer, M.D., Professor of Dermatology and Allergy at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin and a lead investigator on the study. “There are extensive numbers of patients globally with CSU who cannot be helped at all with the current standard of care, so barzolvolimab would represent a considerable advance in the treatment landscape for these patients and potentially other diseases with mast cell involvement.”

Summary of Data from Ongoing Phase 1b CSU Trial of Barzolvolimab

As of the data cut-off on May 23, 2022, 34 patients with CSU were enrolled and treated [26 barzolvolimab (n=9 in 0.5 mg/kg; n=8 in 1.5 mg/kg; n=9 in 3.0 mg/kg) and 8 placebo]. The 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg cohorts had completed study participation through 24 weeks; 7 of 12 patients in the 3.0 mg/kg cohort had completed week 12; enrollment in the 4.5 mg/kg cohort was ongoing. Adverse events through data cutoff and hematology data through week 12 were included for all dose groups; clinical activity and tryptase data were included through week 12 for 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg, and through week 8 for 3 mg/kg (ongoing; reflecting the administration of only one dose).

Interim Clinical Activity Results

Barzolvolimab results in rapid, marked and durable responses in patients with moderate to severe CSU refractory to antihistamines, including patients with prior omalizumab treatment. Mean reduction from baseline in urticaria activity (UAS7) of 66.6% in all patients in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group (n=8) at week 12 and 75.1% in all patients in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group (n=9) at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing), demonstrating clinically meaningful symptom improvements for patients. Complete response (UAS7=0) of 57.1% in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group at week 12 and 44.4% at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing) in the 3 mg/kg dose group which is a key therapeutic goal. 75% well-controlled disease by Urticaria Control Test (UCT) in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group at week 12 and 83.3% in the 3 mg/kg dose group at week 8 (reflects one dose; ongoing). Patients with prior omalizumab therapy had similar symptom improvement as all patients. All three doses of barzolvolimab markedly improved urticaria symptoms and disease control, with rapid improvement in itch and hives. As predicted, the lowest dose of 0.5 mg/kg resulted in suboptimal clinical activity compared to the higher doses. Rapid onset of responses after initial dosing and sustained durability were observed; onset as early as 1 week after the first dose. Tryptase suppression, indicative of mast cell depletion, paralleled symptom improvement, demonstrating the impact of mast cell depletion on CSU disease activity.

Summary of Clinical Activity Assessments at week 12 for 0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg dose groups and week 8 for 3.0 mg/kg dose group (ongoing, clinical activity reflects one dose):

The UAS7 score is calculated as the sum over 7 days of the daily intensity of itch (ISS7 itch severity score) and number of hives (HSS7 hives severity score). UAS7 values range from 0 to 42, with higher values reflecting higher disease activity. UCT has 4 items with 5 answer options (scored with 0-4 points); recall period of 4 weeks. Low points indicate high disease activity and low disease control. The minimum and maximum UCT scores are 0 and 16, with 16 points indicating complete disease control and ≥12 indicating well controlled disease.

Safety Results

Barzolvolimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile; effects of multiple dose administration were consistent with observations in single dose studies. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved while on study, with none leading to treatment discontinuation. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were urinary tract infections, headache, neutropenia and back pain. UTIs, headache and backpain were all reported as unrelated to treatment. There was one severe adverse event of salmonella gastroenteritis which was also not related to study therapy. Changes in hematologic parameters were consistent with observations in single dose studies, with no pattern of further decreases with multiple doses; hematologic values generally remained within the normal range. Four patients with screening and baseline neutrophil counts at the lower end of the normal range on study initiation had decreases in neutrophil counts reported as AEs. The pattern observed in the neutrophil changes for these patients was similar to the pattern seen in patients across the barzolvolimab program to date—generally transient, asymptomatic, and mild.

The Phase 1b study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety of multiple ascending doses of barzolvolimab in patients with moderate to severe CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with antihistamines. Secondary and exploratory objectives include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments, including measurement of tryptase and stem cell factor levels and clinical activity outcomes (impact on urticaria symptoms, disease control, clinical response) as well as quality of life assessments. The study is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients with CSU across four cohorts (8 barzolvolimab; 2 placebo). Barzolvolimab is administered intravenously at 0.5 mg/kg mg every 4 weeks, 1.5 mg/kg every 4 weeks, 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, 4.5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, as add-on treatment to H1-antihistamines, either alone or in combination with H2-antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor agonists.

About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)
CSU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals for 6 weeks or longer without identifiable specific triggers or causes. The activation of the mast cells in the skin (release of histamines, leukotrienes, chemokines) results in episodes of itchy hives, swelling and inflammation of the skin that can go on for years or even decades. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief only in some patients.

About Barzolvolimab
Barzolvolimab (also referred to as CDX-0159) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT with high specificity and potently inhibits its activity. KIT is expressed in a variety of cells, including mast cells, which mediate inflammatory responses such as hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. KIT signaling controls the differentiation, tissue recruitment, survival and activity of mast cells. In certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic urticaria, mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease.

CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

All Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resources estimates reported by the Company were estimated in accordance with the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum Definition Standards (May 10, 2014). These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

This document contains ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation and ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information and these statements, referred to herein as ""forward-looking statements"" are made as of the date of this document. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect current estimates, predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:

(i)the estimated amount and grade of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves;(ii)the PFS representing a viable development option for the Project;(iii)estimates of the capital costs of constructing mine facilities and bringing a mine into production, of sustaining capital and the duration of financing payback periods;(iv)the estimated amount of future production, both produced and sold;(v)timing of disclosure for the PFS and recommendations from the Special Committee;(vi)the Company’s competitive position in Brazil and demand for potash; and,(vii)estimates of operating costs and total costs, net cash flow, net present value and economic returns from an operating mine.

Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as ""expects"", ""anticipates"", ""plans"", ""projects"", ""estimates"", ""envisages"", ""assumes"", ""intends"", ""strategy"", ""goals"", ""objectives"" or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events or results ""may"", ""could"", ""would"", ""might"" or ""will"" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements are based on Verde's or its consultants' current beliefs as well as various assumptions made by them and information currently available to them. The most significant assumptions are set forth above, but generally these assumptions include, but are not limited to:

(i)the presence of and continuity of resources and reserves at the Project at estimated grades;(ii)the geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results; including the quantities of water and the quality of the water that must be diverted or treated during mining operations;(iii)the capacities and durability of various machinery and equipment;(iv)the availability of personnel, machinery and equipment at estimated prices and within the estimated delivery times;(v)currency exchange rates;(vi)Super Greensand® and K Forte® sales prices, market size and exchange rate assumed;(vii)appropriate discount rates applied to the cash flows in the economic analysis;(viii)tax rates and royalty rates applicable to the proposed mining operation;(ix)the availability of acceptable financing under assumed structure and costs;(x)anticipated mining losses and dilution;(xi)reasonable contingency requirements;(xii)success in realizing proposed operations;(xiii)receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms; and(xiv)the fulfilment of environmental assessment commitments and arrangements with local communities.

Although management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. Many forward-looking statements are made assuming the correctness of other forward looking statements, such as statements of net present value and internal rates of return, which are based on most of the other forward-looking statements and assumptions herein. The cost information is also prepared using current values, but the time for incurring the costs will be in the future and it is assumed costs will remain stable over the relevant period.

By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and risks exist that estimates, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved or that assumptions do not reflect future experience. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual outcomes to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates assumptions and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be generally stated as the risk that the assumptions and estimates expressed above do not occur as forecast, but specifically include, without limitation: risks relating to variations in the mineral content within the material identified as Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves from that predicted; variations in rates of recovery and extraction; the geotechnical characteristics of the rock mined or through which infrastructure is built differing from that predicted, the quantity of water that will need to be diverted or treated during mining operations being different from what is expected to be encountered during mining operations or post closure, or the rate of flow of the water being different; developments in world metals markets; risks relating to fluctuations in the Brazilian Real relative to the Canadian dollar; increases in the estimated capital and operating costs or unanticipated costs; difficulties attracting the necessary work force; increases in financing costs or adverse changes to the terms of available financing, if any; tax rates or royalties being greater than assumed; changes in development or mining plans due to changes in logistical, technical or other factors; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; risks relating to receipt of regulatory approvals; delays in stakeholder negotiations; changes in regulations applying to the development, operation, and closure of mining operations from what currently exists; the effects of competition in the markets in which Verde operates; operational and infrastructure risks and the additional risks described in Verde's Annual Information Form filed with SEDAR in Canada (available at www.sedar.com) for the year ended December 31, 2021. Verde cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive.

When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to Verde, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Verde does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by Verde or on our behalf, except as required by law.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hillcrest Energy Technologies (CSE: HEAT) (OTCQB: HLRTF) (FRA: 7HIA.F) (“Hillcrest” or the “Company”), a clean tech innovation company developing transformative power conversion technologies and control-system solutions for next-generation electrical systems, is pleased to announce the results of voting at its Annual General Meeting held Wednesday, June 29, 2022.

Shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favour of all items put forward by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and Management. Hillcrest’s current seven (7) member Board, consisting of David Farrell, Donald J. Currie, Michael Moskowitz, Kylie Dickson, Mike Krzus, Robert Lambert and Thomas G. Milne, have all been re-elected.

Shareholders also voted in favour of: (i) receiving and considering the consolidated audited financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended December 31, 2021; (ii) setting the number of Directors at seven; (iii) electing Directors for the ensuing year as noted above; (iv) appointing DeVisser Gray LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants as auditor of the Company.

Election of New Board Chair

Upon conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting, Michael Krzus stepped down as Executive Chair of Hillcrest and the Board elected David Farrell to serve as the incoming Chair. Mr. Krzus has redomiciled to Perth, Australia, and believes the person holding the Chair position should be located closer to the Company, in a more accessible time zone. As stated above, Mr. Krzus remains a member of the Board and will provide management consulting services to the Company going forward.

Mr. Farrell, who has served on the Hillcrest Board for the past year, offers more than 25 years of corporate and investment banking experience. “Throughout Mr. Farrell’s career, he has worked with several global junior and mid-tier companies through major growth trajectories. As the new Board Chair, Dave will be well-positioned to help steer Hillcrest into our maturation as a clean energy technology company,” stated Don Currie, Hillcrest CEO.

“On behalf of the Company, I’d like to thank Mike Krzus for his dedication and leadership over the past seven years as the Chair of the Board,” continued CEO Currie. “Mike brought focused structure and governance through his tenure as Chair, and he is stepping down from the role with Hillcrest being a stronger company than when he accepted the position.”

Exit from Oilfield Complete

Hillcrest, through a wholly owned subsidiary, has ceased oil and gas operations at its West Hazel field in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Saskatchewan, completing the Company’s exit from the fossil fuel business. This decision will enable the Company to completely focus its efforts on the commercializing its clean technologies.

“Hillcrest has a singular focus and that is developing its clean energy technologies. The oil and gas assets were in direct public conflict with the direction the company is pursuing, requiring the assets to either be sold or remediated,” said CEO Currie. “As the field became non-commercial, the decision to remediate was the only one available. Ceasing oil and gas operations has better enabled us to achieve our technology commercialization goals, potentially attract the financial and investor support from those who could not or would not support hydrocarbon activities, and continue to work towards generating long-term shareholder value.”

As part of Hillcrest’s commitment to environmentally responsible operations, the Company proactively initiated abandonment activities at its West Hazel field last year. Seven non-commercial wellbores have already been plugged and capped, with the remaining two wellbores currently being plugged and capped as well. In addition, initial surface reclamation planning is underway with completion expected within the next few years. Initiating these abandonment activities significantly reduced the Company’s environmental footprint and long-term Asset Retirement Liability costs.

First Apartments in Miami’s East Little Havana Neighborhood

Walker & Dunlop's Still Hunter and Kaya Suarez represented the buyer, Lloyd Jones, and the seller, Premium Development, in the transaction. The Walker & Dunlop team acted as advisors and drove a competitive marketing process to ensure an attractive outcome for ownership. This sale represents the first transaction between all three parties as well as Premium Development's first U.S. multifamily project.

""Since opening its doors in late September, First Apartments has enjoyed an increase in lease rates with recent leases signed for more than 25% above initial leases,"" said Roger Karré, the Chief Operations Officer at Premium Development. ""With rental rates that are nearly $500 below communities with comparable finishes and amenities, First Apartments enjoys the enviable position as the best value in the local competitive set. The impressive lease-up performance is a testament to the appeal of the asset and its prime location, proximate to key demand drivers, entertainment venues, and transit routes.""

""With the insatiable demand for moderately priced luxury rental options in South Florida, First Apartments meets the growing needs of Miami residents seeking value relative to Brickell and Downtown Miami's rental options,"" commented Mr. Hunter. ""The new community is also an excellent investment opportunity given its proximity to Miami's commercial business district, boasting nearly 22 million square feet of office space and 125,000 jobs.""

Developed with incredible attention to detail and a focus on smart design, First Apartments is the premier luxury rental option in East Little Havana.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:58:00+00:00,"ROSEN, A TOP RANKED LAW FIRM, Encourages Dentsply Sirona Inc. Investors with Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – XRAY","NEW YORK, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the common stock of Dentsply Sirona Inc. (NASDAQ: XRAY) between June 9, 2021 and May 9, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important August 1, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Dentsply common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Dentsply class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6111 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 1, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants orchestrated a scheme to inflate Dentsply’s revenue and earnings by manipulating its accounting for a distributor rebate program in order for senior executives to be eligible for significant cash and stock-based incentive compensation; (2) in order to facilitate this scheme, Dentsply and its executives made numerous false and misleading statements to investors during the Class Period; (3) accordingly, Dentsply’s financial statements were not prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC rules, and Dentsply’s internal controls over financial reporting were deficient throughout the Class Period; and (4) as a result of defendants’ misrepresentations, Dentsply’s common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. As a result of the foregoing, When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Dentsply class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6111 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

“The deal will see only a small quota for New Zealand beef into the European Union -- 10,000 tons into a market that consumes 6.5 million tons of beef annually -- far less than the red meat sector’s expectations,” Sirma Karapeeva, chief executive of the Meat Industry Association, said in a statement Friday in Wellington. “We are extremely disappointed that this agreement does not deliver commercially meaningful access for our exporters, in particular for beef.”

Ardern announced the deal overnight from Brussels, where she and Trade Minister Damien O’Connor lobbied to get an agreement over the line four years after negotiations started. They hailed it as a major achievement that will unlock New Zealand access to one of the world’s biggest and most lucrative markets.

“It’s a strategically important and economically beneficial deal that comes at a crucial time in our export-led Covid-19 recovery,” Ardern said. “It delivers tangible gains for exporters into a restrictive agricultural market.”

Under the FTA, New Zealand export revenue to the EU is estimated to grow by up to NZ$1.8 billion ($1.1 billion) annually by 2035.

It will secure duty-free access on 97% of New Zealand’s current exports to the EU, with over 91% being removed the day the FTA comes into force. Exporters will save approximately NZ$110 million per annum on tariff elimination.

The kiwifruit, wine, mānuka honey and seafood industries appear to be winners, with immediate tariff elimination for those goods.

Story continues

“We’ve fought hard for our dairy and beef exporters and the deal could deliver up to NZ$600 million in additional export revenue if access is used and once the agreement is fully in effect,” O’Connor said. “We have also secured improved access for our butter and cheese producers, some of which will now be able to be trade with the EU for the first time in many years.”

However, the New Zealand Specialist Cheesemakers Association said the country “has bowed to EU pressure” and given way on key cheese names.

Of particular concern was the loss of the name Feta, which will be phased out over nine years, said board member Daniel Shields. Europe has also succeeded in including the right to restrict new names at a future date, he said.

It is unclear when the FTA will come into force. Both parties must complete domestic legal processes and ratify the agreement, which could take several years.

– Sale of The Vive to Generate in Excess of a $21 million Gain on Sale –

GREAT NECK, N.Y., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BRT Apartments Corp. (NYSE:BRT) today announced the purchase for $7.5 million of the remaining 20% interest held by its joint venture partner in the entity that owns Grove at River Place, a 240-unit multi-family property located in Macon, Georgia. In 2021, this property contributed $107,000 in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint venture. As a result of the completion of this purchase, BRT will include on its consolidated balance sheet the approximate $10.4 million of mortgage debt currently on the property, with an interest rate of 4.39% and 3.6 years of remaining term to maturity.

BRT also announced that the unconsolidated joint venture in which it holds a 65% equity interest, completed the previously announced sale of the multi-family property, The Vive, located in Kannapolis, North Carolina, for a sales price of $91.3 million. BRT generated an approximate 39.9% internal rate of return, or IRR, from this property over the 3 ¼ years it was owned. BRT received net proceeds of approximately $30.2 million from the sale and estimates that during the quarter ending June 30, 2022, BRT will recognize a gain on sale of this property of approximately $21.5 million, after giving effect to its $745,000 share of the mortgage prepayment charge. As of March 31, 2022, this property had mortgage debt of $31.6 million with a remaining term to maturity of 30 years and an interest rate of 3.52% and in 2021, contributed $77,000 of BRT’s equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.

Management anticipates redeploying the net proceeds of the sale towards the buy-out of its partners’ interests in certain joint venture properties, paying down debt, and for general corporate and working capital purposes.

Jeffrey A. Gould, Chief Executive Officer and President commented, “We are very pleased with our purchase of the remaining 20% in Grove at River Place, furthering our strategic efforts to grow our wholly owned portfolio of high-quality assets in vibrant sunbelt markets. Additionally, the closing of the sale of The Vive demonstrates our continued ability to extract significant value from our portfolio, enhance the flexibility of our capital structure, and put us in a position to grow our portfolio over the long term. Our approach of targeted purchases and sales of properties has resulted in significant strong growth in cash flow and economic gains, and we will continue to accretively construct a portfolio designed to produce sustainable value for our stockholders for years to come.”

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:52:06+00:00,GLOBAL MARKETS-MSCI global stock index has biggest first-half drop on record,"(Updates with closing U.S. markets activity)

* S&P 500 closes book on steepest first-half slide since 1970

* Treasury yields slip for third straight day

* Oil falls on uncertainty over future OPEC+ output

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The MSCI global stock index notched its biggest first-half of a year percentage drop on record on Thursday, while the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 had its steepest percentage drop for the first six months since 1970.

Behind the slides have been concerns over the Ukraine-Russia war, soaring inflation, higher interest rates and, more recently, a possible U.S. recession.

Yields on the benchmark Treasury note are up about 150 basis points year-to-date, the largest first-half increase since the first six months of 1994.

Adding to jitters Thursday, a Commerce Department report showed U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in May. While the report suggested inflation had probably peaked, price pressures were still strong enough to leave the U.S. Federal Reserve on its aggressive policy-tightening path.

""Inflation is not something that we don't have to worry about anymore. It is expected to be with us for quite some time,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York.

Central bank chiefs from the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England met in Portugal this week and voiced their renewed commitment to control inflation no matter what pain it caused.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 253.88 points, or 0.82%, to 30,775.43, the S&P 500 lost 33.45 points, or 0.88%, to 3,785.38 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 149.16 points, or 1.33%, to 11,028.74.

Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 has lost 20.6%.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.5% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.12%.

The MSCI global stock index was down 20.9% for the first half of 2022.

The Fed's hawkishness and an investor desire for liquidity in difficult times have helped support the U.S. dollar.

Story continues

The U.S. dollar index gained 6.5% for the quarter in its biggest quarterly jump since the last quarter of 2016. The index is up 9.4% for the year to date.

On Thursday, the dollar index fell 0.343%, with the euro down 0.01% to $1.0481.

Bitcoin last fell 5.92% to $18,904.06.

Treasury yields slid for a third straight day on Thursday as investors continued to worry about a possible U.S. recession. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 10.4 basis points to 2.989% as safe-haven buying at the long end pushed prices up and yields lower.

Oil prices fell about 3% on the day. OPEC+ confirmed it would only increase output in August as much as previously announced, but left investors wondering about future output.

Brent crude futures for September delivery fell $3.42, or 3%, to settle at $109.03 per barrel. The August contract, which expires on Thursday, fell $1.45, or 1.3%, to settle at $114.81 a barrel. U.S. crude futures fell $4.02, or 3.7%, to settle at $105.76.

Spot gold dropped 0.5% to $1,807.21 an ounce.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:51:09+00:00,Worst 1H Since 1970 Ends Trading Day in the Red,"It’s been the worst first half of a year for equity markets in more than half a century. So why should the final trading day of it be anything but down? The Dow, finishing its worst trading month since March 2020 lost another -0.80% today, while the S&P 500, posting its worst 1H since Nixon was sending troops into Cambodia, fell -0.86%. The Nasdaq, -30% in just the first half of this year, lost another -1.33% today. The small-cap Russell 2000, -0.82%, posted its worst 1H ever.

Basically, we’ve just seen the past year and a half of stock-market gains go up in smoke. Fears of a hard landing in the economy as the Fed continues to raise interest rates to fight inflation continue into the second half of the year, so we’ve got that to look forward to. In any case, lots of the forward-looking puffed-up outlooks have been successfully taken out of the market going forward. But at what point will we regain traction?

Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA led the Dow components lower today, -7.27%, following the release of its fiscal Q3 results: while slightly beating on the bottom line, posting 96 cents per share, the pharma and home products retailer missed revenue estimates slightly in the quarter. Comps sales were up slightly, but U.S. business fell -7% from this time a year ago. The company announced yesterday it will not be spinning off its European-based Boots chain. For more on WBA’s earnings, click here.

After the bell today, chip-maker Micron MU beat fiscal Q3 expectations on its bottom line — $2.59 per share versus $2.44 expected — while missing modestly on sales — $8.64 billion from $8.66 billion — but falling DRAM demand helped the company drastically lower estimates on both top and bottom lines for its Q4. The Zacks consensus had earlier expected $2.71 per share on $9.29 billion in revenues, but now he company guides to $1.63 per share and $7.2 billion, respectively. This guidance sent shares way down in late trading, but have buoyed partly back since.

If we’re looking for good news, there is some: in this morning’s Personal Consumption numbers, we saw a big pullback for the month of May. Moves like this will eventually begin showing up in future inflation data. China finally looks ready to re-emerge from its self-imposed Covid restrictions and begin to again contribute to growth and key supply chain avenues. Two-year and 10-year bond yields have both sunk beneath 3% (though separated by single-digit basis points, which we’d rather not see), indicating the bond market is taking into account the cooling economy.

In short, it may not be pretty, but economic changes are underway. If we son’t know what the end result will be, that’s reason enough for the market to sell off. But as elements begin to come into focus, we’ll start removing some of these question marks and perhaps start replacing them with black ink. Here’s to a stronger 2H 2022!

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:50:09+00:00,Golar LNG (GLNG) Dips More Than Broader Markets: What You Should Know,"Golar LNG (GLNG) closed at $22.75 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.81% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.88%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.82%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.08%.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the operator of carriers for natural gas shipping had lost 13.09% over the past month. This has lagged the Transportation sector's loss of 6.72% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.06% in that time.

Investors will be hoping for strength from Golar LNG as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Golar LNG is projected to report earnings of $0.24 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 442.86%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $88.66 million, down 13.27% from the prior-year quarter.

GLNG's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.91 per share and revenue of $399.63 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -44.85% and -9.45%, respectively.

Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Golar LNG should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 10.57% higher within the past month. Golar LNG currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

Investors should also note Golar LNG's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.56. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 3.4, so we one might conclude that Golar LNG is trading at a premium comparatively.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:47:00+00:00,Public Statement to Be Issued on Behalf of Councillor Ron Starr to the Canadian Press,"CITY OF MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following are statements from Councillor Ron Starr:

I am aware that the Integrity Commissioner has released a report which makes a finding that I damaged Karen Ras’ vehicle. The Integrity Commissioner’s findings are simply wrong.

I stand by my previous statement that I absolutely deny the allegations made against me. I am very sorry Karen Ras was subjected to harassment, but I am not the person who harassed her, and I will continue to fight to clear my name.

After 5 months of investigation, the Integrity Commissioner’s report contains no evidence whatsoever of any interaction between myself and Karen Ras. The Integrity Commissioner’s conclusion is simply that “it is more likely than not” that I scratched Ras’ vehicle. I maintain that I never scratched Ras’ vehicle. There is no evidence that I harassed her. The standard that the Integrity Commissioner has used to find me guilty of such conduct is simply inappropriate.

I am very disappointed that the Integrity Commissioner would choose to release his report in the face of my objections that this investigation has been unfair, biased and politically motivated.

This report was intentionally released and designed to obtain a strategic advantage, while preventing me to make my case publicly. The Integrity Commissioner has muzzled me by refusing to allow me to put my complete evidence into the public record which discloses how this investigation has been improperly authorized, biased and unfair.

The Integrity Commissioner also refused to allow me to fully disclose publicly the independent expert reports which I obtained which in my view exonerate me of the false allegations made against me.

Specifically, I obtained expert reports from:

an expert who found that I could not have committed the act as alleged;an accident reconstructionist who confirms that the video does not show me causing the damage and accepts my evidence as credible; andvarious medical reports which confirm that I was physically unable to commit the acts alleged due to injuries I sustained when I was hit by a truck while walking on April 13, 2019.

I am not able to disclose the complete reports of my experts at this time, as the Integrity Commissioner has refused to consent to their full release, without redactions, to the public.

I wish to further make clear that I have respected this process throughout. In particular, I addressed this issue in 2021 when Ras’ allegations were first brought to my attention. Even though I have always denied the allegation, I immediately resolved this matter with Ras privately, as we are encouraged to do by our Code of Conduct. I want to be clear that I paid to repair Ras’ vehicle on the advice of my legal counsel, Gary Mooney and not because I caused the damage alleged. To clear my name, I provided the Integrity Commissioner with a statement from my lawyer, Mr. Mooney who confirmed that I always denied causing the alleged damage and that neither he nor I ever admitted to me being guilty of these allegations. My lawyer further confirmed he gave me the advice to pay for the damage as it was a quick way to resolve the issue, without having to defend the false allegations against me.

In his report, the Integrity Commissioner completely rejects my personal evidence on what I was doing in the parking garage on the day of alleged damage, the evidence of my lawyer, and the opinions of each of my 4 experts who all independently opined that I would not be capable of causing the damage alleged. However, it is compelling that after I released my statement to the Integrity Commissioner explaining my response to the false allegation made against me, at no point did the Integrity Commissioner:

ask me for any clarification of any matters, or ask to interview me or speak with me directly;ask for any clarification on any matters, or ask to interview or speak with my lawyer, Mr. Mooney directly;ask for any clarification on any matters, or ask to interview or speak directly with any of my 4 experts;commission any expert reports of his own on any defences raised by me in this investigation; andcommission any expert reports which contradict the opinions advanced by the expert opinions I presented to the Integrity Commissioner as part of my defence.

I also note that the report of the Integrity Commissioner contains discrepancies and inaccuracies which I will further address in due course, given that the report was just released to me.

I maintain that not only has this investigation proceeded in an unfair and biased manner, the Integrity Commissioner has now released his report while muzzling me from publicly disclosing any of the information he provided to me in this investigation, so I cannot reveal to the public why I believe that this investigation is politically motivated and driven with bias and procedural unfairness.

I wholly dispute the report of the Integrity Commissioner and the investigation as a whole. I believe the investigation has been biased, unfair and a take down against me politically. More specifically, I believe that the investigation is politically motivated and was intentionally launched to stop me from running for re-election.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:42:00+00:00,Embraer establishes an agreement with Toyota to maximize efficiency in its production system,"SÃO JOSÉ DOS CAMPOS, Brazil, June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Embraer (B3: EMBR3, NYSE: ERJ) signed an agreement with Toyota do Brasil in order to embrace Toyota Production System (TPS) principles and concepts in its industrial operations. The initiative aims to eliminate waste, obtain operational efficiency, and increase value generation for stakeholders.

During the first phase of this joint work, a team of TPS specialists from Toyota Brazil will immerse themselves in Embraer's daily work to evaluate and suggest improvements for the company's main manufacturing area at the Ozires Silva Unit, located in São José dos Campos, São Paulo.

""Bringing Toyota to execute this work reinforces Embraer's commitment to focus on business excellence and sustainable growth,"" said Francisco Gomes Neto, CEO of Embraer. ""It will be an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and accelerate the usage of the Lean philosophy in the production systems, while strengthening practices already conducted by the Embraer Enterprise Excellence Program, the P3E.""

""TPS is a methodology that can contribute to different scenarios and occasions. More than efficiency and productivity, the TPS can provide solutions that allow industry and other sectors to continuously improve their processes, which is one of Toyota's pillars worldwide. There is still a possibility that we can contribute to the ESG agenda,"" said Rafael Chang, President of Toyota do Brasil.

Since 2007, Embraer has been following the Lean philosophy as a business strategy that spreads P3E principles, concepts, and practices. This program is responsible for leading transformations in an integrated way, paving the path for the entire company to make big steps in improving its processes. This system of excellence aims at safety first, quality always, and deliveries on time—all at the best cost.

A reference in the concept of Industry 4.0, Embraer has made immense progress at the forefront of manufacturing technologies with digital, integrated, and low environmental impact factories, with continuous improvement of processes and adaptation of technology for people and operations. From 2022, the company's goal is to grow carbon neutral and, by 2024, have 100% of energy coming from renewable sources in Brazilian operations.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:40:09+00:00,Should You Buy the Dip in Energy Stocks &amp; ETFs?,"(1:00) - Breaking Down The Recent Market Moves In Oil Prices (7:50) - Why Is Expansion So Difficult In The Oil Industry? (12:45) - Alternative Energy: Will Fossil Fuel Production Continue To Rise? (18:00) - What Should We Expect From Energy Earnings This Quarter? (21:15) - Top Stocks and ETFs To Keep On Your Radar Podcast@Zacks.com

In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Sheraz Mian, Zacks Director of Research and a former oil analyst, about energy stocks.

Energy was the best performing sector in 2021, and it is the only sector in the green this year with a gain of over 30%. These stocks have taken a beating in the past few weeks, with rising fears of a global recession.

Crude prices, which had surged to above $120 a barrel earlier this month, fell last week to around $104, before rebounding a bit this week.

President Biden is planning to travel to Middle East next month to ask for an increase in oil production but there are questions whether Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have enough spare capacity to raise production.

Biden also wants US oil companies to increase production and expand refining capacity and blames them too for high fuel costs in the country. But increasing output is not easy due to massive underinvestment in fossil fuels over the past few years amid push for transition to green energy.

Will we see a resurgence of investment in traditional energy sources if oil prices remain elevated and how will increased production of fossil fuels impact the goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050?

Sheraz believes that easy gains in energy stocks have been made as oil prices may remain around current levels in the coming months. He expects these stocks, particularly E&P companies, to remain volatile for some time. However high-quality energy stocks are still worth a look for long-term investing.

Chevron CVX,  Exxon XOM, Pioneer Natural Resources PXD, Haliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB are among the stocks he likes. Tune in to the podcast to learn more.

Popular oil ETFs like the United States Oil Fund USO use different futures strategies to track oil prices. They are good at tracking the commodity in the shorter-term but could perform much worse than the commodity in the longer-term due to contango issues.

For long-term investors, it is better to consider ETFs that hold energy companies, rather than futures. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE and the Vanguard Energy ETF VDE are market-cap-weighted ETFs. and Chevron account for about 40% of their portfolio.

The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF XOP is an equal-weighted ETF. It tilts away from the oil giants and toward small- and mid-cap companies.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:38:00+00:00,David Wallach Discusses Calgary’s Business and Real Estate Opportunities,"Beverly Hills , June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With more than 20 years of leadership experience, real estate executive David Wallach says his aim is to educate people to make the right choices.

Listen to the full interview of David Wallach with Adam Torres on the Mission Matters Money Podcast.

How did you get started in Real Estate?

Wallach’s career began in Israel, where he worked as a broker for an insurance agency, eventually working his way up to a supervisory role at a life insurance company. Over time, he grew dissatisfied with his career path and pivoted to start his own brokerage company in April 1990.

When he moved with his family to Canada in 1999, he realized while awaiting immigration clearance that Calgary’s real estate industry was on the verge of a big boom. He decided to focus on commercial real estate instead of residential, and as of Valentine’s Day 2000, he was officially in business in Canada.

Tell us about your book, “Desire, Discipline & Determination: Lessons from Bold Thought Leaders.'

Writing a book was challenging, Wallach says, because his first language is Hebrew, and he found it tough to write well in English. However, with help and support, he completed his first book and says he’s ready for the next challenge. The book, Desire, Discipline & Determination: Lessons from Bold Thought Leaders discusses leadership mistakes he’s made and the lessons he’s learned from them, inviting emerging entrepreneurs to learn from them as well and avoid those missteps for themselves.

Tell us about your radio show, “Calgary Next.”

Building on several years of experience with a previous radio program, Wallach approached a friend at a local radio station in the first year of the pandemic when everything was shut down, requesting help with a new show where he could talk to businesspeople and let people know about business prospects in Calgary. Over the past year, the show has hosted interviews with local entrepreneurs across a broad range of sectors from entertainment to health to information technology. One of the Calgary Next’s goals, he says, is to support local businesses to help with their brand visibility.

What's next for you and your ventures?

Wallach says the plan for Barclay Real Estate is to increase its market share, and he’s looking for more people to engage with Triumph Real Estate Investment Fund. The radio show, Calgary Next, will continue producing new content, and he plans to start another radio show in the future.

David Wallach was interviewed by Adam Torres of Mission Matters Money Podcast.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2472564/0/en/David-Wallach-Discusses-Calgary-s-Business-and-Real-Estate-Opportunities.html,[]
AAPL,2022-06-30T21:38:00+00:00,Jeff Neumeister on Empowering Businesses to Make Informed Financial Decisions,"Beverly Hills , June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Forensic accounting expert Jeff Neumeister talks about providing value and insights to clients through a forward-thinking, numbers-focused approach.

Listen to the full interview of Jeff Neumeister with Adam Torres on the Mission Matters Money Podcast.

How did you get started?

Neumeister has been a CPA for more than 20 years, and he started Neumeister & Associates five years ago as a full-service practice covering cryptocurrency, M&A advisory services, forensic accounting, fractional CFO work, and more. He’s also worked in academia for a decade and is currently an adjunct faculty member at Woodbury University, Burbank, teaching MBA students about accounting.

Tell us more about the fractional CFO model.

A CFO is integral for every growing organization, Neumeister notes, but it can be an expensive resource for small and mid-size companies. So, instead of paying a substantial annual salary to a full-time CFO, engaging with a fractional CFO can provide a company with necessary guidance as needed without substantial cost.

One key benefit of hiring a fractional CFO, he points out, is that an in-house CFO’s perspective may only span a single industry, while most fractional CFOs bring a wealth of knowledge about multiple industries, lending depth and breadth to their approach.

What is a “running your business by numbers” approach,and how does it empower businesses?

Profit generation is the primary function of every business, Neumeister says, and its numbers are a foundational element that belongs at the forefront, from operational capacity, revenues, and expenses to assets and liabilities. Implementing a numbers approach provides real-time meaningful financial information, allowing for the exploration of multiple business opportunities, he notes. Moreover, it lends a better understanding of entity structure and insights into the best ways to set up a business.

How did CryptoTax International come about?

“We started getting inquiries from our clients about crypto reporting and its tax implications around 2017, when crypto space was on the cusp of becoming mainstream,” Neumeister shares. Seeing such demand, his team did their due diligence and found out that crypto exchanges were often either clueless or inaccurate with their reporting.

“We understood the market gap and learned crypto tax implications; fast forward to now, it’s our area of expertise,” he recalls. Today,  CryptoTax International offers the first piece of software backed by accountants, CPAs and forensic tax experts specifically to calculate crypto taxes, with an eye toward defending people in cryptocurrency audits.  Soon, his partner Abhinav Soomaney will release a book filled with expert insights on crypto, called ‘Cryptocurrency in a Nutshell: Unlocking the Decentralized.’

What are some myths about crypto reporting?

One of the most common myths, Neumeister notes, is that trading coins for coins doesn't have tax implications until they’re cashed out. He says this misconception persists even after the IRS made it clear that it’s untrue, and points out another misbelief that staked rewards aren’t taxable unless they’re claimed or cashed. The reality, he says, is that if you earned it, it’s taxable, even if you don’t transfer it. Believing myths can lead to audit notices, he warns, but notes that there’s nothing to fear if you have a good team to help you deal with it.

Tell us about your upcoming Forensic Filings podcast.

Throughout his decades of forensic accounting, Neumeister says he’s realized how many financial issues could be avoided if people had better insights into their numbers, internal controls, and how to run their businesses. So, his podcast aims to address those topics.

“Through Forensic Filings,” he shares, “I’ll share insights from a forensic perspective on common business things, ranging from bookkeeping to cash flows.”

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:36:00+00:00,Free Consultations Offered By Omaha Outdoor Lighting Company,"Omaha, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Omaha, Nebraska -

Blingle! of Omaha, NE is pleased to offer their community a free consultation for their next outdoor lighting solution. Whether a project is intended for functional, aesthetic or festive purposes, the company can design and implement a comprehensive, safe solution that will leave customers satisfied with the result and proud of the impact it has on their home or business.

According to the company, many may hesitate to speak with a contractor based solely on the impression that their services are outside their budget. While this is undoubtedly true for truly expansive projects, customers will find that a range of solutions are offered by the company, and customization can bring prices down even further in the right circumstances. In other words, the only way they can know for sure whether their plans are too expensive is to speak with an expert — and they can now do so without incurring any additional charge or obligation. Furthermore, given the company offers a firm No Lights Out Guarantee, customers can always be sure that their installation will be well worth the investment.

Homeowners, for instance, often want landscape and patio lighting that complements the layout of their property as well as the dominating features of their home’s architecture. Blingle! of Omaha and their team of experts are fully capable of analyzing a property in order to identify opportunities for distinct and creative (yet highly practical) lighting that brings it all to life in one complete tableau (or more, as the customer desires). The company utilizes only the safest, highest quality, commercial grade products in all their work, and this means using exterior lights that are capable of withstanding the harshest elements a location could expect.

The design consultation is only the first step of the multi-stage process defined by the company. The data they collect will be transformed into a digital representation on which they will superimpose the proposed lighting setup. In the second stage, the team will use the customer’s feedback to create a computer-based lighting demo in which the designs can be edited to ensure precise implementation. This will be followed by a written proposal (which includes price estimates and required services) that will be presented to the customer for review. Should they wish, they can immediately proceed to drawing up a contract and scheduling the installation.

One aspect that sets Blingle! apart from other contractors is the fact that their team is always willing to lend a hand to their community. With their customers, this tends to mean that they will go above and beyond to make sure installations and other projects are executed exactly as the customer wishes, and any unforeseen obstacles not strictly covered in their initial agreements may be taken care of as a matter of course. In general, however, the team takes every opportunity to lend their skill and expertise where necessary.

“I was at the Omaha Home Show this weekend,” says a customer on the company’s Google profile, “and needing some help with a dirty job that required a lot of bending and picking up. I asked the three young men representing your company if they could help me, and without missing a beat, the three of them pitched in and had it done within 10 minutes. Thank you, Dana, Wes and Ben for your help!”

Others who have utilized the company’s primary services also have high praise to share. Jeremy Z. shares that his experience with the company began with one of their representatives coming out to see the property and offer a quote. “He was great at hearing what we wanted and recommended some things for us,” the review says. “Everything turned out great and looked great. We didn't have any problems with any of the lights, and we live on top of a hill, so it's pretty windy all the time in the winter. They came out and took everything down in January. Very happy with everything and will definitely be using them this Xmas season!” The company boasts a top rating on multiple platforms, an excellent sign of their consistently superior service.

Customers may contact the Omaha outdoor lighting company at their earliest convenience to request their free consultation. The company can be reached via the contact portal on their website or via phone and email. Alternatively, customers may connect with Blingle! on social media to stay up to date with their latest news and offers.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:35:09+00:00,"Accolade (ACCD) Reports Q1 Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates","Accolade (ACCD) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.40 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.73. This compares to loss of $0.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 45.21%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.23 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.27, delivering a surprise of -17.39%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.

Accolade , which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $85.53 million for the quarter ended May 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.80%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $59.53 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Accolade shares have lost about 69.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -19.9%.

What's Next for Accolade?

While Accolade has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Story continues

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Accolade: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.65 on $84.56 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$2.46 on $355.75 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry, IQVIA Holdings (IQV), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2022.

This clinical testing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

IQVIA Holdings' revenues are expected to be $3.5 billion, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity’s management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity’s financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include COVID-19 related impacts; competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses; and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.

For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2022, and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, such as COVID-19, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:34:11+00:00,"RPT-UPDATE 4-US FDA wants COVID boosters targeting Omicron BA.4, BA.5 subvariants","(Repeats to more clients, no changes to text)

By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra

June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers change the design of their booster shots beginning this fall to include components tailored to combat the currently dominant Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the coronavirus.

If authorized, the changes would mark the first major retooling of COVID vaccines, but also could slow their rollout as the FDA has recommended a design somewhat different from what the companies had already tested and started producing.

The FDA will not require new studies testing the BA.4/BA.5 shots in humans to be completed for authorization, a top agency official told Reuters, similar to how annual changes to flu vaccines are handled.

""In a sense, we are chasing the virus, just as we do with influenza, and how close we can get to the variants that are prominent at the time, we'll have to wait and see,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, adding that redesigned vaccines could provide better protection than current ones.

The FDA said companies would not need to change the vaccine for the primary vaccination series, saying the coming year will be ""a transitional period when this modified booster vaccine may be introduced.""

The new booster shots would be bivalent vaccines, targeting both the original virus as well as the Omicron subvariants.

The decision follows a recommendation by the agency's outside advisers to change the vaccine design this fall to combat more prevalent versions of the coronavirus.

BA.4 and BA.5 are estimated to account for more than 50% of U.S. infections, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and have also become dominant elsewhere.

The FDA said on Thursday that it hoped the modified vaccines could be used in early to mid-fall.

Story continues

Scientists have suggested redesigned boosters could spur a broader range of immune responses that might also protect against future variants that may emerge.

""Predicting the future with COVID-19 in particular is hazardous, because COVID has faked us out on a number of occasions,"" Schaffner said.

DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

Regulators from other countries are seriously considering using new boosters based on the BA.1 Omicron variant that caused the massive surge in cases last winter, top FDA official Dr. Peter Marks said in an interview.

""Some may want a vaccine more rapidly. That (vaccine) is going to be available more rapidly,"" Marks said, after a meeting of international regulators on Thursday.

Advisers to the World Health Organization preferred BA.1-based boosters, arguing that the variant is more distinct and could generate a broader response than the more recently circulating subvariants.

Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc have been testing versions of their vaccines modified to combat the BA.1 Omicron variant.

Although they have said those vaccines generated a good immune response against BA.1 and the more recently circulating variants, they did see a lower response against BA.4 and BA.5.

The companies had already been manufacturing their BA.1 vaccines, and said on Tuesday switching to a BA.4/BA.5 design could delay their introduction.

Pfizer/BioNTech, which on Wednesday announced a $3.2 billion contract to supply more COVID vaccine doses to the United States, said they would have a substantial amount of BA.4/BA.5 vaccine ready for distribution by the first week of October.

Moderna said it would be late October or early November before its modified vaccine is ready.

The FDA has directed manufacturers to launch clinical trials to study the BA.4/5 vaccines, but said they would evaluate data on their previous BA.1-based vaccines to support authorization of the retooled shots.

Marks said data from the new trial will be important to gauge the continued effectiveness of the boosters against new variants that may arise.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:34:00+00:00,Titan Kicks Off its 2022 'Flags Over Harvest' Campaign to Help American Farmers,"$5 will be donated to Farm Rescue for each flag requested

QUINCY, Ill., June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Titan International, Inc. (Titan) is excited to kick off its second annual ""Flags Over Harvest"" campaign to support American farmers and their commitment to buying American-made Titan and Goodyear® Farm Tires. Building on the success of last year's campaign, Titan will again be giving away a free American flag for farmers to display on their equipment during harvest season. For each flag requested, Titan will donate $5 to Farm Rescue — a nonprofit organization that plants and harvests crops free of charge for family farmers who have suffered a major illness, injury or natural disaster.

""Agriculture is at the heart of who we are at Titan,"" said Paul Reitz, Titan President and CEO. ""As the only farm tire and wheel company headquartered in the U.S., we feel a special connection to farmers and appreciate their decision to buy American-made tires because it supports thousands of U.S. jobs to keep the nation running. By partnering with Farm Rescue again, we look forward to raising more money to assist farmers in need.""

Last year, Titan raised $4,500 for Farm Rescue as part of its inaugural ""Flags Over Harvest"" campaign and has a goal to raise more funds this year. Titan's history with the ""Flags Over Harvest"" campaign includes donating to Farm Rescue in 2019 to assist farmers affected by major spring floods in the Midwest and in 2020 to help farmers dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. We will also be partnering with them at the Farm Progress Show, Husker Harvest Days and the Iowa State Fair.

""Farm Rescue is honored to be a recipient of the 'Flags Over Harvest' campaign once again this year,"" said Bill Gross, Founder and President of Farm Rescue. ""Last year's funds helped give farm families a chance to continue their livelihood.  In 2021, Farm Rescue and its army of volunteers were honored to extend a helping hand to 121 families across our 7-state service territory. We look forward to continuing our partnership with Titan International, Inc. with the goal of helping America's farm families in times of crisis.""

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:30:00+00:00,BGC Partners Updates its Outlook for the Second Quarter of 2022,"NEW YORK, June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- BGC Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq: BGCP) (""BGC Partners"" or ""BGC"" or the ""Company""), a leading global brokerage and financial technology company, today announced that it has updated its outlook for the quarter ending June 30, 2022.

Updated Outlook BGC's revenue for the second quarter of 2022 is now expected to be slightly below the midpoint of the range of its previously stated outlook, while pre-tax Adjusted Earnings is expected to be around the midpoint. BGC's expected second quarter 2022 revenue would have been higher than the previously stated midpoint and in-line with the year ago period, excluding Insurance, if not for the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar during the period.

The Company's outlook was contained in BGC's financial results press release issued on May 2, 2022, which can be found at http://ir.bgcpartners.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This document contains non-GAAP financial measures that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (""GAAP""). Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company include ""Adjusted Earnings before noncontrolling interests and taxes"", which is used interchangeably with ""pre-tax Adjusted Earnings""; ""Post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders"", which is used interchangeably with ""post-tax Adjusted Earnings""; ""Adjusted EBITDA""; and ""Liquidity"". The definitions of these terms are below.

Adjusted Earnings Defined BGC uses non-GAAP financial measures, including ""Adjusted Earnings before noncontrolling interests and taxes"" and ""Post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders"", which are supplemental measures of operating results used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. BGC believes that Adjusted Earnings best reflect the operating earnings generated by the Company on a consolidated basis and are the earnings which management considers when managing its business.

Story continues

As compared with ""Income (loss) from operations before income taxes"" and ""Net income (loss) for fully diluted shares"", both prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted Earnings calculations primarily exclude certain non-cash items and other expenses that generally do not involve the receipt or outlay of cash by the Company and/or which do not dilute existing stockholders. In addition, Adjusted Earnings calculations exclude certain gains and charges that management believes do not best reflect the ordinary results of BGC. Adjusted Earnings is calculated by taking the most comparable GAAP measures and adjusting for certain items with respect to compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, and other income, as discussed below.

Treatment of Equity-Based Compensation Line Item for Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA The Company's Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA measures exclude all GAAP charges included in the line item ""Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs"" (or ""equity-based compensation"" for purposes of defining the Company's non-GAAP results) as recorded on the Company's GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations and GAAP Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These GAAP equity-based compensation charges reflect the following items:

Charges with respect to grants of exchangeability, which reflect the right of holders of limited partnership units with no capital accounts, such as LPUs and PSUs, to exchange these units into shares of common stock, or into partnership units with capital accounts, such as HDUs, as well as cash paid with respect to taxes withheld or expected to be owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. The withholding taxes related to the exchange of certain non-exchangeable units without a capital account into either common shares or units with a capital account may be funded by the redemption of preferred units such as PPSUs. Charges with respect to preferred units. Any preferred units would not be included in the Company's fully diluted share count because they cannot be made exchangeable into shares of common stock and are entitled only to a fixed distribution. Preferred units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units that may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of common stock at ratios designed to cover any withholding taxes expected to be paid. This is an alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares, to pay applicable withholding taxes. GAAP equity-based compensation charges with respect to the grant of an offsetting amount of common stock or partnership units with capital accounts in connection with the redemption of non-exchangeable units, including PSUs and LPUs. Charges related to amortization of RSUs and limited partnership units. Charges related to grants of equity awards, including common stock or partnership units with capital accounts. Allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs. Such allocations represent the pro-rata portion of post-tax GAAP earnings available to such unit holders.

The amounts of certain quarterly equity-based compensation charges are based upon the Company's estimate of such expected charges during the annual period, as described further below under ""Methodology for Calculating Adjusted Earnings Taxes.""

Virtually all of BGC's key executives and producers have equity or partnership stakes in the Company and its subsidiaries and generally receive deferred equity or limited partnership units as part of their compensation. A significant percentage of BGC's fully diluted shares are owned by its executives, partners and employees. The Company issues limited partnership units as well as other forms of equity-based compensation, including grants of exchangeability into shares of common stock, to provide liquidity to its employees, to align the interests of its employees and management with those of common stockholders, to help motivate and retain key employees, and to encourage a collaborative culture that drives cross-selling and revenue growth.

All share equivalents that are part of the Company's equity-based compensation program, including REUs, PSUs, LPUs, HDUs, and other units that may be made exchangeable into common stock, as well as RSUs (which are recorded using the treasury stock method), are included in the fully diluted share count when issued or at the beginning of the subsequent quarter after the date of grant. Generally, limited partnership units other than preferred units are expected to be paid a pro-rata distribution based on BGC's calculation of Adjusted Earnings per fully diluted share. However, out of an abundance of caution and in order to strengthen the Company's balance sheet due the uncertain macroeconomic conditions with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, BGC Holdings, L.P. has reduced its distributions of income from the operations of BGC's businesses to its partners.

Compensation charges are also adjusted for certain other cash and non-cash items, including those related to the amortization of GFI employee forgivable loans granted prior to the closing of the January 11, 2016 back-end merger with GFI.

Certain Other Compensation-Related Adjustments for Adjusted Earnings BGC also excludes various other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company's underlying performance in a given period from its calculation of Adjusted Earnings. These may include compensation-related items with respect to cost-saving initiatives, such as severance charges incurred in connection with headcount reductions as part of broad restructuring and/or cost savings plans.

Calculation of Non-Compensation Adjustments for Adjusted Earnings Adjusted Earnings calculations may also exclude items such as:

Non-cash GAAP charges related to the amortization of intangibles with respect to acquisitions; Acquisition related costs; Certain rent charges; Non-cash GAAP asset impairment charges; and Various other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company's underlying performance in a given period, including non-compensation-related charges incurred as part of broad restructuring and/or cost savings plans. Such GAAP items may include charges for exiting leases and/or other long-term contracts as part of cost-saving initiatives, as well as non-cash impairment charges related to assets, goodwill and/or intangibles created from acquisitions.

Calculation of Adjustments for Other (income) losses for Adjusted Earnings Adjusted Earnings calculations also exclude certain other non-cash, non-dilutive, and/or non-economic items, which may, in some periods, include:

Gains or losses on divestitures; Fair value adjustment of investments; Certain other GAAP items, including gains or losses related to BGC's investments accounted for under the equity method; and Any unusual, one-time, non-ordinary, or non-recurring gains or losses.

Methodology for Calculating Adjusted Earnings Taxes Although Adjusted Earnings are calculated on a pre-tax basis, BGC also reports post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders. The Company defines post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders as pre-tax Adjusted Earnings reduced by the non-GAAP tax provision described below and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest for Adjusted Earnings.

The Company calculates its tax provision for post-tax Adjusted Earnings using an annual estimate similar to how it accounts for its income tax provision under GAAP. To calculate the quarterly tax provision under GAAP, BGC estimates its full fiscal year GAAP income (loss) from operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and the expected inclusions and deductions for income tax purposes, including expected equity-based compensation during the annual period. The resulting annualized tax rate is applied to BGC's quarterly GAAP income (loss) from operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. At the end of the annual period, the Company updates its estimate to reflect the actual tax amounts owed for the period.

To determine the non-GAAP tax provision, BGC first adjusts pre-tax Adjusted Earnings by recognizing any, and only, amounts for which a tax deduction applies under applicable law. The amounts include charges with respect to equity-based compensation; certain charges related to employee loan forgiveness; certain net operating loss carryforwards when taken for statutory purposes; and certain charges related to tax goodwill amortization. These adjustments may also reflect timing and measurement differences, including treatment of employee loans; changes in the value of units between the dates of grants of exchangeability and the date of actual unit exchange; variations in the value of certain deferred tax assets; and liabilities and the different timing of permitted deductions for tax under GAAP and statutory tax requirements.

After application of these adjustments, the result is the Company's taxable income for its pre-tax Adjusted Earnings, to which BGC then applies the statutory tax rates to determine its non-GAAP tax provision. BGC views the effective tax rate on pre-tax Adjusted Earnings as equal to the amount of its non-GAAP tax provision divided by the amount of pre-tax Adjusted Earnings.

Generally, the most significant factor affecting this non-GAAP tax provision is the amount of charges relating to equity-based compensation. Because the charges relating to equity-based compensation are deductible in accordance with applicable tax laws, increases in such charges have the effect of lowering the Company's non-GAAP effective tax rate and thereby increasing its post-tax Adjusted Earnings.

BGC incurs income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of its subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (""UBT"") in New York City. Any U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the unit holders rather than with the partnership entity. The Company's consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., BGC is expected to operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes. For these reasons, taxes for Adjusted Earnings are expected to be presented to show the tax provision the consolidated Company would expect to pay if 100 percent of earnings were taxed at global corporate rates.

Calculations of Pre- and Post-Tax Adjusted Earnings per Share BGC's pre- and post-tax Adjusted Earnings per share calculations assume either that:

The fully diluted share count includes the shares related to any dilutive instruments, but excludes the associated expense, net of tax, when the impact would be dilutive; or The fully diluted share count excludes the shares related to these instruments, but includes the associated expense, net of tax.

The share count for Adjusted Earnings excludes certain shares and share equivalents expected to be issued in future periods but not yet eligible to receive dividends and/or distributions. Each quarter, the dividend payable to BGC's stockholders, if any, is expected to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors with reference to a number of factors, including post-tax Adjusted Earnings per share. BGC may also pay a pro-rata distribution of net income to limited partnership units, as well as to Cantor for its noncontrolling interest. The amount of this net income, and therefore of these payments per unit, would be determined using the above definition of Adjusted Earnings per share on a pre-tax basis.

The declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by the Company will be at the discretion of its Board of Directors using the fully diluted share count. For more information on any share count adjustments, see the table titled ""Fully Diluted Weighted-Average Share Count under GAAP and for Adjusted Earnings"" in the Company's most recent financial results press release.

Management Rationale for Using Adjusted Earnings BGC's calculation of Adjusted Earnings excludes the items discussed above because they are either non-cash in nature, because the anticipated benefits from the expenditures are not expected to be fully realized until future periods, or because the Company views results excluding these items as a better reflection of the underlying performance of BGC's ongoing operations. Management uses Adjusted Earnings in part to help it evaluate, among other things, the overall performance of the Company's business, to make decisions with respect to the Company's operations, and to determine the amount of dividends payable to common stockholders and distributions payable to holders of limited partnership units. Dividends payable to common stockholders and distributions payable to holders of limited partnership units are included within ""Dividends to stockholders"" and ""Earnings distributions to limited partnership interests and noncontrolling interests,"" respectively, in our unaudited, condensed, consolidated statements of cash flows.

The term ""Adjusted Earnings"" should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). The Company views Adjusted Earnings as a metric that is not indicative of liquidity, or the cash available to fund its operations, but rather as a performance measure. Pre- and post-tax Adjusted Earnings, as well as related measures, are not intended to replace the Company's presentation of its GAAP financial results. However, management believes that these measures help provide investors with a clearer understanding of BGC's financial performance and offer useful information to both management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the GAAP and Adjusted Earnings measures of financial performance should be considered together.

For more information regarding Adjusted Earnings, see the sections in the Company's most recent financial results press release titled ""Reconciliation of GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations before Income Taxes to Adjusted Earnings and GAAP Fully Diluted EPS to Post-Tax Adjusted EPS"", including the related footnotes, for details about how BGC's non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA Defined BGC also provides an additional non-GAAP financial performance measure, ""Adjusted EBITDA"", which it defines as GAAP ""Net income (loss) available to common stockholders"", adjusted to add back the following items:

Provision (benefit) for income taxes; Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries; Interest expense; Fixed asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization; Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs; Impairment of long-lived assets; (Gains) losses on equity method investments; and Certain other non-cash GAAP items, such as non-cash charges of amortized rents incurred by the Company for its new U.K. based headquarters.

The Company's management believes that its Adjusted EBITDA measure is useful in evaluating BGC's operating performance, because the calculation of this measure generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, the Company's management uses this measure to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. BGC believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of the Company's financial results and operations.

Since BGC's Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, investors should use this measure in addition to GAAP measures of net income when analyzing BGC's operating performance. Because not all companies use identical EBITDA calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow or GAAP cash flow from operations because the Company's Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain cash requirements, such as tax and debt service payments.

For more information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, see the section in the Company's most recent financial results press release titled ""Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA"", including the footnotes to the same, for details about how BGC's non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP.

Timing of Outlook for Certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Items BGC anticipates providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP revenues and for certain non-GAAP measures from time to time. However, the Company does not anticipate providing an outlook for other GAAP results. This is because certain GAAP items, which are excluded from Adjusted Earnings and/or Adjusted EBITDA, are difficult to forecast with precision before the end of each period. The Company therefore believes that it is not possible for it to have the required information necessary to forecast GAAP results or to quantitatively reconcile GAAP forecasts to non-GAAP forecasts with sufficient precision without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The relevant items that are difficult to predict on a quarterly and/or annual basis with precision and may materially impact the Company's GAAP results include, but are not limited, to the following:

Certain equity-based compensation charges that may be determined at the discretion of management throughout and up to the period-end; Unusual, one-time, non-ordinary, or non-recurring items; The impact of gains or losses on certain marketable securities, as well as any gains or losses related to associated mark-to- market movements and/or hedging. These items are calculated using period-end closing prices; Non-cash asset impairment charges, which are calculated and analyzed based on the period-end values of the underlying assets. These amounts may not be known until after period-end; and Acquisitions, dispositions and/or resolutions of litigation, which are fluid and unpredictable in nature.

Liquidity Defined BGC may also use a non-GAAP measure called ""liquidity"". The Company considers liquidity to be comprised of the sum of cash and cash equivalents, reverse repurchase agreements (if any), securities owned, and marketable securities, less securities lent out in securities loaned transactions and repurchase agreements (if any). The Company considers liquidity to be an important metric for determining the amount of cash that is available or that could be readily available to the Company on short notice.

For more information regarding Liquidity, see the section in the Company's most recent financial results press release titled ""Liquidity Analysis"", including any footnotes to the same, for details about how BGC's non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:25:09+00:00,Micron (MU) Q3 Earnings Top Estimates,"Micron (MU) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.59 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $1.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.14, delivering a surprise of 9.74%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Micron , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, posted revenues of $8.64 billion for the quarter ended May 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.42 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Micron shares have lost about 39.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -19.9%.

What's Next for Micron?

While Micron has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Story continues

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Micron: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.71 on $9.29 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.47 on $33.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor Memory is currently in the bottom 4% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

LeGrand SA (LGRVF), another stock in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2022.

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

LeGrand SA's revenues are expected to be $2.1 billion, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.

The Federal Communications Commission announced the decision in an order published Thursday, which said it also granted permission for the service to mobile customers of Kepler Communications Inc.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name of Musk’s closely held company, has launched about 2,500 first-generation satellites in its Starlink fleet and serves almost 500,000 subscribers worldwide.

Customers get Starlink signals from space through small dishes that can be mounted on their homes or businesses. It’s designed to serve remote and rural areas. SpaceX said its mobile gear would be much the same, although it would include extra sensors and mountings for use with trucks, recreational vehicles, boats and aircraft.

The FCC said it received requests to deny or defer the new SpaceX service from Viasat Inc., Dish Network Corp. and RS Access LLC. Viasat has objected to SpaceX’s Starlink, saying it raises the risk of in-space collisions, while Dish and billionaire Michael Dell’s RS Access are embroiled in a dispute with SpaceX over airwaves use.

In the face of significant economic, social and health-related challenges around the world, corporate sustainability has never been more important.

Our 2030 Sustainability Plan puts our central purpose of helping people live better, healthier lives at the forefront. We’re laying the foundation for transforming our business over the next decade, advancing healthcare while remaining responsive to the pressing issues of today. By innovating for greater access and affordability and breaking down barriers to care, we intend to improve the lives of one in every three people on the planet – that's 3 billion people – every year by 2030.

With the release of Abbott’s 2021 Global Sustainability Report, the company highlights its progress over the past year, reaching 2.2 billion people through its products and services.

Check out key 2021 highlights below, and for a deep dive, read the full Global Sustainability Report.

Innovating for access and affordability is key to our global sustainability plan. We’ve prioritized this by creating core design principles that will guide Abbott’s product innovation moving forward — embedding access and affordability into how technologies are developed and brought to the people who need them. Looking ahead, Abbott will track its progress in extending the reach of its innovation in key areas of impact, including reaching more people, transforming standards of care, improving health outcomes, delivering cost savings and strengthening infrastructure. Developing new technologies and advancing existing ones that connect people with the care they need. This includes technology like:

Next-generation continuous glucose monitoring provided by Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre 3 system, recently cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The size of just two stacked U.S. pennies, the FreeStyle Libre 3 system features the world’s smallest, thinnest1 and most accurate2 14-day glucose sensor on the market – for the same price as the FreeStyle Libre 2 system. NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, first-of-its-kind technology in the U.S. that allows people to visit remotely with their doctor and adjust their devices for pain and movement disorders directly through an app. i-STAT Alinity TBI Plasma test, the first rapid portable blood test for concussions, which can provide results within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted. This test could help eliminate wait time in the emergency room and could reduce the number of unnecessary, costly CT scans by up to 40%. Ensuring product quality by making products and services as if they’re for family. This commitment was at the forefront of our decision earlier this year to recall infant formula products made at one of our plants, which regrettably worsened an industry-wide shortage in the U.S. Our priority is doing everything we can to get infants and families the high-quality formula they need, and we’re sharing updates on its progress. Find more details here. Advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) throughout Abbott, with 44.6% of STEM-related positions and 40% of global management roles at the company now filled by women. Abbott also promoted DEI across the broader healthcare industry through an initiative with LISC to build a more diverse supply chain and a new program to make clinical trials more diverse. Transforming care for malnutrition and infectious diseases by establishing the Abbott Center for Malnutrition Solutions, distributing 1 billion COVID-19 tests across the globe in 2021 and launching the Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition to help the world stay one step ahead of the next viral threat. Building a stronger, more sustainable Abbott across every part of the company, including:

Workforce: To continually create lifesaving solutions, we’re empowering our teams with skills to meet the health needs of tomorrow. Abbott provides a supportive, inclusive culture, and programs that help ensure employees’ continued development and that encourage them to build successful careers. One example in 2021: more than 17,000 Abbott employees completed a comprehensive leadership training program called Leading With Impact. Another program, called Freedom 2 Save, supported the financial security of employees by helping those with college debt save for retirement. Since launch in 2018, Abbott has provided $3.5 million in savings contributions to participating employees’ retirement accounts. Environment:

Achieved 5% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions (compared to 2018 levels) and committed to a science-based target to further reduce global carbon emissions. Laid groundwork for future water stewardship certification and management practice accreditation, including launching a new initiative in Spain to protect local water sources. Minimized packaging and waste across Abbott’s operations and products, with eight new Abbott sites certified for sending zero waste to landfill – bringing the company’s total to 46 sites to date. Data: Data and technology hold the key to transforming healthcare, and Abbott is committed to realizing this potential while protecting the information people share with us. We develop our products, processes and internal systems securely, embedding data-safety considerations in everything we do. And we created and published an enhanced public commitment to patient privacy and protecting sensitive data

The Gatorade Player of the Year Selection Committee, which leverages experts including coaches, scouts, media and others to evaluate candidates, selected Jackson from nearly half a million other student-athletes who play girls soccer nationwide.

Competition for the national award was fierce. Jackson topped the list of state winners in girls soccer who collectively boast an incredible list of accomplishments, including 22 First Team All-State selections, 7 returning state Gatorade Players of the Year and 38 who are committed to play at Division I colleges/universities.

""Riley Jackson is that rare player who can influence the outcome of the game without showing up on the scoresheet,"" said J.R. Eskilson, a national soccer analyst for Prepsoccer.com. ""She's one of the best passers in high school soccer, identifying through-ball channels that few players can envision, and she has the skill to put those passes into tight windows. She also has the elegance on the ball to make everything look effortless, but there is so much sophistication in how she approaches the game. That's what really makes her great. What's more, she's a wall defensively, and dictates where the game is played on the pitch with her challenges and instincts for stepping in front of passes. Jackson had one of the best seasons in high school soccer history by making her teammates better, and that's part of what makes her worthy of being the Gatorade National Player of the Year.""

The 5-foot-8 sophomore midfielder scored 14 goals and passed for 18 assists this past season, leading the Titans (19-2-1) to the Class AAAAA state semifinals. Jackson missed the high school postseason while she was leading the U.S. Soccer Under-17 Women's National Team to the championship at the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying tournament. Jackson was the Golden Ball winner, awarded to the tournament's best player. Also the Class AAAAA State Player of the Year, she concluded her sophomore year with 36 goals and 48 assists in her prep soccer career.

Jackson has volunteered locally as a youth soccer instructor and camp coach and she's also a USSF certified, paid soccer referee.

Jackson has maintained a weighted 4.26 GPA in the classroom. She will begin her junior year of high school this fall.

""Riley Jackson is now a part of an elite alumni group of past Gatorade Players of the Year, including athletic icons such as Peyton Manning and Abby Wambach,"" said Gatorade Senior Vice President and General Manager Brett O'Brien. ""She has proven why her name belongs on the trophy and we have no doubt Riley will go on to accomplish great things in and out of sport like so many POY winners before her.""

Each year, a selection committee evaluates the nation's top talent to choose one state winner from each of the 50 states as well as Washington D.C., in 12 different sports: football, girls volleyball, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls basketball, baseball, softball, boys and girls soccer, and boys and girls track & field. In all, 608 athletes are honored each year. From the pool of state winners, one national winner is selected in each of the 12 sports.

Gatorade has a long-standing history of serving athlete communities and understands how sports instill valuable lifelong skills on and off the field. Since the program's inception in 1985, Gatorade Player of the Year award recipients have won hundreds of professional and college championships, and many have also turned into pillars in their communities, becoming coaches, business owners and educators. Previous winners include a distinguished list of athletes, such as Peyton Manning, Abby Wambach, Jayson Tatum, Elena Delle Donne and many other sports icons.

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:16:06+00:00,GRAPHIC-S&amp;P 500 ends brutal first half '22 with largest percentage loss since 1970,"(Updates headline, text, prices, charts to reflect closing prices)

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed

NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Steep losses in stocks and bonds, dizzying market swings and a Federal Reserve intent on curbing the worst inflation in more than forty years have been among the hallmarks of U.S. markets in the first half of 2022.

The S&P 500 finished the initial six months of 2022 with a 20.6% loss, shedding some $8.5 trillion in market value as the index logged its steepest first-half decline since 1970.

The index earlier this month confirmed the common definition of a bear market by closing down over 20% from its January record peak.

Bonds have fared little better, with the ICE BofA Treasury Index down about 10% this year, on pace for its worst year in the index's history going back to 1997.

For now, investors see little respite from the gyrations that have pummeled markets over the last several months amid worries that the Fed’s fight against inflation will further dry up risk appetite while potentially throwing the U.S. economy into recession.

The coming month will bring a fresh round of corporate earnings, the latest inflation data and culminate in a Fed meeting, leaving plenty of opportunities for markets to build on a nascent rally in stocks that began in mid-June or seek out fresh lows.

Soaring inflation forced the Fed to quickly raise rates in the first half of the year, throwing into reverse the easy monetary policy that helped the S&P 500 more than double from its March 2020 lows.

The index’s slide has pummeled many of the high-growth shares that prospered in recent years. One high profile casualty has been Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, which holds post-pandemic favorites such as Zoom Video Communications , Teladoc Health Inc and Roku Inc, is down about 58% year-to-date.

The tumble in equities has also severely tested the popular strategy of buying stocks on weakness, which rewarded investors for the better part of the last decade but has floundered this year amid the S&P’s decline. The benchmark index has seen three rebounds of at least 6% this year that have reversed to fall below its prior low point. The latest bounce has the index up about 3% since its mid-June low.

Story continues

Another popular approach that has suffered this year is the so-called 60/40 portfolio, where investors count on a blend of stocks and bonds to protect against market declines, with equities rising amid economic optimism and bonds strengthening during turbulent times.

That strategy has gone awry in 2022 as expectations of a hawkish Fed weighed on both asset classes. The BlackRock 60/40 Target Allocation fund is down about 16% since the start of the year, its worst performance since it launched in 2006.

The first half of the year saw volatility return to global financial markets in spectacular fashion, with stocks, bonds and currencies all jolted by central bank moves as well as surging geopolitical tensions.

But while the Cboe Volatility Index, or ""Wall Street fear gauge,"" has remained elevated through the year to date, it has failed to close higher than the 37, the average level that marked past market bottoms. That has led some investors to fret that the selling might not be done.

Few believe the wild swings in markets will subside until there is evidence that inflation is cooling, allowing the Fed to slow or halt its monetary policy tightening. For now, warnings of a looming recession have grown louder on Wall Street, as the effects of higher rates seep into the economy.

The Citigroup U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which tracks where a core set of economic data series has been coming in relative to expectations, shows incoming data missing estimates by the largest margin in about two years.

Stocks fell again on Wall Street Thursday, closing out the worst quarter for the market since the onset of the COVID pandemic in early 2020.

The S&P 500 index lost 0.9%. It’s now down 21% since hitting a record high at the beginning of the year, having entered a bear market earlier in June. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% and the Nasdaq fell 1.3%.

Tech stocks and retailers and other companies that rely directly on consumer spending posted some of the biggest losses, as they have all year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which helps set mortgage rates, fell to 3.01%.

The benchmark index has been on a dismal streak that dragged it into a bear market earlier this month and is now down 20% for the year. The second quarter is on track to be its worst since the beginning of 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 254 points to 30,775 and the Nasdaq fell 149 points to 11,028. Small-company stocks also fell. The Russell 2000 lost 0.4%.

Technology companies were among the biggest weights on the market as investors continued to favor utilities and other traditional defensive stocks. Apple fell 1.8%, while Exelon rose 2.2%.

Retailers and other companies that rely directly on consumer spending also posted some of the biggest losses, as they have all year. Amazon slipped 2.5% and Best Buy shed 2.9%.

Rising inflation has been behind much of the slump for the broader market this year as businesses raise prices on everything from food to clothing and consumers are squeezed tighter. Inflation remains stubbornly hot, according to a series of recent economic updates. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have been aggressively raising interest rates to try to slow economic growth in order to cool inflation.

“What the market is trying to assess is when does it seem as if the Fed is going to have what it needs to ascertain that inflation is plateauing,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.

Story continues

A measure of inflation that is closely tracked by the Fed rose 6.3% in May from a year earlier, unchanged from its level in April. Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department also said that consumer spending rose at a sluggish 0.2% rate from April to May.

The update follows a worrisome report earlier this week showing that consumer confidence slipped to its lowest level in 16 months. The government has also reported that the U.S. economy shrank 1.6% in the first quarter, and weak consumer spending was a key part of that contraction.

Investors are worried that the U.S. could slip into a recession as inflation hurts businesses and consumers. A key concern involves the Fed's interest rate hikes, which could slam the brakes on economic growth too much and actually bring on a recession.

The situation has become even more complicated as COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine compounded supply chain problems. The war in Ukraine prompted a surge in oil prices this year that resulted in record high gasoline prices. The OPEC oil cartel and allied producing nations decided Thursday to increase production of crude oil, but the amount will likely do little to relieve high gasoline prices at the pump and energy-fueled inflation plaguing the global economy.

“There’s no doubt this has been a difficult two quarters for the market, the U.S. economy, the U.S. consumer, and for the Fed’s job to control and curtail inflationary pressure,” Krosby said. “And yet, as we get into the beginning of the second half, so far companies have been managing and it's the guidance they offer that is going to help set the tone over the next couple of weeks.”

Wall Street racked up more losses for stocks Thursday as the market closed out its worst quarter since the onset of the COVID pandemic in early 2020.

The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.9%, its fourth consecutive drop. The benchmark index is now down 21% since it hit an all-time high at the beginning of the year. It entered a bear market earlier in June.

All told, the S&P 500′s performance in the first half of 2022 was the worst since the first six months of 1970.

“And in 1970 there was a solid rebound after that first half decline,” said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally Invest. “This time around, the impact of the Fed, the impact of inflation and the uncertainty of where growth goes from here is really weighing on investors’ minds.... We just don’t know when the clouds of uncertainty are going to start to clear.”

The market’s steep decline this year has all but wiped out its gains from 2021, which was a banner year for the market as it emerged from its previous bear market in early 2020.

Rising inflation has been behind much of the slump for the broader market this year as businesses raise prices and consumers are squeezed tighter. Inflation remains stubbornly high, according to a series of recent economic updates.

The Federal Reserve and other central banks have been aggressively raising interest rates to try to slow economic growth to cool inflation. Higher rates can bring down inflation, but they also risk a recession by slowing the economy too much. They also push down prices for stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies and other investments.

“What the market is trying to assess is when does it seem as if the Fed is going to have what it needs to ascertain that inflation is plateauing,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.

The S&P 500 fell 33.45 points to 3,785.38 on Thursday. It lost 16.4% in the April-to-June quarter, its biggest quarterly decline since it slumped 20% in the first three months of 2020, when the pandemic upended the global economy in a matter of weeks.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 253.88 points, or 0.8%, to 30,775.43. The Nasdaq composite slid 149.16 points, or 1.3%, to 11,028.74.

Small-company stocks also fell. The Russell 2000 lost 11.38 points, or 0.7%, to 1,707.99.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set mortgage rates, fell to 3.01% from 3.09% late Wednesday.

FRIDLEY, Minn., June 30, 2022 /3BL Media/ - Cummins Inc.’s Acoustical Technology Center (ATC) at the company’s Power Generation facility in Fridley, Minnesota, is celebrating its 10th anniversary playing a critical role in the delivery of the quietest power generation products on the planet.

The center is the largest of its kind in the world, with a hemi-anechoic chamber that is 105 feet long, 80 feet wide and 36.5 feet high, capable of recording precision-grade acoustical data from 20 Hertz (Hz) to 20,000 Hz – the entire range of human auditory recognition.

Noise emission regulations around the world require power solutions of all shapes and sizes to not exceed certain noise thresholds. To meet those rigorous acoustic requirements, highly scientific and precise testing is essential.

“The ATC is a magnificent house of sound,” said Gary Johansen, Vice President of Engineering for Cummins Power Systems. “We recognized the need for an investment like this and wanted to make sure we had a world-class facility to deliver world-class solutions.”

Prior to the ATC, noise testing was conducted at an outdoor facility but due to harsh weather conditions in Minnesota and uncontrolled climate and outdoor background noise levels, the accuracy of the noise testing was compromised.

The ATC includes patented anechoic wedges that line the interior of the chamber, designed with “metadyne” perforated-metal to achieve a 50 Hz cutoff. The chamber is also equipped with a sophisticated ventilation system that transfers air at a rate of 222,500 cubic feet per minute while maintaining a regulated temperature and humidity level.

“The ATC is also a significant investment for the future,” added Johansen. “Today, we have been testing diesel and natural gas gensets, as well as other industrial equipment. But what we are quickly moving towards is testing hydrogen fuel cells, energy storage systems, and power electronics that control and manage the movement of power between assets and sources; so, in the future we may be testing fewer engines, and more new technologies.”

Story continues

The 10-year anniversary of the Acoustical Technology Center coincides with the launch of Cummins Destination Zero, the company’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Destination Zero and the ATC are both demonstrations of Cummins’ commitment to environmentally safe and sustainable products.

“No challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate. Every day, we’re feeling the impact of climate change, and today’s Supreme Court decision is a major step backward,” former President Barack Obama tweeted.

“This decision marks the second time in a week that the Supreme Court has turned back the clock to darker days that have dangerous implications for public health,” said Mike Bloomberg, UN Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions, and founder of Bloomberg Media.

Gerry Connolly, a Democrat representing Virginia, tweeted, “The Supreme Court has decided that the Clean Air Act does not, in fact, allow the government to facilitate — wait for it — clean air. This is outrageous on its face.”

Others celebrated the Supreme Court decision, including Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Tom Cotton and House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene — all Republicans. Rubio said the decision was “long overdue” message to reign in federal overreach.

“Another big victory for the Supreme Court,” said Greene.

Lithium Ionic is a publicly-traded company which owns a 100% ownership interest in the Itinga lithium project in Brazil (the “Itinga Project” or the “Project”).

The Itinga Project is located in Minas Gerais State (MG), Brazil. The Project comprises five mineral licenses covering more than 1,300 hectares in the prolific Aracuai lithium province. A portion of the Project occurs immediately south of the CBL lithium mine and plant, Brazil’s only lithium producer, and immediately north of the large Barreiro and Xuxa lithium deposits of Sigma Lithium Corp (TSXV: SGML) (NASDAQ: SGML).

The Project area has excellent infrastructure, including access to hydroelectrical grid power, water, a commercial port, highways and communities. Lithium mineralization (spodumene, lepidolite, petalite) occurs within a halo of pegmatite dikes and apophyses that occur within the rocks surrounding Neoproterozoic granitic intrusions. Mineralization within the mineralized province and the distribution of the mineralized pegmatites is controlled by a complex and crosscutting system of northeast and northwest oriented faults that were exploited by the dikes. Mineralized structures have been identified in two areas within the Project and the remainder of the Project area remains to be explored.

CALGARY, Alberta, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shaw Communications Inc. (“Shaw” or the “Company”) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended May 31, 2022. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated revenue decreased by 2.1% to $1.35 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 0.3% to $644 million and net income decreased 42.7% to $203 million. The prior year period included incremental Wireline Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates. On a year-over-year basis, this revenue impact is effectively offset by equity-based compensation adjustments driven by significant fluctuations in Shaw’s share price and adjustments to employee benefits provisions, resulting in no significant impact on EBITDA variances.

In the third quarter, the Company continued to compete for subscribers while balancing profitability and investing in its networks to ensure the customer experience continues to improve. This focus resulted in the continued positive trend in Consumer Internet net additions as well as stronger Wireless additions compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The impacts from COVID-19 continue to subside and customer activity in both Wireline and Wireless is increasing, although have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels.

“Shaw remains deeply committed to the combination with Rogers and our announced agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor marks a critical point in our bold and transformative journey to join together with Rogers. We feel strongly that the sale of Freedom to Quebecor will be seen as a positive outcome by the regulators as Quebecor expands their successful wireless operations through this acquisition. We continue to support the ongoing process and remain optimistic that there is a clear path to obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals in an expeditious manner. The joining together of Rogers and Shaw remains a transformational transaction that will deliver significant benefits to many stakeholders, most importantly, Canadian consumers and businesses, through a strong national network with new and better technologies. I want to acknowledge and thank all the Shaw employees who have not only successfully managed through over two years of COVID-19 disruptions but have also continued to deliver solid results while working diligently in support of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction,” said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair & Chief Executive Officer.

Shaw and Rogers Transaction

On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Rogers Communications Inc. (“Rogers”), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw’s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (“Class A Shares”) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (“Class B Shares”) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the “Rogers-Shaw Transaction”). Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the “Shaw Family Shareholders”)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the “Rogers Shares”) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash.

The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw’s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.

Regulatory Approval Status

On March 24, 2022, the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw’s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On April 27, 2022, the National Pensioners Federation and Public Interest Advocacy Centre (NPF-PIAC) filed a Petition to the federal Cabinet requesting that the CRTC decision approving the change of ownership and effective control of Shaw’s licensed broadcasting assets be set aside or referred back to the CRTC for reconsideration and hearing. On June 22, 2022, Cabinet declined to consider the NPF-PIAC Petition.

The Rogers-Shaw Transaction remains under review by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (“ISED”), as the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry must approve any direct or indirect transfer of Shaw’s spectrum licences. In a public statement on March 3, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry (the “Minister”), Francois-Philippe Champagne, acknowledged the ongoing regulatory reviews of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and that decisions are expected in due course. He also noted that he will not permit “the wholesale transfer of Shaw’s wireless licences to Rogers.”

In accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Rogers and Shaw filed pre-merger notifications pursuant to Part IX of the Competition Act (Canada) in April 2021 to trigger the Competition Bureau’s review of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner of Competition (the “Commissioner”) filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Competition Bureau’s case can be heard by the Tribunal. The Commissioner must ultimately prove his case before the Tribunal in a hearing in order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from being completed.

On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner’s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As a result, there is no need for the Tribunal to hear the Commissioner’s application for an interim injunction. Resolving the interim injunction application allows the parties to focus on addressing the Commissioner’s concerns with the Rogers-Shaw Transaction in an effort to reach a settlement to the litigation.

Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor

On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (“Quebecor”) announced a divestiture agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion (the “Freedom Transaction”), which is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner and ISED, and conditional on: (i) the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction; and (ii) entering into definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor strongly believe the divestiture agreement effectively addresses the concerns raised by the Commissioner and the Minister regarding viable and sustainable wireless competition in Canada.

Under the terms of the divestiture agreement, Quebecor will acquire all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom’s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations. The agreement does not contemplate divestiture of Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements by Shaw and Rogers to provide Quebecor transport services (including backhaul and backbone), roaming services and other services for the provision of Freedom’s mobile wireless network. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom’s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom’s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. The parties are working expeditiously and in good faith to finalize definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date as Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Closing of the Freedom Transaction will occur substantially concurrently with closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

Rogers and Shaw Continue to Work with Regulatory Authorities to Secure the Requisite Regulatory Approvals

Rogers and Shaw continue to engage constructively with the Competition Bureau in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement, which offers the most expeditious path forward to closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and delivering its benefits to Canadians.

While the divestiture agreement with Quebecor provides a basis for advancing settlement negotiations with the Commissioner, Rogers and Shaw are also taking the necessary steps to oppose the Commissioner’s application to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On June 3, 2022, each of Rogers and Shaw filed a written response disputing the basis for the Commissioner’s application, and on June 16, 2022, the Commissioner filed his written reply to these responses. On June 17, 2022, the Tribunal issued an order setting the timeframe for its consideration of the Commissioner’s application. The Tribunal’s scheduling order includes a voluntary mediation process, currently scheduled for July, in which the parties have agreed to participate. Should it be required, the Tribunal hearing of the Commissioner’s application is expected to occur in November and December of this calendar year.

Rogers and Shaw strongly believe the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy, resulting in a combined entity with the capabilities necessary to invest in digital infrastructure, create jobs, drive innovation, increase choice, and bridge the digital divide. In addition, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction will foster greater competition by creating Canada’s most robust wholly-owned national network, and generating more choice for businesses and consumers so they may realize the full economic and social benefits of next generation networks.

As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust agreed to extend the Outside Date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from June 13, 2022 to July 31, 2022 in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement. Subject to receipt of all required approvals and satisfaction of all closing conditions, the parties are working towards closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction on or before July 31, 2022. Nonetheless, the time required for Rogers and Shaw to address the Commissioner’s concerns and agree on the terms of a negotiated settlement with the Commissioner (or any associated litigation, including the Tribunal hearing), as well as ISED approval, and any appeals of the outcomes of these processes, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com and EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2022

In the third quarter, the Company added approximately 35,000 Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 19,400 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition, a limited supply of key devices, bundle adjustments effective in late 2021 for Shaw Mobile and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile plans. Third quarter Wireless revenue increased 4.4% to $311 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 12.2% to $129 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Wireless service revenue grew 8.9% due to continued subscriber growth in both the Freedom and Shaw Mobile brands. Third quarter Wireless ARPU2 decreased a modest 0.2% from the prior year period to $36.86. Wireless postpaid churn3 of 1.10% compared to 1.07% from the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Consumer Wireline RGU4 losses of approximately 19,900 improved over the prior year period, including positive Internet additions of approximately 6,200 primarily due to improved retention tactics and continued investments. Third quarter Wireline revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.9% and 2.3% to $1.04 billion and $515 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The prior year period included incremental Wireline Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the CRTC decision on final aggregated TPIA rates, which was effectively offset by equity-based compensation adjustments due to the significant increase in Shaw’s share price and adjustments to employee benefit provisions both also recorded in the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is not a defined term under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning, and therefore may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies.

Third quarter Wireless revenue increased 4.4% to $311 million and adjusted EBITDA of $129 million increased 12.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue increased 8.9% to $245 million due to an increased subscriber base, while Wireless equipment revenue decreased 9.6% to $66 million as the number of devices sold in the quarter decreased compared to the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA is mainly due to continued service revenue growth as well as the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter.

Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 24,300 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 36,500 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain of approximately 6,200 Consumer Internet additions, offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 19,900 in the aggregate. In Business, positive Internet RGUs were offset by declines in Video and Phone resulting in Business RGUs declining by approximately 4,300.

Third quarter Wireline revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $1.04 billion and $515 million, respectively, decreased 3.9% and 2.3%, respectively, when compared with the prior year. Consumer revenue of $885 million decreased 5.3% compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental Wireline Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the CRTC decision on final aggregated TPIA rates as well as growth in Internet revenue offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $153 million increased 5.5% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.

Free cash flow for the quarter of $217 million decreased 29.3% compared to the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to higher capital expenditures, increased cash taxes and the impact of a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense recorded in the prior year. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of $266 million compared to $233 million in the prior year.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 of $203 million decreased $151 million compared to $354 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to a revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in the prior year, which reduced income tax expense by $125 million and interest expense by $35 million. These decreases in net income were offset by higher adjusted EBITDA compared to a year ago and an $11 million decrease in non-operating costs related to the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

As at the end of May 31, 2022, the Company’s net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.

Non-GAAP and additional financial measures

Certain measures in this MD&A do not have standard meanings prescribed by GAAP and are therefore considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are provided to enhance the reader’s overall understanding of our financial performance or current financial condition. They are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between periods. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and do not have standardized meanings. Therefore, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities.

Please refer to “Non-GAAP and additional financial measures” in this MD&A for a discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and net debt as well as net debt leverage ratio and adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP ratios.

Introduction

At Shaw, we focus on delivering sustainable long-term growth by connecting customers to the world through a seamless connectivity experience. In the third quarter, the Company continued to compete for subscriber growth while balancing profitability and investing in its networks to ensure the customer experience continues to improve.

Shaw and Rogers Transaction

On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Rogers Communications Inc. (“Rogers”), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw’s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (“Class A Shares”) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (“Class B Shares”) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the “Rogers-Shaw Transaction”). Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the “Shaw Family Shareholders”)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the “Rogers Shares”) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash.

The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw’s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.

Regulatory Approval Status

On March 24, 2022, the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw’s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On April 27, 2022, the National Pensioners Federation and Public Interest Advocacy Centre (NPF-PIAC) filed a Petition to the federal Cabinet requesting that the CRTC decision approving the change of ownership and effective control of Shaw’s licensed broadcasting assets be set aside or referred back to the CRTC for reconsideration and hearing. On June 22, 2022, Cabinet declined to consider the NPF-PIAC Petition.

The Rogers-Shaw Transaction remains under review by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (“ISED”), as the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry must approve any direct or indirect transfer of Shaw’s spectrum licences. In a public statement on March 3, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry (the “Minister”), Francois-Philippe Champagne, acknowledged the ongoing regulatory reviews of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and that decisions are expected in due course. He also noted that he will not permit “the wholesale transfer of Shaw’s wireless licences to Rogers.”

In accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Rogers and Shaw filed pre-merger notifications pursuant to Part IX of the Competition Act (Canada) in April 2021 to trigger the Competition Bureau’s review of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner of Competition (the “Commissioner”) filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Competition Bureau’s case can be heard by the Tribunal. The Commissioner must ultimately prove his case before the Tribunal in a hearing in order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from being completed.

On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner’s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As a result, there is no need for the Tribunal to hear the Commissioner’s application for an interim injunction. Resolving the interim injunction application allows the parties to focus on addressing the Commissioner’s concerns with the Rogers-Shaw Transaction in an effort to reach a settlement to the litigation.

Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor

On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (“Quebecor”) announced a divestiture agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion (the “Freedom Transaction”), which is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner and ISED, and conditional on: (i) the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction; and (ii) entering into definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor strongly believe the divestiture agreement effectively addresses the concerns raised by the Commissioner and the Minister regarding viable and sustainable wireless competition in Canada.

Under the terms of the divestiture agreement, Quebecor will acquire all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom’s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations. The agreement does not contemplate divestiture of Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements by Shaw and Rogers to provide Quebecor transport services (including backhaul and backbone), roaming services and other services for the provision of Freedom’s mobile wireless network. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom’s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom’s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. The parties are working expeditiously and in good faith to finalize definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date as Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Closing of the Freedom Transaction will occur substantially concurrently with closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

Rogers and Shaw Continue to Work with Regulatory Authorities to Secure the Requisite Regulatory Approvals

Rogers and Shaw continue to engage constructively with the Competition Bureau in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement, which offers the most expeditious path forward to closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and delivering its benefits to Canadians.

While the divestiture agreement with Quebecor provides a basis for advancing settlement negotiations with the Commissioner, Rogers and Shaw are also taking the necessary steps to oppose the Commissioner’s application to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On June 3, 2022, each of Rogers and Shaw filed a written response disputing the basis for the Commissioner’s application, and on June 16, 2022, the Commissioner filed his written reply to these responses. On June 17, 2022, the Tribunal issued an order setting the timeframe for its consideration of the Commissioner’s application. The Tribunal’s scheduling order includes a voluntary mediation process, currently scheduled for July, in which the parties have agreed to participate. Should it be required, the Tribunal hearing of the Commissioner’s application is expected to occur in November and December of this calendar year.

Rogers and Shaw strongly believe the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy, resulting in a combined entity with the capabilities necessary to invest in digital infrastructure, create jobs, drive innovation, increase choice, and bridge the digital divide. In addition, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction will foster greater competition by creating Canada’s most robust wholly-owned national network, and generating more choice for businesses and consumers so they may realize the full economic and social benefits of next generation networks.

As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust agreed to extend the Outside Date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from June 13, 2022 to July 31, 2022 in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement. Subject to receipt of all required approvals and satisfaction of all closing conditions, the parties are working towards closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction on or before July 31, 2022. Nonetheless, the time required for Rogers and Shaw to address the Commissioner’s concerns and agree on the terms of a negotiated settlement with the Commissioner (or any associated litigation, including the Tribunal hearing), as well as ISED approval, and any appeals of the outcomes of these processes, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com and EDGAR profile at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.

Wireless

Our Wireless division currently operates in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, covering approximately 50% of the Canadian population.

Third quarter Wireless revenue increased 4.4% to $311 million and adjusted EBITDA of $129 million increased 12.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue increased 8.9% to $245 million due to an increased subscriber base, while Wireless equipment revenue decreased 9.6% to $66 million as the number of devices sold in the quarter decreased compared to the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA is mainly due to continued service revenue growth as well as the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter.

We have over 800 wireless retail locations across our operating footprint, including corporate, dealer and national retail, with Shaw Mobile being available in approximately 200 locations in Alberta and British Columbia.

Wireline

In our Wireline business, gig speed Internet is underpinned by our Fibre+ network. Through our digital transformation, we have made it easier to interact with our customers and are leveraging insights from customer data to better understand their preferences so we can provide them with the services they want.

Our focus remains on the execution and delivery of stable and profitable Wireline results. This includes growth in high quality Internet subscribers and improving overall customer account profitability by attracting and retaining higher value households with our 2-year ValuePlans.

Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 24,300 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 36,500 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain of approximately 6,200 Consumer Internet additions, offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 19,900 in the aggregate. In Business, positive Internet RGUs were offset by declines in Video and Phone resulting in Business RGUs declining by approximately 4,300.

Third quarter Wireline revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $1.04 billion and $515 million, respectively, decreased 3.9% and 2.3%, respectively, when compared with the prior year. Consumer revenue of $885 million decreased 5.3% compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental Wireline Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the CRTC decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates as well as growth in Internet revenue offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $153 million increased 5.5% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.

Our Wireline Business division provides connectivity solutions to its customers by leveraging our Smart suite products which provide cost-effective enterprise grade managed IT and communications solutions that are increasingly valued by businesses of all sizes as the digital economy grows in scope and complexity.

In Wireless, the Company added 35,012 net postpaid and prepaid subscribers in the quarter, consisting of 19,392 postpaid additions and 15,620 prepaid additions. Postpaid net additions were down compared to the prior year due to continued strong wireless competition, a limited supply of key devices, bundle adjustments effective in late 2021 for Shaw Mobile, and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile plans.

Wireline RGUs declined by 24,290 in the quarter compared to a loss of 36,461 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain of 6,178 Consumer Internet additions, offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 19,946 in the aggregate. In Business, positive Internet RGUs were offset by declines in Video and Phone resulting in Business RGUs declining by approximately 4,344.

Wireless Postpaid Churn

Wireless postpaid subscriber churn (“postpaid churn”) measures success in retaining subscribers. Wireless postpaid churn is a measure of the number of postpaid subscribers that deactivated during a period as a percentage of the average postpaid subscriber base during a period, calculated on a monthly basis. It is calculated by dividing the number of Wireless postpaid subscribers that deactivated (in a month) by the average number of postpaid subscribers during the month. When used or reported for a period greater than one month, postpaid churn represents the sum of the number of subscribers deactivating for each period incurred divided by the sum of the average number of postpaid subscribers of each period incurred.

Postpaid churn of 1.10% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to 1.07% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Wireless average billing per subscriber unit (ABPU)

Wireless ABPU is an industry metric that is useful in assessing the operating performance of a wireless entity. We use ABPU as a measure that approximates the average amount the Company invoices an individual subscriber unit for service on a monthly basis. ABPU helps us to identify trends and measures the Company’s success in attracting and retaining higher lifetime value subscribers. Wireless ABPU is calculated as service revenue (excluding allocations to wireless service revenue under IFRS 15) divided by the average number of subscribers on the network during the period and is expressed as a rate per month.

ABPU of $37.56 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 decreased by 7.40% from $40.56 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 with a higher proportion of wireless subscribers being Shaw Mobile customers compared to the prior year.

Wireless average revenue per subscriber unit (ARPU)

Wireless ARPU is calculated as service revenue divided by the average number of subscribers on the network during the period and is expressed as a rate per month. This measure is an industry metric that is useful in assessing the operating performance of a wireless entity. ARPU also helps to identify trends and measure the Company’s success in attracting and retaining higher-value subscribers.

ARPU of $36.86 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compares to $36.94 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, representing a modest decrease of 0.22%.

Overview

For detailed discussion of divisional performance see “Discussion of operations.” Highlights of the consolidated third quarter financial results are as follows:

Revenue

Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 of $1.35 billion decreased $29 million, or 2.1%, from $1.38 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, highlighted by the following:

Consumer division revenues of $885 million decreased $50 million, or 5.3%, compared to the prior year period due to an incremental $20 million in revenue in the prior year related to the release of a provision following the CRTC decision on the final aggregated TPIA rates that dated back to August 2019. Excluding the TPIA adjustment, Consumer revenue decreased 3.3% as growth in Internet revenue was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue.The Wireless division contributed $311 million resulting in a $13 million, or 4.4%, increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2021 reflecting a $20 million, or 8.9%, increase in service revenue due to an increased subscriber base partially offset by $7 million, or 9.6%, decrease in equipment revenue as the number of devices sold in the quarter decreased compared to the prior year.The Business division had growth of $8 million, or 5.5%, in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due to Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.

Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, consolidated revenue for the quarter decreased 1.0%, or $13 million. The decrease in revenue over the prior quarter includes a $12 million decrease in the Wireless division driven by a $19 million decrease in equipment revenue, partially offset by an increase in service revenue of $7 million, which includes the impact of the increase in ABPU (up from $37.38 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to $37.56 in the current quarter). Meanwhile, ARPU increased quarter-over-quarter (from $36.43 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to $36.86 in the current quarter). In Wireline, revenues decreased by $2 million over the prior quarter. This was driven by a $2 million decrease in the Consumer division while the Business division revenues remained flat.

Revenue for the nine-month period ended May 31, 2022 of $4.10 billion decreased $41 million, or 1.0%, from $4.13 billion for the comparable period in fiscal 2021, highlighted by the following:

Consumer division revenues of $2.67 billion decreased $87 million, or 3.2%, compared to the prior year period due to an incremental $15 million in revenue in the prior year related to the accrual and release of a provision following the CRTC decision on the final aggregated TPIA rates that dated back to August 2019. Excluding the TPIA adjustment, Consumer revenue decreased 2.4% as growth in Internet revenue was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue.The Wireless division contributed $966 million which included a $64 million, or 9.7%, increase in service revenue compared to the prior year due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a $49 million, or 16.7%, decrease in equipment revenue as more consumers took advantage of bring your own device plans.The Business division had growth of $32 million, or 7.4%, in comparison to the prior year period due to Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products along with the impact of approximately $9 million of revenue related to a financing lease arrangement involving a facility that was designed and built to customer specifications recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 of $644 million increased by $2 million, or 0.3%, from $642 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2021, highlighted by the following:

The year-over-year increase in the Wireless division of $14 million, or 12.2%, is mainly due to continued service revenue growth as well as the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter. Wireless adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5% increased compared to 38.6% in the prior year.The year-over-year decrease in the Wireline division of $12 million, or 2.3%, was primarily due to the decrease in Consumer revenue and includes the TPIA adjustment in the prior year which was effectively offset by equity-based compensation adjustments due to the significant increase in Shaw’s share price and adjustments to employee benefit provisions, both also recorded in the prior year.

Consistent with the variances noted above, adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 47.8% increased 110-basis points compared to 46.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter increased $12 million, or 1.9%, primarily due to a $6 million increase in the Wireless division primarily due to the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter along with a $6 million, or 1.2%, increase in the Wireline division driven by lower equity-based compensation costs primarily due to the impact of a decrease on Shaw’s share price in the quarter and an adjustment to employee benefit provisions recorded in the current quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine-month period ended May 31, 2022 of $1.91 billion increased by $24 million, or 1.3%, from $1.89 billion for the comparable period in fiscal 2021, highlighted by the following:

The year-over-year improvement in the Wireless division of $75 million, or 26.1%, is mainly due to continued service revenue growth and the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current period. Wireless adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.5% compared to 30.2% in the prior year.The year-over-year decrease in the Wireline division of $51 million, or 3.2%, was primarily due to a decrease in Consumer revenue and includes the TPIA adjustment in the prior year which was effectively offset by equity-based compensation adjustments due to the significant increase in Shaw’s share price and adjustments to employee benefit provisions, both also recorded in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in Business service revenue.

Free cash flow

Free cash flow for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 of $217 million decreased $90 million from $307 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, mainly due to a $26 million increase in cash taxes, a $35 million increase in interest on debt and provisions primarily due to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year, and a $33 million increase in capital expenditures.

Net income (loss)

Net income of $203 million and $595 million for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022, respectively, compared to a net income of $354 million and $734 million for the same periods in fiscal 2021. The changes in net income are outlined in the following table:

There were no restructuring activities in fiscal 2022.(3)Net other costs and revenue include accretion of long-term liabilities and provisions, interest, debt retirement costs, realized and unrealized foreign exchange differences, fair value adjustments of private investments, and other losses as detailed in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a $27 million fair value gain on private investments in this category. In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $2 million, $3 million, and $8 million respectively, in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related advisory, legal, financial, and other professional costs compared to $18 million in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Non-GAAP and additional financial measures

The Company’s continuous disclosure documents may provide discussion and analysis of non-GAAP financial measures or ratios. These financial measures or ratios do not have standard definitions prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. The Company’s continuous disclosure documents may also provide discussion and analysis of additional financial measures. Additional financial measures include line items, headings and sub-totals included in the financial statements.

The Company utilizes these measures in making operating decisions and assessing its performance. Certain investors, analysts and others utilize these measures in assessing the Company’s operational and financial performance and as an indicator of its ability to service debt and return cash to shareholders. The non-GAAP financial measures, ratios and additional financial measures have not been presented as an alternative to revenue, net income or any other measure of performance required by GAAP.

Below is a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures, ratios and additional financial measures used by the Company and provides a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure or provides a reference to such reconciliation.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) is calculated as revenue less operating, general and administrative expenses. It is intended to indicate the Company’s ongoing ability to service and/or incur debt and is therefore calculated before items such as restructuring costs, other gains (losses), amortization (a non-cash expense), taxes and interest. Adjusted EBITDA is one measure used by the investing community to value the business.

Adjusted EBITDA has no directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Alternatively, the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA:

Adjusted EBITDA margin

Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin is also one of the measures used by the investing community to value the business.

Net debt

The Company uses this measure to perform valuation-related analysis and make decisions about the Company’s capital structure. We believe this measure aids investors in analyzing the value of the business and assessing our leverage. Refer to “Liquidity and capital resources” for further detail.

Net debt leverage ratio

The Company uses this non-GAAP ratio to determine its optimal leverage ratio. Refer to “Liquidity and capital resources” for further detail.

Free cash flow

The Company utilizes this measure to assess the Company’s ability to repay debt and pay dividends to shareholders.

Free cash flow is comprised of adjusted EBITDA and then deducting capital expenditures (on an accrual basis and net of proceeds on capital dispositions) and equipment costs (net), interest, cash taxes paid or payable, interest on lease liabilities, lease payments relating to lease liabilities, dividends paid on the preferred shares, and recurring cash funding of pension amounts net of pension expense and adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense or recovery.

Free cash flow has not been reported on a segmented basis. Certain components of free cash flow, including adjusted EBITDA, continue to be reported on a segmented basis. Capital expenditures and equipment costs (net) are also reported on a segmented basis. Other items, including interest and cash taxes, are not generally directly attributable to a segment, and are reported on a consolidated basis.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, Wireline RGUs declined by 24,290 in the quarter compared to a loss of 36,461 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain of 6,178 Consumer Internet additions, offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 19,946 in the aggregate. In Business, positive Internet RGUs were offset by declines in Video and Phone resulting in Business RGUs declining by approximately 4,344.

Revenue highlights include:

Consumer revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 decreased by $50 million, or 5.3%, compared to the prior year period due to an incremental $20 million in revenue in the prior year related to the release of a provision following the CRTC decision on the final aggregated TPIA rates that dated back to August 2019. Excluding the TPIA adjustment, Consumer revenue decreased 3.3% as growth in Internet revenue was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue.

As compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the current quarter revenue decreased by $2 million, or 0.2%.Business revenue of $153 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $8 million, or 5.5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021, due to Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.

As compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the current quarter revenue was flat at $153 million.Wireline revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 decreased $55 million, or 1.7%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2021, primarily due to a $87 million decrease in Consumer revenue which includes an incremental $15 million in revenue in the prior year related to the accrual and release of a provision following the CRTC decision on the final aggregated TPIA rates that dated back to August 2019. Excluding the TPIA adjustment, Consumer revenue decreased 2.6% as growth in Internet revenue was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. This was partially offset by a $32 million increase in Business revenue which includes approximately $9 million of revenue related to a financing lease arrangement involving a facility that was designed and built to customer specifications recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA highlights include:

Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 of $515 million decreased 2.3%, or $12 million, from $527 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Consumer revenue and includes the TPIA adjustment in the prior year which was effectively offset by equity-based compensation adjustments due to the significant increase in Shaw’s share price and adjustments to employee benefit provisions, both also recorded in the prior year.

As compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter increased by $6 million, or 1.2%, driven by lower equity-based compensation costs primarily due to the impact of a decrease on Shaw’s share price in the quarter and an adjustment to employee benefit provisions recorded in the current quarterAdjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 of $1.55 billion decreased 3.2%, or $51 million, from $1.60 billion compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Consumer revenue and includes the TPIA adjustment in the prior year which was effectively offset by equity-based compensation adjustments due to the significant increase in Shaw’s share price and adjustments to employee benefit provisions, both also recorded in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in Business service revenue.

(1)See “Non-GAAP and additional financial measures.”

The Wireless division added 35,012 net postpaid and prepaid subscribers in the quarter, consisting of 19,392 postpaid additions and 15,620 prepaid additions. Postpaid net additions were down compared to the prior year due to continued strong wireless competition, a limited supply of key devices, bundle adjustments effective in late 2021 for Shaw Mobile, and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile plans.

Revenue highlights include:

Revenue of $311 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $13 million, or 4.4%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2021. This was primarily due to a $20 million, or 8.9%, increase in service revenue due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by $7 million, or 9.6%, decrease in equipment revenue as the number of devices sold in the quarter decreased compared to the prior year. There was a 7.4% and 0.2% year-over-year decrease in ABPU to $37.56 and ARPU to $36.86, respectively.

As compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the current quarter revenue decreased $12 million, or 3.7%, driven by a $19 million decrease in equipment revenue, partially offset by an increase in service revenue of $7 million, which includes the impact of the increase in ABPU (up from $37.38 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to $37.56 in the current quarter). Meanwhile, ARPU increased quarter-over-quarter (from $36.43 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to $36.86 in the current quarter).Revenue of $966 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 increased $15 million, or 1.6%, over the first nine months of fiscal 2021. This was primarily due to a $64 million, or 9.7%, increase in service revenue due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a $49 million, or 16.7%, decrease in equipment revenue as more consumers took advantage of bring your own device plans.

Adjusted EBITDA highlights include:

Adjusted EBITDA of $129 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 improved by $14 million, or 12.2%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase is mainly due to continued service revenue growth as well as the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter. Wireless adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5% compared to 38.6% in the prior year.

As compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter increased $6 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter.Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 increased $75 million, or 26.1%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2021. The increase is mainly due to continued service revenue growth and the favorable margin impact from lower equipment sales relative to total wireless revenues in the current quarter. Wireless adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.5% compared to 30.2% in the prior year.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, capital investment of $266 million increased $33 million, or 14.2%, from the comparable period in fiscal 2021. There was a $74 million increase in Wireline spending due to higher investments in combined upgrades, enhancements and replacement categories as well as an increase in new housing development and success-based capital, which was partially offset by a $41 million decrease in Wireless spending as a result of lower planned capital expenditures.

Wireline highlights for the quarter include:

For the quarter, investment in combined upgrades, enhancements and replacement categories was $119 million which is an increase of $36 million, or 43.4%, over the prior year period.Investments in new housing development were $35 million, a $6 million, or 20.7%, increase over the prior year period, driven by higher residential and commercial customer network growth and acquisition in the current year.Success-based capital for the quarter of $70 million was $35 million, or 100%, higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher equipment purchases in the period.Investments in buildings and other in the amount of $13 million was $3 million lower year-over year primarily due to higher proceeds on the disposal of certain network assets in the current period.

Wireless highlights for the quarter include:

Capital investment of $29 million in the third quarter decreased relative to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 by $41 million, primarily due to lower planned network related investment in the quarter.

Other income and expense items

Restructuring costs

Restructuring costs generally include severance, employee related costs and other costs directly associated with a restructuring program. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $12 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, $1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and $1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, in each case primarily related to severance and employee related costs. There were no restructuring activities in fiscal 2022.

Amortization of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other increased 1.0% for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and increased 0.6% for the nine months ended May 31, 2022, when compared to the same periods in fiscal 2021. The increase in amortization reflects the amortization of new expenditures exceeding the amortization of assets that became fully amortized during the period.

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased $35 million, or 112.9%, and $32 million, or 19.5%, respectively, over the comparable periods which primarily reflects a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the third quarter of the prior year.

Other gains/losses

This category generally includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on U.S. dollar denominated current assets and liabilities, gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, realized and unrealized gains and losses on private investments, and the Company’s share of the operations of Burrard Landing Lot 2 Holdings Partnership. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a $27 million fair value gain on private investments in this category. In the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $2 million, $3 million, and $8 million respectively, in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related advisory, legal, financial, and other professional costs compared to $18 million in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Income taxes

Income taxes are higher in the quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due mainly to a revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in the prior year, which decreased income tax expense by $125 million.

F22 Q1In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, net income was flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $6 million decrease in income taxes and a decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $1 million, partially offset by an increase in amortization of $5 million and an increase in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related costs of $1 million, all in the second quarter.F22 Q1 vs 
F21 Q4In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, net income decreased $56 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 mainly due to an $88 million increase in taxes in the first quarter as a result of the recognition of a tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter partially offset by a $19 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $10 million decrease in amortization expense, all in the first quarter.F21 Q4 vs F21 Q3In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, net income decreased $102 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 mainly due to a $36 million increase in interest expense and a $126 million increase in current taxes in the fourth quarter as a result of a revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions which reduced these expenses by $35 million and $125 million respectively in the third quarter as well as a $28 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA partially offset by an $81 million decrease in deferred taxes resulting mainly from the recognition of a tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses and a decrease of $15 million in other expenses mainly due to lower Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related costs, all in the fourth quarter.

F21 Q3 vs
F21 Q2In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, net income increased $137 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 mainly due to a $131 million decrease in current income taxes expense and a $36 million decrease in interest expense mainly due to a revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in the period, which reduced these expenses by $125 million and $35 million respectively, a $9 million decrease in deferred taxes, and a $5 million increase in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by $18 million in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related advisory, legal, financial, and other professional fees in the quarter and the impact of the $27 million fair value gain on private investments recorded in the second quarter.F21 Q2 vs

Financial position

Total assets were $15.8 billion at May 31, 2022 compared to $15.8 billion at August 31, 2021. The following is a discussion of significant changes in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position since August 31, 2021.

Current assets increased $101 million primarily due to increases in cash of $135 million, accounts receivable of $35 million, other current assets of $36 million, and inventories of $13 million, partially offset by decreases in income taxes recoverable of $87 million and the current portion of contract assets of $31 million. Cash increased primarily due to funds flow from operations, partially offset by the payment of $444 million in dividends, cash outlays for investing activities, and payment of lease liabilities. Refer to “Liquidity and capital resources” for more information.

Accounts receivable increased $35 million mainly due to timing and a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts.

The current portion of contract assets decreased $31 million over the period due to a $2 million decrease in deferred Wireline costs as a result of lower onboarding promotional activity for new subscribers over the past year and a $29 million decrease due to a decrease in Wireless subscribers participating in the Company’s discretionary wireless handset discount program over the past year. Under IFRS 15, up-front promotional offers, such as onboarding or switch credits, offered to new two-year value-plan customers are recorded as a contract asset and amortized over the life of the contract against future service revenues while the portion of the Wireless discount relating to the handset is applied against equipment revenue at the point in time that the handset is transferred to the customer while the portion relating to service revenue is recorded as a contract asset and amortized over the life of the contract against future service revenues.

Property, plant and equipment decreased $147 million as the amortization of capital and right-of-use assets exceeded the capital investments and additions to right-of-use assets in the period.

Current liabilities decreased $157 million during the period primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable of $169 million, current portion of contract liabilities of $9 million, and current portion of derivatives of $1 million. This decrease was partially offset by an $18 million increase in income taxes payable, a $3 million increase in current portion of lease liabilities and a $1 million increase in current provisions.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased due to the timing of payments and fluctuations in various payables including capital expenditures, interest and employee incentive plans.

Lease liabilities decreased $68 million mainly due to principal repayments of $85 million in the period, partially offset by an increase of $18 million in net new lease liabilities.

Shareholders’ equity increased $256 million mainly due to an increase in retained earnings. Retained earnings increased as the current period net income of $595 million was greater than the dividends of $394 million. Share capital increased $13 million due to the issuance of 454,285 and 10,085 Class B Shares under the Company’s stock option plan and RSU plan, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $42 million primarily due to the remeasurement recorded on employee benefit plans.

As at June 15, 2022, there were 477,029,107 Class B Shares and 22,372,064 Class A Shares issued and outstanding. As at June 15, 2022, 6,964,027 Class B Shares were issuable on exercise of outstanding options. Shaw is traded on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges and is included in the S&P/TSX 60 Index (Trading Symbols: TSX – SJR.B, NYSE – SJR, and TSXV – SJR.A). For more information, please visit www.shaw.ca.

Liquidity and capital resources

In the nine-month period ended May 31, 2022, the Company generated $670 million of free cash flow and increased its cash balance $135 million. Shaw used its remaining free cash flow and proceeds from the issuance of Class B Shares of $12 million to pay common share dividends of $444 million, pay $13 million in Rogers-Shaw Transaction-related costs, and fund the net working capital change.

Debt structure and financial policy

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program with a Canadian financial institution which allows it to sell certain trade receivables into the program. As at May 31, 2022, the proceeds of the sales were committed up to a maximum of $200 million (with $200 million drawn under the program as at May 31, 2022). The Company continues to service and retain substantially all of the risks and rewards relating to the trade receivables sold, and therefore, the trade receivables remain recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and the funding received is recorded as a current liability (revolving floating rate loans) secured by the trade receivables. The buyer’s interest in the accounts receivable ranks ahead of the Company’s interest and the program restricts it from using the trade receivables as collateral for any other purpose. The buyer of the trade receivable has no claim on any of the Company’s other assets. Effective May 26, 2022, the Company amended the terms of its accounts receivable securitization program to extend the term of the program to May 31, 2023.

As at May 31, 2022, the net debt leverage ratio for the Company was 2.2x. The terms of the Arrangement Agreement require Shaw to obtain Rogers’ consent prior to incurring certain types of indebtedness.

The Company calculates net debt leverage ratio as follows(1):  (millions of Canadian dollars)May 31, 2022 August 31, 2021Short-term borrowings200  200 Current portion of long-term debt1  1 Current portion of lease liabilities113  110 Long-term debt4,551  4,549 Lease liabilities1,064  1,135 Cash and cash equivalents(490) (355)(A) Net debt(2)5,439  5,640 (B) Adjusted EBITDA(2)2,523  2,500 (A/B) Net debt leverage ratio(3)2.2x  2.3x

See “Non-GAAP and additional financial measures” for further information about this ratio.

On November 2, 2020, the Company announced that it had received approval from the TSX to establish an NCIB program. The program commenced on November 5, 2020 and ended November 4, 2021. As approved by the TSX, the Company had the ability to purchase for cancellation up to 24,532,404 Class B Shares representing approximately 5% of all of the issued and outstanding Class B Shares as at October 22, 2020. In connection with the announcement of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction on March 15, 2021, the Company suspended share buybacks under its NCIB program.

Shaw’s credit facilities are subject to customary covenants which include maintaining minimum or maximum financial ratios.

Covenant as at
May 31, 2022 Covenant LimitShaw Credit Facilities Total Debt to Operating Cash Flow(1) Ratio1.74:1 < 5.00:1Operating Cash Flow(1) to Fixed Charges(2) Ratio10.91:1 > 2.00:1

(1)Operating Cash Flow, for the purposes of the covenants, is calculated as net earnings before interest expense, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, and current and deferred income taxes, excluding profit or loss from investments accounted for on an equity basis, less payments made with regards to lease liabilities for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by four, plus cash dividends and other cash distributions received in the most recently completed four fiscal quarters from investments accounted for on an equity basis.(2)Fixed Charges are broadly defined as the aggregate interest expense, excluding the interest related to lease liabilities, for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by four.

As at May 31, 2022, Shaw is in compliance with these covenants and based on current business plans, the Company is not aware of any condition or event that would give rise to non-compliance with the covenants over the life of the borrowings which currently mature in December of 2024.

As at May 31, 2022, the Company had $490 million of cash on hand and its $1.5 billion bank credit facility was fully undrawn.

Based on the aforementioned financing activities, available credit facilities and forecasted free cash flow, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, obligations and working capital requirements, including maturing debt, during the upcoming year. The terms of the Arrangement Agreement require that the Company maintain sufficient liquidity to pay an $800 million termination fee payable by Shaw in certain circumstances.

For the three months ended May 31, 2022, the cash received from operating activities increased slightly over the comparable period in fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in the net change in non-cash balances related to operations in the funds flow from operations, partially offset by a decrease in funds flow from operations. The net change in non-cash balances related to operations fluctuated over the comparative period due to changes in accounts receivable, inventory and other current asset balances, and the timing of payments of current income taxes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

For the three months ended May 31, 2022, the cash used in investing activities decreased by $6 million over the comparable period in fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment of $10 million and decrease in additions to equipment costs of $3 million, partially offset by increases in additions to property, plant and equipment of $3 million and additions to other intangibles of $4 million.

Financing Activities The changes in financing activities during the comparative periods were as follows: Three months ended May 31, Nine months ended May 31,(millions of Canadian dollars)2022 2021  2022 2021 Repayment of long-term debt(1)(1) (1)(1)Payment of lease liabilities [note 6](27)(24) (85)(82)Issue of Class B Shares [note 11]5 14  12 15 Purchase of Class B Shares- (36) - (336)Dividends paid on Class A Shares and Class B Shares(148)(148) (444)(449)Dividends paid on Preferred Shares- (2) - (6) (171)(197) (518)(859)

Contractual Obligations

There has been no material change in the Company’s contractual obligations, including commitments for capital expenditures, between August 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022.

Accounting standards

The MD&A included in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended August 31, 2021 outlined critical accounting policies, including key estimates and assumptions that management has made under these policies, and how they affect the amounts reported in the 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. The MD&A also describes significant accounting policies where alternatives exist. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended August 31, 2021. The condensed interim Consolidated Financial Statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of application as the 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

Related party transactions

The Company’s transactions with related parties are discussed in its MD&A for the year ended August 31, 2021 under “Related Party Transactions” and under Note 29 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended August 31, 2021.

There has been no material change in the Company’s transactions with related parties between August 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022.

Financial instruments

There has been no material change in the Company’s risk management practices with respect to financial instruments between August 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022. See “Known Events, Trends, Risks and Uncertainties – Interest Rates, Foreign Exchange Rates and Capital Markets” in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended August 31, 2021 and the section entitled “Financial Instruments” under Note 30 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended August 31, 2021.

Internal controls and procedures

Details relating to disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), are discussed in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended August 31, 2021 under “Certification.” As at May 31, 2022, there have been no changes in the Company’s ICFR that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR in fiscal 2022.

Risks and uncertainties

The significant risks and uncertainties affecting the Company and its business are discussed in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended August 31, 2021 under “Known Events, Trends, Risks and Uncertainties.” Developments of note since then are as follows:

The completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is still subject to the two remaining regulatory approvals under the Competition Act (Canada)and the Radiocommunication Act (Canada) which may delay or prevent completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction

On May 30, 2022, Rogers and Shaw entered into an interim consent agreement with the Commissioner, pursuant to which Rogers and Shaw have agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor announced a divestiture agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor, which is still subject to regulatory approval by the Commissioner and the Minister, and conditional on: (i) the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction; and (ii) entering into definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date as Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Shaw, Rogers and Quebecor strongly believe the divestiture agreement effectively addresses the concerns raised by the Commissioner and the Minister regarding viable and sustainable wireless competition in Canada in order to obtain approval of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

If the Commissioner does not approve the terms of the divestiture agreement, which provides for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor, it is unlikely a negotiated settlement will be reached. In that case, Rogers and Shaw will be permitted to close the Rogers-Shaw Transaction only if the Tribunal declines to prohibit the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, as requested by the Commissioner. Separate from the Tribunal proceedings, Rogers and Shaw must also obtain ISED approval for all applicable spectrum licence transfers. Although Rogers’ and Shaw’s belief that the Commissioner’s application is without merit is strengthened by the agreement concluded with Quebecor for the sale of Freedom Mobile, the outcome of a Tribunal hearing or any associated appeals is inherently uncertain and could: (i) result in significant delays to either the closing or the termination of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction; or (ii) prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. There can also be no assurance of ISED approval being received, received on time, or at all. There can also be no assurance that the Outside Date (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction will be further extended by the parties (if required). In addition, a significant portion of Rogers’ debt financing to fund the purchase price for the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is subject to mandatory redemption if the Rogers-Shaw Transaction has not closed prior to December 31, 2022. Any delay in closing beyond this date will require Rogers to either refinance such debt financing or obtain a consent from the holders of such debt to amend the date for the mandatory redemption provisions, and there can be no guarantee that Rogers will be able to complete any such refinancing or amendment on terms that are acceptable to Rogers, or at all.

Government regulations and regulatory developments

See the Company’s MD&A for the year ended August 31, 2021 for a discussion of the significant regulations that affected our operations as of October 29, 2021. The following is a list of the significant regulatory developments since that date.

For a discussion of the regulatory approval processes related to the Rogers-Shaw Transaction in the Annual Report, see “About our Business – Shaw and Rogers Transaction” and “Known Events, Trends Risks and Uncertainties – Risks Related to the Transaction – The Key Regulatory Approvals necessary to complete the Transaction may not be obtained or may only be obtained after substantial delay”.

Broadcasting Act

Legislative Changes and Other Government Actions

On December 16, 2021, the Federal Government issued Ministerial mandate letters. The Minister of Canadian Heritage has been directed to “reintroduce legislation to reform the Broadcasting Act to ensure foreign web giants contribute to the creation and promotion of Canadian stories and music.” The fulfillment of the foregoing Ministerial mandate could lead to legislative changes and the introduction of new regulatory measures that result in new costs and fees payable by the Company in connection with its provision of digital media services, result in new competition in the provision of broadcasting distribution services, and/or negatively impact the Company’s financial results from broadcasting.

On February 2, 2022, the Minister of Heritage introduced a bill to amend the Broadcasting Act (Bill C-11). Bill C-11 completed second reading on May 12, 2022. On June 14, 2022, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage completed its study of the bill and presented its report to the House of Commons on June 15, 2022. On June 21, 2022, Bill C-11 passed Third Reading in the House of Commons and was sent to the Senate for consideration. The Senate completed First Reading on June 21, 2022. While Bill C-11 does not introduce material new obligations applicable to or fees payable by the Company’s cable, Direct-to-Home (DTH), Satellite Relay Distribution or digital media services, the Bill remains subject to amendment prior to its passage, pursuant to the parliamentary process. In addition, the CRTC will, subsequent to any royal assent to Bill C-11, engage in one or more proceedings to align Canadian broadcasting regulation with the amended Broadcasting Act. Furthermore, the Minister of Heritage has indicated that the CRTC’s subsequent regulatory processes will be subject to a Direction by the Governor-in-Council that sets out the Government’s expectations with respect to how the newly-incorporated amendments to the Broadcasting Act should be reflected in regulation, which Direction may also specify the requirement that new regulations be brought into force within a relatively short timeframe.

The implementation of new regulatory measures in connection with Bill C-11 could impact the Company’s cable and DTH services if regulatory fees and obligations are not applied symmetrically as between licensed and unlicensed entities.

Telecommunications Act

New Government Policy Direction to CRTC Regarding Telecommunications

On June 4, 2022, the Government published a proposed Policy Direction in the Canada Gazette with respect to the CRTC’s oversight of telecommunications regulation. The Telecommunications Act provides authority for the Government to issue directions of general application to the CRTC on broad policy matters, which are intended to lay out the Government’s priorities for telecommunications. The Government has proposed that the new Policy Direction repeal and replace both of the existing Policy Directions introduced in 2006 and 2019. The Company and other parties have the opportunity to comment on, and propose changes to, the proposed Policy Direction until July 19, 2022, and it is expected to come into force in late 2022. The new Policy Direction, as proposed, would maintain most of the 2019 Policy Direction, which directs the CRTC to consider how measures can promote all forms of competition as well as affordability, consumer interests and innovation. It also retains an instruction from the 2006 Policy Direction that regulatory measures should be efficient and proportionate to their purpose, but disposes of that Policy Direction’s emphasis on reliance on market forces. Most of the proposed Policy Direction is new and includes specific instructions to the CRTC on fixed internet and mobile wireless competition, consumer welfare, and universal access policy matters. Once implemented in its final form, the Policy Direction will apply to all telecommunications regulatory measures, including those affecting the Company’s Consumer and Business Internet and Phone services, wholesale telecommunications services, and Wireless services. The impact of the Policy Direction will depend on the final text and how the CRTC interprets and applies it in the context of specific matters and proceedings. 

Wireless Review – Petition of Data On Tap Inc.

On April 14, 2022, Cabinet rejected the petition of Data on Tap Inc. (a mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) operating as “dotmobile”) to vary the CRTC’s Wireless Review decision. Data On Tap Inc. had sought broadened access to mandated MVNO through the elimination of certain eligibility criteria and the time limitation, as well as regulated rates.

Imposition of an Administrative Monetary Penalty on Bell Canada

In April 2021, the CRTC found that Bell Canada had breached three sections of the Telecommunications Act in relation to its processing of permit applications, filed by Videotron Ltd., for access to Bell’s support structures. Following a public consultation to determine the appropriateness of issuing an administrative monetary penalty (“AMP”) in relation to the violations, on June 15, 2022, the CRTC imposed a $7.5M AMP on Bell Canada. The imposition of an AMP for violations of this nature suggests an increasing willingness on the part of the CRTC to use this enforcement tool, heightening the risk of such penalties for contraventions of the Telecommunications Act, regulations, or CRTC decisions in the future.

Radiocommunication Act

Consultation on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 26, 28 and 38 GHz Bands

On June 6, 2022, ISED initiated a new consultation on the licensing framework for spectrum in the 26, 28 and 38 GHz (also known as “millimetre wave” or “mmWave”) bands. The consultation follows ISED’s 2019 decision to make 1850 MHz of spectrum in the 26-28 GHz bands and 2400 MHz of spectrum in the 38 GHz band available for mobile use. In this consultation, ISED seeks comment on its proposal to implement pro-competitive measures in the mmWave auction through the use of an 800 MHz set-aside or cap (across all bands). ISED also seeks input on appropriate licence tier size and term, deployment obligations, auction format, and treatment of existing users in the bands. The consultation will close on October 7, 2022. The outcome of the auction could enhance competition in the wireless sector.

Consultation on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 3800 MHz Band

Parties have filed their initial and reply comments in connection with ISED consultation on the policy and licensing framework for the 3800 MHz spectrum band (3650-4200 MHz). The consultation considered the implementation of pro-competitive measures, in the form of a set-aside, a cross-band cap applicable to cumulative 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz holdings, or a combination of both. ISED also sought comments on, among other things, licence tier sizes and conditions, and auction format and rules. The consultation is now closed and ISED is expected to render its decision in the second half of 2022. The 3800 MHz auction is anticipated to take place in 2023. The outcome of this auction could increase competition in the wireless sector.

New Licence-Exempt Spectrum Consultations

On February 24, 2022, ISED commenced two consultations on the potential release of additional spectrum for licence-exempt use. This includes spectrum in the 5850-5895 MHz range and various high-frequency ranges above 95 GHz. These consultations could result in additional spectrum being made available for licence-exempt technologies including Wi-Fi and the Internet of Things. These consultations are now closed. Decisions from ISED are expected in Fall 2022.

Copyright Act

Legislative Changes and Other Government Actions

The Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry were directed, pursuant to mandate letters issued December 16, 2021, “to amend the Copyright Act to further protect artists, creators and copyright holders, including to allow resale rights for artists.” Any amendments to the Copyright Act that modify the terms and conditions applicable to the use of content, including new rights and/or the scope of flexibility pursuant to exceptions under the Copyright Act, could create increased fees and negatively impact the business practices of the Company, as well as the ability to serve our customers.

Judicial Review of the Distant Television Signal Retransmission Tariff Rates (2014-2018)

On December 18, 2018, the Copyright Board released a rate decision for the Distant Television Signal Retransmission Tariff (the “Tariff”) for the past tariff period of 2014-2018, inclusive, which introduced a rate increase that applied retroactively, and established an interim tariff for the 2019-2023 period based on the 2018 rate. Both the collective societies representing distant television signal retransmission rightsholders (the “Collectives”) and Objectors – including the Company – filed a Notice of Application for judicial review with the FCA on November 4, 2019. On July 23, 2021, the FCA dismissed the Objectors’ application on all grounds, and granted the Collectives’ application on two grounds, for the years 2016-2018, requiring the Copyright Board to redetermine two valuation issues related to the Tariff. On September 29, 2021, the Objectors filed an application for leave to appeal the FCA decision with the Supreme Court of Canada (“SCC”). On March 24, 2022, the SCC leave application was dismissed. The Board’s redetermination of the valuation issues could subject the Company to significantly increased royalty rates for the 2016-2018 period.

Privacy and Anti-Spam Legislation

The Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry was directed, pursuant to a mandate letter issued December 16, 2021, to introduce legislation to advance the Digital Charter, strengthen privacy protections for consumers and provide a clear set of rules that ensure fair competition in the online marketplace. On June 16, 2022, the Government introduced Bill C-27, the Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022 (“DCIA 2022”). The proposed legislation builds upon the Government’s previous attempt to modernize Canada’s Privacy Laws (Bill C-11, which was introduced in November 2020 but did not proceed to passage) and will replace Canada’s existing federal privacy statute (the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). The DCIA 2022 is comprised of 3 proposed Acts: the Consumer Privacy Protection Act; the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act; and the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act. The DCIA 2022 is expected to pass as early as Fall 2022, and will include a significant transition period prior to its coming into force. It will require the Company to incur costs to adjust its policies and practices related to privacy, as well as data collection, management, disposal, access practices and the usage of Artificial Intelligence to ensure compliance; could limit the Company’s ability to utilize data in support of its business, as well as preserve and expand its customer base; and expose the Company to the risk of significant penalties and claims (including pursuant to a proposed right of private action) in connection with any non-compliance.

Cybersecurity Legislation

On June 14, 2022, the Government introduced new cybersecurity legislation, Bill C-26, An Act Respecting Cyber Security (the “Bill”). The Bill will modify the Telecommunications Act to grant the Governor in Council and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry broad powers to mandate any necessary action to protect Canada’s telecommunications system. In addition, the legislation introduces the Critical Cyber Systems Protection Act (“CCSPA”) which aims to strengthen baseline cybersecurity for services and systems that are vital to national security and public safety, and which will introduce a regulatory regime requiring operators in the telecommunications, finance, federally regulated energy, and federally regulated transport sectors to protect their critical cyber systems. The Bill introduces significant fines for non-compliance, up to $10 million for the first violation of an Order issued or regulations introduced pursuant to the proposed amendments to the Telecommunications Act, and $15 million for the first and any subsequent violations of the CCSPA and regulations introduced pursuant to the CCSPA. Such changes could result in the Company incurring significant new costs to ensure compliance or, in the event of any finding of non-compliance, as penalties in connection therewith. Bill C-26 has received First Reading in the House. While the timing for subsequent readings, referral to Committee for consideration, and passage have not yet been determined, the Bill may be passed into law by the end of the year.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)

May 31, 2022 and May 31, 2021
[all amounts in millions of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts]

1. CORPORATE INFORMATION

Shaw Communications Inc. (the “Company”) is a diversified Canadian connectivity company whose core operating business is providing: Cable telecommunications, Satellite video services and data networking to residential customers, businesses and public-sector entities (“Wireline”); and wireless services for voice and data communications (“Wireless”). The Company’s shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (Symbol: TSX - SJR.B, NYSE - SJR, and TSXV - SJR.A).

On March 15, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Rogers Communications Inc. (“Rogers”), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw’s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (“Class A Shares”) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (“Class B Shares”) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the “Rogers-Shaw Transaction”). Holders of Shaw Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively the “Shaw Family Shareholders”)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the “Rogers Shares”) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash.

The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw’s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.

Regulatory Approval Status

On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw’s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On April 27, 2022, the National Pensioners Federation and Public Interest Advocacy Centre (NPF-PIAC) filed a Petition to the federal Cabinet requesting that the CRTC decision approving the change of ownership and effective control of Shaw’s licensed broadcasting assets be set aside or referred back to the CRTC for reconsideration and hearing. On June 22, 2022, Cabinet declined to consider the NPF-PIAC Petition.

The Rogers-Shaw Transaction remains under review by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (“ISED”), as the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry must approve any direct or indirect transfer of Shaw’s spectrum licences.

In accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Rogers and Shaw filed pre-merger notifications pursuant to Part IX of the Competition Act (Canada) in April 2021 to trigger the Competition Bureau’s review of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner of Competition (the “Commissioner”) filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Competition Bureau’s case can be heard by the Tribunal. The Commissioner must ultimately prove his case before the Tribunal in a hearing in order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from being completed.

On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner’s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As a result, there is no need for the Tribunal to hear the Commissioner’s application for an interim injunction. Resolving the interim injunction application allows the parties to focus on addressing the Commissioner’s concerns with the Rogers-Shaw Transaction in order to reach a settlement.

Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor

Subsequent to quarter-end, on June 17, 2022, Rogers and Shaw entered into a divestiture agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor Inc. (“Quebecor”) for a purchase price of $2.85 billion (the “Freedom Transaction”), which is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry (the “Minister”), and conditional on: (i) the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction; and (ii) entering into definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date as Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Shaw, Rogers and Quebecor strongly believe the agreement effectively addresses the concerns raised by the Commissioner and the Minister regarding viable and sustainable wireless competition in Canada.

Under the terms of the divestiture agreement, Quebecor will acquire all Freedom Mobile-branded wireless and Internet customers as well as all of Freedom Mobile’s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations. The agreement does not contemplate the divestiture of Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers. The Freedom Transaction includes long-term agreements by Shaw and Rogers to provide Quebecor transport services (including backhaul and backbone), roaming services and other services for the provision of Freedom’s mobile wireless network. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom’s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom’s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. The parties will work expeditiously and in good faith to finalize definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date as Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Closing of the Freedom Transaction will occur substantially concurrently with closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

Rogers and Shaw Continue to Work with Regulatory Authorities to Secure the Requisite Regulatory Approvals

Rogers and Shaw continue to engage constructively with the Competition Bureau in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement, which offers the most expeditious path forward to closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and delivering its benefits to Canadians. While the divestiture agreement with Quebecor provides a basis for advancing settlement negotiations with the Commissioner, Rogers and Shaw are also taking the necessary steps to oppose the Commissioner’s application to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. On June 3, 2022, each of Rogers and Shaw filed a written response disputing the basis for the Commissioner’s application, and on June 16, 2022, the Commissioner filed his written reply to these responses. On June 17, 2022, the Tribunal issued an order setting the timeframe for its consideration of the Commissioner’s application. The Tribunal’s scheduling order includes a voluntary mediation process, currently scheduled for July, in which the parties have agreed to participate. Should it be required, the Tribunal hearing of the Commissioner’s application is expected to occur in November and December of this calendar year.

In order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust agreed to extend the Outside Date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from June 13, 2022 to July 31, 2022 in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement. Subject to receipt of all required approvals and satisfaction of all closing conditions, the parties are working towards closing of Rogers-Shaw Transaction on or before July 31, 2022. Nonetheless, the time required for Rogers and Shaw to address the Commissioner’s concerns and agree on the terms of a negotiated settlement with the Commissioner (or any associated litigation, including the Tribunal hearing), as well as ISED approval, and any appeals of the outcomes of these processes, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.

When estimating minimum transaction prices allocated to the remaining unfilled, or partially unfulfilled, performance obligations, Shaw applied the practical expedient to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and for those contracts where we bill the same value as that which is transferred to the customer. The estimated amounts disclosed are based upon contractual terms and maturities. Revenues recognized based on actual minimum transaction price, and the timing thereof, will differ from these estimates due to the frequency with which the actual durations of contracts with customers do not match their contractual maturities.

18. FAIR VALUE

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments has been determined as follows:

(i)  Current assets and current liabilities

The fair value of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximates their carrying value due to their short-term nature.

(ii) Investments and other assets and other long-term assets

The fair value of publicly traded investments is determined by quoted market prices. Investments in private entities which do not have quoted market prices in an active market and whose fair value cannot be readily measured are carried at approximate fair value. No published market exists for such investments. These equity investments have been made as they are considered to have the potential to provide future benefit to the Company and accordingly, the Company has no current intention to dispose of these investments in the near term. The fair value of long-term receivables approximates their carrying value as they are recorded at the net present values of their future cash flows, using an appropriate discount rate.

(iii) Long-term debt

The carrying value of long-term debt is at amortized cost based on the initial fair value as determined at the time of issuance or at the time of a business acquisition. The fair value of publicly traded notes is based upon current trading values. The fair value of finance lease obligations is determined by discounting future cash flows using a rate for loans with similar terms, conditions and maturity dates. The carrying value of bank credit facilities approximates fair value as the debt bears interest at rates that fluctuate with market values. Other notes and debentures are valued based upon current trading values for similar instruments.

The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt are as follows:

May 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Carrying
valueEstimated
fair value Carrying
valueEstimated
fair valueLiabilities Long-term debt (including current portion)(1)4,5524,487 4,5505,263

(1)Level 2 fair value – determined by valuation techniques using inputs based on observable market data, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices.

(iv) Derivative financial instruments

The fair value of US currency forward purchase contracts is determined by an estimated credit-adjusted mark-to-market valuation using observable forward exchange rates at the end of reporting periods and contract forward rates.

19. INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL

Impairment testing of indefinite-life intangibles and goodwill

The Company performs its annual impairment test on goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles as at February 1 each year. There have been no changes to the assets and liabilities making up the CGUs since the last test performed as at February 1, 2021. The prior test also resulted in a recoverable amount that exceeded the carrying amount by a substantial margin. The Company performed a qualitative assessment of the factors impacting the determination of recoverable amount and concluded that the likelihood that a recoverable amount calculation as at February 1, 2022, would be less than the carrying amount of the CGUs is remote. As such, the key assumptions used in the impairment test remain consistent with those disclosed for the February 1, 2021 test.

As a result of the announcement Rogers and Shaw are engaged in a process to sell Freedom Mobile conditioned on the closure of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, management reviewed the estimated recoverable amount of its Wireless CGU and determined that there was no impairment as at May 31, 2022.

20. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On June 17, 2022, Rogers and Shaw entered into a divestiture agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile to Quebecor Inc. (“Quebecor”) for a purchase price of $2.85 billion (the “Freedom Transaction”), which is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry (the “Minister”), and conditional on: (i) the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction; and (ii) entering into definitive documentation on or before July 15, 2022, or such later date as Rogers and Quebecor reasonably agree to in writing. Given the circumstances surrounding the planned sale, management concluded that this bid is not indicative of impairment.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2472555/0/en/Shaw-Announces-Third-Quarter-and-Year-to-Date-Fiscal-2022-Results.html,"['SJR-A-V.V', 'SJR-B-TO.TO', 'SJR-PA-V.TO', 'SJR-PB-V.TO', 'SJR.US']"

AAPL,2022-06-30T21:00:00+00:00,"H2O Innovation Acquires Leader Evaporator Co., Inc.","QUEBEC CITY, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX: HEO) – H2O Innovation Inc. (“H2O Innovation” or the “Corporation”) is proud to announce that the acquisition of the business carried on by Leader Evaporator Co., Inc. (“Leader”) has been concluded today. Leader has been developing, manufacturing and selling maple farming equipment and products for more than 130 years to maple syrup producers located mainly in the United States.

The addition of Leader’s activities to H2O Innovation’s existing maple syrup equipment offering will allow the Corporation to meet the needs of a greater number of maple syrup producers. This new alliance, which combines tradition and innovation, will strengthen the Corporation’s ability to support maple syrup producers in their growth by offering everything from entry-level equipment for smaller producers to state-of-the-art technologies for larger producers. H2O Innovation’s extensive knowledge of membrane filtration will also benefit Leader’s customers.

“The Quebec maple syrup industry is doing extremely well, with a production of over 211 million pounds of maple syrup during the 2022 season. In the United States, the market trend is rising and usually follows Quebec’s. The growing demand and the new quotas to be granted to Canadian producers allow us to conclude this strategic investment with optimism. This acquisition will also allow us to increase our manufacturing capacity by operating on both sides of the border, while optimizing our supply chain from key suppliers and consolidating our purchasing power,” said Frédéric Dugré, President and Chief Executive Officer of H2O Innovation.

H2O Innovation and Leader maple syrup products and equipment will henceforth be offered through a larger distribution network in the United States, with nearly 80 distributors in 10 states.

QUEBEC CITY, June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX: HEO) – H2O Innovation Inc. (“H2O Innovation” or the “Corporation”) is proud to announce that the acquisition of the business carried on by Leader Evaporator Co., Inc. (“Leader”) has been concluded today. Leader has been developing, manufacturing and selling maple farming equipment and products for more than 130 years to maple syrup producers located mainly in the United States.

The addition of Leader’s activities to H2O Innovation’s existing maple syrup equipment offering will allow the Corporation to meet the needs of a greater number of maple syrup producers. This new alliance, which combines tradition and innovation, will strengthen the Corporation’s ability to support maple syrup producers in their growth by offering everything from entry-level equipment for smaller producers to state-of-the-art technologies for larger producers. H2O Innovation’s extensive knowledge of membrane filtration will also benefit Leader’s customers.

“The Quebec maple syrup industry is doing extremely well, with a production of over 211 million pounds of maple syrup during the 2022 season. In the United States, the market trend is rising and usually follows Quebec’s. The growing demand and the new quotas to be granted to Canadian producers allow us to conclude this strategic investment with optimism. This acquisition will also allow us to increase our manufacturing capacity by operating on both sides of the border, while optimizing our supply chain from key suppliers and consolidating our purchasing power,” said Frédéric Dugré, President and Chief Executive Officer of H2O Innovation.

H2O Innovation and Leader maple syrup products and equipment will henceforth be offered through a larger distribution network in the United States, with nearly 80 distributors in 10 states.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:59:45+00:00,UPDATE 1-Russia will replace Sakhalin-2 project operator with new firm,"(Adds details, quotes, context)

June 30 (Reuters) - Russia will create a firm which will take over all rights and obligations of the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company amid Western sanctions imposed on Moscow, a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

The 5-page decree http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/files/ru/kj25EK599KdoG3Pg0Q5AkzuwNEvABMM0.pdf indicates that it is up to the government of sanctions-hit Russia to decide whether foreign shareholders are to remain in the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, a consortium for developing the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project in Russia's far east.

Its shareholders include Russian gas giant Gazprom (50% plus one share) and Shell (27.5% minus one share). Leading Japanese traders, Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp, own stakes of 12.5% and 10% respectively in the firm.

Gazprom will keep its stake, but other shareholders are expected to ask the Russian government for a stake in the new firm within one month, the decree said.

The government will then decide if the other shareholders will be allowed to keep the stake.

If they are not permitted to keep their stake, the government will sell their stakes and keep the proceeds at a special account of the shareholder.

Proceeds from this account can be sent to the shareholder or used to repay unspecified damages under the production sharing agreement, the decree said.

Shell is in talks with a consortium of Indian energy companies to sell its stake in Sakhalin-2, three sources told Reuters in May.

Japan will not leave the Sakhalin 2 project, important for its energy security, even if asked to leave, the Japanese industry minister said in May.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:59:00+00:00,Werner Enterprises Receives Supply &amp; Demand Chain Executive Top Supply Chain Projects Award,"Industry award spotlights leading transportation company’s innovative Event Resolution System

OMAHA, Neb., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Werner Enterprises (Nasdaq: WERN), one of the nation’s largest transportation and logistics companies, announced today that its Event Resolution System (ERS) was selected as a recipient of Supply & Demand Chain Executive’s (SDCE) Top Supply Chain Projects Award for 2022.

The Top Supply Chain Projects Award, formerly known as SDCE 100, spotlights successful and innovative transformation projects delivering bottom-line value to small, medium and large enterprises across a range of supply chain functions. These projects show how supply chain solution and service providers help their customers achieve supply chain excellence and prepare them for success.

As part of the Company’s Werner EDGE initiative, its ERS continuously works to improve driver safety and performance, associate productivity, and customer service levels positioning Werner as an innovator helping to advance the industry. The innovative system gathers data on driver maintenance, safety and potential late delivery events. Then, through strategic partnerships and innovative technologies, it provides Werner associates with a simplified workflow for resolving them.

""Werner Enterprises has always put safety at the top of our values and we are always looking for ways to innovate,” said Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer Daragh Mahon. “We continue to identify ways to expand our technology, not only improving the driver experience, but also focusing on safety for the motoring public. Our ERS technology is helping us move from the reactive maintenance systems that are commonplace today, to a cutting edge predictive and proactive program.""

Through the continued development of ERS, which includes critical event management, shipment alerts, breakdown management, vehicle inspections and more, Werner consolidates events to improve safety, provide increased visibility, and enable increased communication between drivers and the associates who support them.

“The past 18 months have been a tumultuous time for U.S. supply chains,” said Marina Mayer, Editor-in-Chief of Supply & Demand Chain Executive and Food Logistics. “One of the core reasons today’s supply chains haven’t completely fallen apart is because solutions providers have been working diligently to partner with customers and clients to streamline processes, implement emerging technology and deliver results that improve bottom lines and the environment. For many of these collaborations, it’s about achieving full visibility, compete forecasting, end-to-end leverage and the ultimate in sustainability.”  

Werner also received this designation from Supply & Demand Chain Executive in 2021 for its Werner EDGE for Carriers program. Werner EDGE provides alliance carriers with immediate visibility to Werner freight to book loads at the touch of a button, maintain carrier preferences, view tracking information, buy or sell equipment, and communicate directly with Werner associates.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:58:25+00:00,Chinese Stocks in US Top S&amp;P With Best Month in Three Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks listed in the US has staged their best month since early 2019, as investors chase returns with American equities struggling amid mounting recession fears.

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index closed up 16% in June following its 2.6% gain in May, marking its first two-month winning streak since February 2021, right before the shares started to collapse over Beijing’s regulatory crackdowns. New Oriental Education & Technology Group was among top gainers with a 56% climb, while Li Auto Inc. and XPeng Inc. each climbed more than 30%. Tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. rose 18%.

Signals from Chinese officials on policy shifts for the tech industry and easing Covid curbs, coupled with an improved outlook for China’s economy, have helped fuel a rally in the country’s equities traded at home and abroad. The CSI 300 Index, which tracks domestic stocks, jumped 9.6% this month, coming close to a technical bull market, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 2.1%.

China’s World-Beating Stock Rally Is Forecast to Strengthen More

“Some of the best opportunities are often found in situations that go from truly awful to merely bad, and I think that process is underway in Chinese equities overall,” said Cory Lester, managing director of Morgan Creek Capital.

The Golden Dragon Index, which is heavily weighted toward technology, has also outperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index, which lost another 9% in June. The prospect of China’s fiscal and monetary support for its economy presents an appealing alternative for global investors as US shares wobble in the face of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening cycle. The broader S&P 500 Index sank 8.4% in June.

“Stars are being aligned in China equities,” said Calvin Zhang, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. “It is certainly a good place to consider when developed markets are grappling with recession fears.”

Chinese American Depositary Receipts are also benefitting from appealing valuations after tumbling more than 60% from last year’s peak. The group sold off hard earlier this year, “driven by delisting fears with no regards to fundamentals,” as investors were scared their valuations would go to zero, Zhang said. “But for those that have found a secondary listing in Hong Kong, that hedges such a risk, and they are actually looking attractive.”

To be sure, there are reasons to be skeptical about the rebound in Chinese tech shares. For one thing, there are lingering jitters that China’s zero-Covid approach could spur fresh lockdowns. And there’s the prospect of US-listed Chinese stocks being kicked off the New York exchanges, though Washington and Beijing are in talks to settle the dispute.

Investing in Chinese ADRs is a “short-term play,” said Olivier d’Assier, head of APAC applied research at Qontigo in Singapore. Over a longer horizon, investors can’t be fully confident that fundamentals will continue trump regulatory and political risks.

“Volumes in US equities have been low as most investors are on the sidelines these days, and the summer holiday months are just ahead of us,” he wrote in an email. “So, Chinese ADRs look attractive for one last punt before the summer.”

This infrastructure replacement plan and surcharge is reviewed and updated annually by the PSC, and the proposed 2023 rate includes approximately $81.2 million of investment for infrastructure replacement and system upgrades.

""West Virginia American Water’s annual infrastructure replacement program has been in place since 2017, and it gives us the ability to make timely, necessary investments in our water systems,"" said Robert Burton, president of West Virginia American Water. ""This infrastructure investment surcharge has allowed us to improve reliability in our system while reducing long-term costs for our customers.""

West Virginia American Water’s 2023 infrastructure replacement plan includes $25.0 million to replace or upgrade approximately 16 miles of water mains; $6.4 million to replace service lines and fire hydrants; $9.3 million to replace water meters; $3.0 million for booster station upgrades, $3.0 million for three additional storage tanks, and $2.0 million for potential post-acquisition investment on troubled water systems. The resulting proposal is an increase of approximately $2.88 per month to the 2023 Distribution System Improvement Charge for the average residential customer using 2,943 gallons.

In an effort to communicate these investments to customers, West Virginia American Water maintains an Infrastructure Upgrade Map – a user-friendly, easily accessible online map that allows customers to view details about water main replacement projects as they are under construction and completed. West Virginia was the first state within American Water to use an interactive web-based map to display these types of projects, allowing customers to see the size and scope of the investments the company is making across its service area.

""The Infrastructure Upgrade Map and annual DSIC program provide transparency to our customers on the investments we’re making to improve service reliability and provide quality service,"" Burton continued. ""As part of this program, the Public Service Commission provides up-front regulatory review and approval of our proposed infrastructure upgrades to confirm that they are in the best interest of our customers.""

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:54:13+00:00,"Insiders purchases in Imricor Medical Systems, Inc. (ASX:IMR) last year yet to pay off, remain down US$42k despite recent gains","Insiders who purchased US$201k worth of Imricor Medical Systems, Inc. (ASX:IMR) shares over the past year recouped some of their losses after price gained 75% last week. The purchase, however, has proven to be a pricey bet, with losses currently totalling US$42k.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.

See our latest analysis for Imricor Medical Systems

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Imricor Medical Systems

While there weren't any large insider transactions in the last twelve months, it's still worth looking at the trading.

In the last twelve months Imricor Medical Systems insiders were buying shares, but not selling. The average buy price was around AU$0.31. These transactions suggest that insiders have considered the current price of AU$0.24 attractive. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume

There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.

Insiders at Imricor Medical Systems Have Bought Stock Recently

There was some insider buying at Imricor Medical Systems over the last quarter. Independent Non-Executive Director Peter McGregor shelled out AU$66k for shares in that time. It's great to see that insiders are only buying, not selling. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small.

Does Imricor Medical Systems Boast High Insider Ownership?

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. From our data, it seems that Imricor Medical Systems insiders own 15% of the company, worth about AU$5.2m. Overall, this level of ownership isn't that impressive, but it's certainly better than nothing!

What Might The Insider Transactions At Imricor Medical Systems Tell Us?

It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. We would certainly prefer see higher levels of insider ownership but analysis of the insider transactions suggests that Imricor Medical Systems insiders are expecting a bright future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found 6 warning signs for Imricor Medical Systems (2 don't sit too well with us!) that we believe deserve your full attention.

(NYSE: EVA) (""Enviva"" or the ""Company"") today announced that it has priced $250,000,000 of bonds in the U.S. tax-exempt market (the ""Bonds"" or the ""Tax-Exempt Green Bonds"" and such offering, the ""Offering"") through the Industrial Development Authority of Sumter County, Alabama (the ""Issuer""). The Tax-Exempt Green Bonds, which will be issued at par, will bear interest at an annual rate of 6.00% and mature in 2052, with the option for holders to redeem at par in 2032. Enviva and the Issuer expect to close the transaction on or about July 15, 2022, subject to customary closing conditions.

Use of Proceeds

Enviva estimates that the net proceeds of this Offering will be $246,000,000, after deducting the underwriters’ discount and other transaction-related costs. The proceeds of the Offering will be loaned to Enviva pursuant to a Loan and Guaranty Agreement to fund all or a portion of the costs of the acquisition, construction, equipping, and financing of Enviva’s fully contracted wood pellet production plant to be located in Epes, Alabama, and to pay costs and expenses of the Offering.

Designation

Consistent with Enviva’s Green Finance Framework, the Bonds are designated as Green Bonds because the proceeds will be used to finance the construction of a fully contracted wood pellet production plant that will produce a low-carbon, sustainable, renewable, drop-in substitute for fossil fuels to help decarbonize industries and the global economy. Enviva’s Green Finance Framework, which guides issuances of its Green Bonds, was developed in alignment with the Green Bond Principles (2021) as published by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and the Green Loan Principles (2021) published by the Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA).

The Bonds have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, on the basis of the Bonds being exempt securities pursuant to Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

Story continues

This news release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, including the Bonds, nor shall there be any sale of any such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Other Notable Financing

Enviva also announced that it has amended and restated its senior secured revolving credit facility (the ""Amended & Restated Credit Facility"") in a transaction that closed on June 30, 2022. The Amended & Restated Credit Facility extends the maturity to June 2027 from April 2026 and includes other improved terms and conditions as compared to the terms of the credit facility prior to the amendment that more appropriately reflect the conversion of the Company from a master limited partnership to a corporation at the end of 2021, and the implications of the increased scale, diversification, and accelerating growth plans of Enviva, while continuing to maintain the conservative financial policies to which the Company is committed.

About Enviva

Enviva Inc. (NYSE: EVA) is the world’s largest producer of industrial wood pellets, a renewable and sustainable energy source produced by aggregating a natural resource, wood fiber, and processing it into a transportable form, wood pellets. Enviva owns and operates ten plants with a combined production capacity of approximately 6.2 million metric tons per year in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi, and is starting construction on its 11th plant, which will be located in Epes, Alabama. Enviva sells most of its wood pellets through long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with primarily creditworthy customers in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan, helping to accelerate the energy transition and to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement, lime, chemicals, and aviation fuels. Enviva exports its wood pellets to global markets through its deep-water marine terminals at the Port of Chesapeake, Virginia, the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina, and the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and from third-party deep-water marine terminals in Savannah, Georgia, Mobile, Alabama, and Panama City, Florida.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:51:43+00:00,UPDATE 1-JetBlue extends tender offer date for Spirit Airlines,"(Adds background)

June 30 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp said on Thursday it was extending the expiration date of its cash tender offer for Spirit Airlines Inc to July 29 from June 30, after sweetening its bid for the ultra-low-cost carrier earlier this week.

In the latest offer on June 27, JetBlue included a ticking fee of 10 cents per Spirit share, raising the deal value to $34.15 per share.

Spirit Airlines on Wednesday deferred a shareholder vote on Frontier Group Holdings Inc's merger offer for the budget carrier until next week.

Frontier also raised its bid for Spirit last week.

Both bidders see Spirit as an opportunity to expand their domestic footprints at a time when the U.S. airline industry is dogged by labor and aircraft shortages. Either of the deals would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline.

(JEQ) which paid the distribution on June 30, 2022 to all shareholders of record as of May 20, 2022 (ex-dividend date May 19, 2022).

Each Fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income, supplemented by realized capital gains and, to the extent necessary, paid-in capital.

For the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (IAF), the India Fund, Inc. (IFN) and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (JEQ) the stock distributions were automatically paid in newly issued shares of the Fund unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder to be paid in cash.

The reinvestment prices per share for these distributions were as follows: $ 4.6695 for the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (IAF); $ 16.18 for the India Fund, Inc. (IFN) and $ 5.63 for the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (JEQ). Fractional shares were generally settled in cash, except for registered shareholders with book entry accounts at Computershare Investor Services who had whole and fractional shares added to their account.

To have received the abrdn Australia Equity Fund, Inc. (IAF), the India Fund, Inc. (IFN) and the abrdn Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (JEQ) quarterly distributions payable in June 2022 in cash instead of shares of common stock, for shareholders who hold shares in ""street name,"" the bank, brokerage or nominee who holds the shares must have advised the Depository Trust Company as to the full and fractional shares for which they want the distribution paid in cash by June 17, 2022; and for shares that are held in registered form, written notification for the election of cash by registered shareholders must have been received by Computershare Investor Services prior to June 17, 2022.

Under applicable U.S. tax rules, the amount and character of distributable income for each Fund's fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act"") and related rules, the Funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders.

The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the rules adopted thereunder. The tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date, from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital. The estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income, expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies.

Each Fund's estimated sources of the current distribution paid this month and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows:

Estimated Amounts of Current Distribution per Share Fund* Distribution Amount Net Investment Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains** Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital ASGI $0.1200 $0.0144 12% $0.0060 5% $0.0996 83% - - FAX $0.0275 $0.0155 56% - - - - $0.0120 44% IAF $0.1500 $0.0495 33% - - $0.0855 57% $0.0150 10% IFN $0.5300 - - - - $0.5300 100% - - JEQ $0.1200 $0.0144 12% - - $0.0996 83% $0.0060 5%

* ASGI has a 9/30 fiscal year end; FAX, IAF and JEQ have a 10/31 fiscal year end; IFN has a 12/31 fiscal year end.

**includes currency gains.

Where the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a ""Return of Capital,"" it means that Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income.""

As of June 23, 2022, after giving effect to this payment, JEQ estimates it has a net deficit of $1,392,900.00. A net deficit results when the Fund has net unrealized losses that are in excess of any net realized gains that have not yet been distributed.

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. After the end of each calendar year, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

The following table provides the Funds' total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to the Funds' annualized and cumulative distribution rates.

2 Based on the Fund's NAV as of April 30, 2022.

3 The percentage shown does not include the Fund's annual distribution policy in place in 2021.

Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy (the ""Distribution Policy"").

While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.

Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Funds may distribute any long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in Section 19(b) under the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder. Therefore, distributions paid by the Funds during the year may include net income, short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains and/or a return of capital. Net income dividends and short-term capital gain dividends, while generally taxable at ordinary income rates, may be eligible, to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the Funds, to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long-term capital gains. Distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits, and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held. To the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held, capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received.

The payment of distributions in accordance with the Distribution Policy may result in a decrease in the Fund's net assets. A decrease in the Fund's net assets may cause an increase in the Fund's annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the Fund's market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the Fund's net asset value per share. The Distribution Policy may also negatively affect the Fund's investment activities to the extent that the Fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the Fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold, for the purpose of paying the distribution. Each Fund's Board has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Distribution Policy at any time. The amendment, suspension or termination of the Distribution Policy may affect the Fund's market price per share. Investors should consult their tax advisor regarding federal, state and local tax considerations that may be applicable in their particular circumstances.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:46:36+00:00,JetBlue extends tender offer date for Spirit Airlines,"(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp said on Thursday it was extending the expiration date of its cash tender offer for Spirit Airlines Inc to July 29 from June 30, after sweetening its bid for the ultra-low-cost carrier earlier this week.

In the latest offer on June 27, JetBlue included a ticking fee of 10 cents per Spirit share, raising the deal value to $34.15 per share.

Spirit Airlines on Wednesday deferred a shareholder vote on Frontier Group Holdings Inc's merger offer for the budget carrier until next week.

Frontier also raised its bid for Spirit last week.

Both bidders see Spirit as an opportunity to expand their domestic footprints at a time when the U.S. airline industry is dogged by labor and aircraft shortages. Either of the deals would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:45:20+00:00,Bill Gates’ résumé from 1974 features 3 details experts warn you should never include,"Bill Gates, Microsoft cofounder and fourth-richest man in the world, returned to his humble roots on Thursday: He shared his résumé from nearly 50 years ago.

“Whether you’re a recent grad or a college dropout, I’m sure your résumé looks a lot better than mine did 48 years ago,” Gates quipped in a LinkedIn post.

Before diving into his education and work experience, Gates included his “objective”: systems analyst or system programmer. He backed it up with his relevant Harvard coursework, his coding skills from two different jobs in his native Seattle area, and the small fact that he’d worked in partnership with Paul Allen—with whom he would officially found Microsoft the following year.

Gates’ résumé may have been par for the course in 1974, but it includes a few details that today’s experts advise against.

Mistake No. 1: Going too deep

The résumé, which Gates wrote on a typewriter at age 18, includes his then-address (his freshman dorm) as well as some personal details that would be way out of place today. He notes his height (5'10""), his weight (130 pounds), and the fact that he has no dependents.

Gates should have avoided including such irrelevant information. “Sure, you’ve got hobbies, interests, languages, favorite bands, and ambitions,” Marc Cenedella, founder of Leet Résumés, a résumé writing service, told Fortune. “But keep the information that doesn’t address your ability to be responsible, accountable, and a hard worker to a reasonable level.”

Mistake No. 2: Lack of verb variety

While the exact line-by-line format of a résumé can vary, Beth Hendler-Grunt, founder of career coaching service Next Great Step, emphasizes using action verbs to show what you accomplished in each role. She advises against saying “responsible for” at the beginning of each sentence—as in, “I’m responsible for the office filing system.”

Instead, use past-tense action verbs, like “built,” “created,” or “developed”; consider, “I developed a filing system that streamlined the office organizational flow.” And try to use different verbs for each experience.

Story continues

While Gates used “designed” to demonstrate a traffic system he created, his action verbs stopped there. He leaned heavily on “involved with,” which is more passive and repetitive.

Mistake No. 3: Needless distraction

We’ll allow Gates some stylistic choices that don’t make sense today: namely, the business card for what looks like a career services company copied onto the top-left corner. This is especially bad, because it’s in prime real estate where the résumé reader’s eye is going to be drawn first. In that area, you want to stack your accolades, education, and achievements right away—not provide free ad space for a company.

The placement and color makes the résumé appear busy, which Cenedella highly warns against.

Other than that, Gates’ style and format are fairly consistent with a typical recruiter’s expectations. Despite the flaws, it’s safe to say Gates knew what he was doing. Twelve years after he hit “submit” on that résumé, he became a billionaire. Six years after that, he became the world’s richest man.

Maybe the secret to success really is including your height—but we wouldn’t count on it.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:43:08+00:00,These 2 Steel Producers Are Set To Capitalize On Higher Demand,"Volatility has headlined the market year-to-date, and there have been few places for investors to hide. It’s been a tough stretch, to say the least.

Supply chain problems, geopolitical issues, and a hawkish Fed have been the impactful driving forces behind many of the valuation slashes we’ve seen year-to-date. It goes without saying that we’ve found ourselves in a highly unique economic environment coming out of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.

In all the gloom and doom, there are still stocks worth buying. Following the lifting of stay-at-home orders and COVID-19-induced lockdowns, steel demand has gained significant traction in the end-use market.

Two highly-ranked steel producers include Commercial Metals Company CMC and Nucor Corp. NUE. The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of both companies while blending in the S&P 500 as a benchmark. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

As we can see, both companies’ shares have provided a valuable layer of defense and have all outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.

The story remains the same after widening the timeframe to encompass a year’s worth of price action – both companies have outperformed the S&P 500 quite handily. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The strong share performance bodes well for both companies. Additionally, both companies reside in the Zacks Steel – Producers Industry, which currently ranks in the top 34% of all Zacks industries. Companies residing in the top 50% of all Zacks industries have extensively outperformed those in the bottom 50%.

Let’s examine each one a little closer to see why they would be solid bets to capitalize on a surge in steel demand.

Key Factor

The steel industry is a cyclical business. What does that mean? A cyclical business is affected by macroeconomic changes within the overall economy. Generally, they follow the expansion, peak, recession, and recovery cycles.

They have their ups and downs, alluding to why they are coined as cyclical. During their strongest periods, when earnings are at their peak, their price-to-earnings ratios are at their lowest.

Story continues

When earnings are at their lowest, P/E ratios are at their highest. It’s a vital factor to recognize, and it helps explains why these companies’ P/E ratios are so low.

Nucor Corp.

Nucor NUE is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck, and cold-finished bars in the United States. The company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an overall VGM Score of an A.

The company has consistently exceeded bottom line expectations, recording eight EPS beats out of its last ten quarterly reports. Over its previous four quarterly reports, the company has surpassed EPS estimates by an average of 2.2%, and in its latest quarter, the company beat on the bottom line by a respectable 4.4%.

The $8.65 per share estimate for the upcoming quarter reflects a substantial 71% expansion in the bottom line from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, the FY22 EPS estimate of $29.75 pencils in a significant 28% increase in earnings year-over-year.

Quarterly sales are pegged to increase to $11.4 billion for the quarter, a 30% growth in revenue from year-ago quarterly sales of $8.8 billion. Furthermore, FY22 revenue estimates of $42 billion display a substantial 16% expansion of the top line year-over-year.

The company’s forward earnings multiple resides at 3.6X, a fraction of its 2020 high of 27.7X and well below its five-year median of 10.5X. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Commercial Metals Company

Commercial Metals Company CMC manufactures, recycles, and markets steel and metal products, related materials, and services. The company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with an overall VGM Score of a B.

The company has been on a blazing-hot earnings streak, exceeding bottom line expectations in nine of its last ten quarters. Over its previous four, CMC has beat EPS estimates by an average of 15%, and in its latest quarter, the company beat bottom-line estimates handily by 25%.

Growth rates for FY22 appear robust for both the top and bottom lines. The $8.93 EPS estimate for FY22 reflects a massive triple-digit growth in earnings of 150% year-over-year. In addition, the $2.20 EPS estimate for the upcoming quarterly release represents a sizable 75% expansion in the bottom line from the year-ago quarter.

Zacks Consensus Sales estimate for the upcoming quarterly release is pegged at $411.4 million, notching a 25% increase from year-ago quarterly sales of $327 million. Furthermore, the FY22 sales estimate of $1.5 billion reflects a notable 19% growth in revenue year-over-year.

CMC’s current forward earnings multiple resides at 4.5X, a fraction of its high of 23.2X in 2017 and nicely below its five-year median value of 9.6X. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

Both companies are set up perfectly to reap the rewards from a higher level of steel demand upon coming out of the pandemic. In addition, they both carry strong Zacks Ranks, making them appear even more enticing.

It’s vital to remember that steel is a cyclical business that will have its ups and downs. When looking at FY23 estimates for both companies, the earnings picture drastically slows down.

Both stocks would be ideally suited for investors seeking exposure to the steel industry during a period of high demand.

With the S&P 500 down about 20% over the six months, baskets tuned to the favorite bets of those speculating on declines are showing bigger losses.

Across the market, short sellers now sit on an unrealized gain of roughly $300 billion year-to-date, according to an estimate from S3 Partners, a data-analytics firm.

“While the market has trended downward and shorts were making money on the downside, they were actively shorting to the tune of around $144 billion in 2022,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. “Consumer discretionary and technology are the most profitable sectors to short.”

Before this year bears had been almost driven to extinction during relentless equity gains. Now, with the Fed pledging to fight red-hot inflation and ceding its role as bulls’ ally, short sellers are getting their moment to shine.

The windfall from betting against stocks has bolstered performance for hedge funds that usually take both bullish and bearish positions on equities. Those tracked by HFR is about 5 percentage points ahead of the S&P 500 this year through May.

It’s a stunning reversal of fate from the previous 13 years, when hedge funds trailed the market every year.

It’s “vindication of sorts,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer at Tuttle Capital Management LLC. “Obviously in an environment with the Fed pumping liquidity into the market it is hard to make money on the short side.”

“These days it is a lot easier,” he added. “Unfortunately for the shorts, markets don’t go down forever so they need to enjoy it while it lasts.”

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:41:15+00:00,Will Weakness in Lynas Rare Earths Limited's (ASX:LYC) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?,"Lynas Rare Earths (ASX:LYC) has had a rough three months with its share price down 21%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Lynas Rare Earths'  ROE today.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

Check out our latest analysis for Lynas Rare Earths

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lynas Rare Earths is:

22% = AU$273m ÷ AU$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.22 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

A Side By Side comparison of Lynas Rare Earths' Earnings Growth And 22% ROE

To start with, Lynas Rare Earths' ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Lynas Rare Earths' significant 52% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.

Story continues

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Lynas Rare Earths' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 26% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for LYC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.

Is Lynas Rare Earths Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Given that Lynas Rare Earths doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.

Conclusion

Overall, we are quite pleased with Lynas Rare Earths' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Gene Levoff, Apple’s former director of corporate law, pleaded guilty on Thursday to six counts of securities fraud between 2011 and 2016. Levoff, 48, was co-chairman of the company’s disclosure committee, which allowed him to see Apple’s revenue and earnings statements before they were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Levoff on several occasions made trades within quarterly blackout periods, even after telling other employees that they were prohibited from trading in Apple stock, according to federal prosecutors in New Jersey. He used the information to make $227,000 in profit and and to avoid losses of $377,000, according to the government.

“Gene Levoff betrayed the trust of one of the world’s largest tech companies for his own financial gain,” New Jersey US Attorney Vikas Khanna said in a statement. “Despite being responsible for enforcing Apple’s own ban on insider trading, Levoff used his position of trust to commit insider trading in order to line his own pockets.”

Levoff’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Stanford Law Grad

US District Judge William J. Martini in Newark, New Jersey set Levoff’s sentencing for Nov. 10. The charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, though he is unlikely to get that much time.

The Stanford Law School graduate, who joined Apple in 2008, was first charged in 2019. Apple fired him in September 2018 after placing him on leave two months earlier, according to a filing in a related lawsuit by the SEC. Over his decade-long career at Apple, he was one of the company’s most senior legal executives, reporting directly to the general counsel.

Story continues

Levoff last year tried to have the case thrown out as unconstitutional, arguing that no statute specifically bars insider trading. Prosecutors called his argument a bogus “Hail Mary,” and it was rejected by the judge.

The case is US v. Levoff, 19-cr-00780, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).

Sales of Class A Shares and Preferred Shares through the ATM Program will be made pursuant to the terms of an equity distribution agreement dated June 29, 2022 (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with RBC Capital Markets (the “Agent”).

Sales of Class A Shares and Preferred Shares will be made by way of “at-the-market distributions” as defined in National Instrument 44-102 Shelf Distributions on the TSX or on any marketplace for the Class A Shares and Preferred Shares in Canada. Since the Class A Shares and Preferred Shares will be distributed at the prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, prices may vary among purchasers during the period of distribution.

The maximum gross proceeds from the issuance of the shares will be $25,000,000 for each of the Class A and Preferred Shares.

The Company intends to use the proceeds from the ATM Program in accordance with the investment objectives and investment strategies of the Company, subject to the investment restrictions of the Company.

In addition, the Company may hold up to 10% of the total assets of the Portfolio in investments in global financial companies for the purpose of enhanced diversification and return potential.

The investment objectives for the Class A Shares are to provide holders with regular monthly cash distributions targeted to be at least $0.10 per Class A Share and to provide the opportunity for growth in the net asset value per Class A Share.

The investment objectives for the Preferred Shares are to provide holders with fixed cumulative preferential quarterly cash distributions, currently in the amount of $0.125 per Preferred Share, and to return the original issue price to holders of Preferred Shares on November 29, 2027.

The department also amended the Civil Nuclear Credit (CNC) program's guidance, revising the eligibility criteria that nuclear reactors ""not recover more than 50 percent of its costs from cost-of-service regulation or regulated contracts,"" which could affect the eligibility of reactors applying in the first round of funds awarded, the release said, without elaborating.

“The amended CNC Guidance supports the intent of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to keep the reactors online that sustain local economies and today provide our nation’s single largest source of carbon-free electricity,” Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, Dr. Kathryn Huff said in a press release.

Earlier on Tuesday, power utility PG&E Corp asked the U.S. Department of Energy for a 75-day extension to the deadline to apply for federal funds that could keep its California nuclear plant open. Two reactors at PG&E's Diablo Canyon plant are scheduled to shut down in 2024 and 2025.

The first round of awards prioritizes reactors that have announced their intention to cease operations, while future CNC award cycles —to be launched in the first quarter of 2023— will not be limited to nuclear reactors that have publicly announced intentions to close down, the release said.

Sale of undelivered Iveco Group N.V. common shares

London / Turin, 30th June 2022

CNH Industrial N.V. (CUSIP: N20944 109; ISIN: NL0010545661; TICKER: CNHI) and Iveco Group N.V. (ISIN: NL0015000LU4; TICKER: IVG) announce the final corporate activities related to the spin-off of CNH Industrial N.V.’s On-Highway business to Iveco Group N.V. (“the Demerger”), consummated on January 1, 2022.

As of 5pm Eastern Time on June 24, 2022, a number of CNH Industrial shareholders entitled to receive Iveco Group N.V. common shares (representing slightly over 1% of issued Iveco Group capital stock), as a result of the Demerger, failed to provide the details of a securities account with an intermediary of Monte Titoli S.p.A., to which the Iveco Group common shares (listed on Euronext Milan and only capable of being held and settled within the systems of Monte Titoli S.p.A.) could be delivered (“the Relevant CNHI Shareholders”, and the Iveco Group N.V. common shares they are entitled to, “the Undelivered IVG Shares”).

Therefore, as per the Demerger documentation, Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG has been appointed to sell the Undelivered IVG Shares on Euronext Milan, in accordance with regulations and market practices. At the end of such sales the total proceeds (net of all transaction costs, including brokerage, administration and foreign exchange fees) will be credited to the Relevant CNHI Shareholders, which will receive their pro rata portion of such aggregate proceeds (in US dollars), either by check or by wire transfer, to the extent they have timely provided Computershare Trust Co N.A. (the transfer agent of CNH Industrial N.V.) with their bank account details and the relevant conditions are met. The exact payment dates cannot be confirmed at this stage; however, in case the Relevant CNHI Shareholders do not receive payment by July 31, 2022, they are kindly invited to contact Computershare Trust Co N.A.

Additional information about the announced activities (namely the allocation of Iveco Group common shares to CNH Industrial shareholders and the settlement of the Undelivered IVG Shares), is available on the corporate website of Iveco Group N.V.

Vendita delle azioni ordinarie Iveco Group N.V. non consegnate

Londra / Torino, 30 giugno 2022

CNH Industrial N.V. (CUSIP: N20944 109; ISIN: NL0010545661; TICKER: CNHI) e Iveco Group N.V. (ISIN: NL0015000LU4; TICKER: IVG) annunciano le operazioni conclusive relative alla scissione di CNH Industrial N.V., mediante separazione e trasferimento del business On-Highway a Iveco Group N.V. (“la Scissione”), con efficacia dal 1° gennaio 2022.

Alle ore 17.00 (fuso orario della costa orientale degli Stati Uniti) del 24 giugno 2022, un certo numero di azionisti CNH Industrial aventi titolo a ricevere, per effetto della Scissione, azioni ordinarie Iveco Group N.V. (per una percentuale di poco superiore all’1% del capitale emesso da Iveco Group N.V.) è risultato aver omesso di fornire i dettagli di un conto deposito titoli presso un intermediario accreditato in Monte Titoli S.p.A., a cui consegnare le azioni ordinarie di Iveco Group N.V., quotate presso Euronext Milano e suscettibili di essere depositate e gestite esclusivamente in Monte Titoli S.p.A. (di seguito “gli Aventi Diritto CNHI”, e le azioni ordinarie Iveco Group N.V. a cui avevano titolo “le Azioni IVG Non Consegnate”).

Pertanto, come da documentazione di Scissione, Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG è stata incaricata di vendere su Euronext Milano le Azioni IVG Non Consegnate, come da disciplina e pratiche di mercato applicabili. Alla conclusione delle vendite i relativi proventi (al netto di tutti i costi, ivi inclusi commissioni di vendita, costi amministrativi e commissioni di cambio) saranno liquidati agli Aventi Diritto CNHI, che riceveranno la quota di spettanza di detti proventi complessivi (in dollari statunitensi), a mezzo assegno o a mezzo bonifico, là dove abbiano fornito tempestivamente i propri riferimenti bancari a Computershare Trust Co N.A. (in qualità di transfer agent di CNH Industrial N.V.), al verificarsi delle condizioni previste. Allo stato, non è possibile definire con precisione le date di pagamento; peraltro, in caso di mancato pagamento entro il 31 luglio 2022, gli Aventi Diritto CNHI sono invitati a prendere contatto con Computershare Trust Co N.A.

Ulteriori informazioni sulle operazioni qui riguardate (in particolare l’assegnazione delle azioni ordinarie Iveco Group agli azionisti di CNH Industrial e la liquidazione delle Azioni IVG Non Consegnate) sono disponibili sul sito web di Iveco Group N.V.

Londra / Torino, 30 giugno 2022

CNH Industrial N.V. (CUSIP: N20944 109; ISIN: NL0010545661; TICKER: CNHI) e Iveco Group N.V. (ISIN: NL0015000LU4; TICKER: IVG) annunciano le operazioni conclusive relative alla scissione di CNH Industrial N.V., mediante separazione e trasferimento del business On-Highway a Iveco Group N.V. (“la Scissione”), con efficacia dal 1° gennaio 2022.

Alle ore 17.00 (fuso orario della costa orientale degli Stati Uniti) del 24 giugno 2022, un certo numero di azionisti CNH Industrial aventi titolo a ricevere, per effetto della Scissione, azioni ordinarie Iveco Group N.V. (per una percentuale di poco superiore all’1% del capitale emesso da Iveco Group N.V.) è risultato aver omesso di fornire i dettagli di un conto deposito titoli presso un intermediario accreditato in Monte Titoli S.p.A., a cui consegnare le azioni ordinarie di Iveco Group N.V., quotate presso Euronext Milano e suscettibili di essere depositate e gestite esclusivamente in Monte Titoli S.p.A. (di seguito “gli Aventi Diritto CNHI”, e le azioni ordinarie Iveco Group N.V. a cui avevano titolo “le Azioni IVG Non Consegnate”).

Pertanto, come da documentazione di Scissione, Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG è stata incaricata di vendere su Euronext Milano le Azioni IVG Non Consegnate, come da disciplina e pratiche di mercato applicabili. Alla conclusione delle vendite i relativi proventi (al netto di tutti i costi, ivi inclusi commissioni di vendita, costi amministrativi e commissioni di cambio) saranno liquidati agli Aventi Diritto CNHI, che riceveranno la quota di spettanza di detti proventi complessivi (in dollari statunitensi), a mezzo assegno o a mezzo bonifico, là dove abbiano fornito tempestivamente i propri riferimenti bancari a Computershare Trust Co N.A. (in qualità di transfer agent di CNH Industrial N.V.), al verificarsi delle condizioni previste. Allo stato, non è possibile definire con precisione le date di pagamento; peraltro, in caso di mancato pagamento entro il 31 luglio 2022, gli Aventi Diritto CNHI sono invitati a prendere contatto con Computershare Trust Co N.A.

Ulteriori informazioni sulle operazioni qui riguardate (in particolare l’assegnazione delle azioni ordinarie Iveco Group agli azionisti di CNH Industrial e la liquidazione delle Azioni IVG Non Consegnate) sono disponibili sul sito web di Iveco Group N.V.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: we have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by supply chain issues as a result of the global semiconductor supply shortage; we face substantial competition and that competition is likely to increase over time; if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers and listeners, or convert listeners into subscribers, are not successful, our business will be adversely affected; we engage in extensive marketing efforts and the continued effectiveness of those efforts is an important part of our business; we rely on third parties for the operation of our business, and the failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business; we may not realize the benefits of acquisitions and other strategic investments and initiatives; the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced significant uncertainty to our business; a substantial number of our Sirius XM service subscribers periodically cancel their subscriptions and we cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers; our ability to profitably attract and retain subscribers to our Sirius XM service as our marketing efforts reach more price-sensitive consumers is uncertain; our business depends in part on the auto industry; failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business; our Sirius XM service may experience harmful interference from wireless operations; our Pandora ad-supported business has suffered a substantial and consistent loss of monthly active users, which may adversely affect our Pandora business; our failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our Pandora ad-supported service could harm our business; if we are unable to maintain revenue growth from our advertising products our results of operations will be adversely affected; changes in mobile operating systems and browsers may hinder our ability to sell advertising and market our services; if we fail to accurately predict and play music, comedy or other content that our Pandora listeners enjoy, we may fail to retain existing and attract new listeners; privacy and data security laws and regulations may hinder our ability to market our services, sell advertising and impose legal liabilities; consumer protection laws and our failure to comply with them could damage our business; failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business; if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer; interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business; the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties; our Pandora services depend upon maintaining complex licenses with copyright owners, and these licenses contain onerous terms; the rates we must pay for ""mechanical rights"" to use musical works on our Pandora service have increased substantially and these new rates may adversely affect our business; failure to protect our intellectual property or actions by third parties to enforce their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results; some of our services and technologies may use ""open source"" software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code subject to those licenses; rapid technological and industry changes and new entrants could adversely impact our services; we have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our debt contains certain covenants that restrict our operations; we are a ""controlled company"" within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements; while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time; our principal stockholder has significant influence, including over actions requiring stockholder approval, and its interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock; if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed; our facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities; the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition; we may be exposed to liabilities that other entertainment service providers would not customarily be subject to; and our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2022, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and available at the SEC's Internet site (http://www.sec.gov).

Sale of undelivered Iveco Group N.V. common shares

London / Turin, June 30, 2022

CNH Industrial N.V. (CUSIP: N20944 109; ISIN: NL0010545661; TICKER: CNHI) and Iveco Group N.V. (ISIN: NL0015000LU4; TICKER: IVG) announce the final corporate activities related to the spin-off of CNH Industrial N.V.’s On-Highway business to Iveco Group N.V. (“the Demerger”), consummated on January 1, 2022.

As of 5:00 pm Eastern Time on June 24, 2022, a number of CNH Industrial shareholders entitled to receive Iveco Group N.V. common shares (representing slightly over 1% of issued Iveco Group capital stock), as a result of the Demerger, failed to provide the details of a securities account with an intermediary of Monte Titoli S.p.A., to which the Iveco Group common shares (listed on Euronext Milan and only capable of being held and settled within the systems of Monte Titoli S.p.A.) could be delivered (“the Relevant CNHI Shareholders”, and the Iveco Group N.V. common shares they are entitled to, “the Undelivered IVG Shares”).

Therefore, as per the Demerger documentation, Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG has been appointed to sell the Undelivered IVG Shares on Euronext Milan, in accordance with regulations and market practices. At the end of such sales the total proceeds (net of all transaction costs, including brokerage, administration and foreign exchange fees) will be credited to the Relevant CNHI Shareholders, which will receive their pro rata portion of such aggregate proceeds (in US dollars), either by check or by wire transfer, to the extent they have timely provided Computershare Trust Co N.A. (the transfer agent of CNH Industrial N.V.) with their bank account details and the relevant conditions are met. The exact payment dates cannot be confirmed at this stage; however, in case the Relevant CNHI Shareholders do not receive payment by July 31, 2022, they are kindly invited to contact Computershare Trust Co N.A.

Additional information about the announced activities (namely the allocation of Iveco Group common shares to CNH Industrial shareholders and the settlement of the Undelivered IVG Shares), is available on the corporate website of Iveco Group N.V.

""The 2021 Annual Review & ESG Report and 2021 TCFD Report reflect key milestones as we fulfill Regions’ mission to make life better for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders.""-John Turner, President and CEO, Regions Financial Corp. (Graphic: Business Wire)

""The 2021 Annual Review & ESG Report and 2021 TCFD Report reflect key milestones as we fulfill Regions’ mission to make life better for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders,"" said John Turner, President and CEO of Regions Financial Corp. ""We’re proud to share our progress and our ongoing priorities in key areas of customer and community support, prudent and effective governance and environmental sustainability. Further, these reports illustrate key elements of our strong corporate culture, including sound risk management; fostering greater diversity, equity and inclusion; supporting associate well-being; advancing learning and development and prioritizing business ethics.""

The 2021 Annual Review & ESG Report, titled ""A Strong Foundation,"" combines details about the bank’s financial and ESG performance in one document. This latest version also includes Regions’ Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) disclosure, 2021 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index and 2021 Workforce Demographics (EEO-1) Index. Previously, these disclosures were released separately; with the consolidation of these disclosures, along with the latest TCFD release, the majority of Regions’ ESG disclosures are being issued simultaneously.

Story continues

Highlights from the 2021 Annual Review & ESG Report include:

Business: The report provides an overview of Regions’ solid performance in 2021, including the acquisitions of EnerBank, Sabal Capital Partners, LLC, and Clearsight Advisors, Inc., as well as Regions’ focus on making banking easier through investments in technology and digital capabilities. Governance: Regions’ values-based governance strives to ensure its business is conducted according to the highest ethical standards, from the company’s Board of Directors to associates, suppliers and vendors. The 2021 report announces enhancements to ESG governance, including the creation of the ESG Leadership Council, a cross-functional decision-making body that reports to Regions’ Executive Leadership Team. Planet: Regions’ environmental strategy is explained, including updates to performance on Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and how the company is measuring and evaluating Scope 3 portfolio emissions, which are emissions resulting from activities of assets not owned or controlled by Regions. Regions actively works to identify climate-related opportunities. This includes supporting customers by providing sustainable investing and financing opportunities related to their transition to a more sustainable future. People: The report tracks Regions’ performance related to associates, customers and communities. Highlights include the commitment of Regions Bank and the Regions Foundation in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights; supplier diversity; associate engagement; community support and talent recruitment and development. Prosperity: The report provides details about Regions’ offerings of products and services that respond to a wide variety of customers and prospects and their changing needs, as well as new and updated financial wellness programs and significant community investments.

Regions’ 2021 TCFD Report reveals progress toward the bank’s climate strategy, which is built on three pillars: supporting Regions’ customers in the transition to a lower-carbon economy, reducing the environmental footprint of operations and managing climate-related risks. Highlights include:

Supporting Customers: Regions’ bankers continue to offer innovative sustainable finance products to promote clean energy solutions for clients, such as EnerBank’s point-of-sale financing for energy-efficient home improvement projects. Environmental Footprint: The bank achieved its 2023 energy use goal early (in 2021) and continues to monitor performance to ensure ongoing reductions. Progress is also being made toward the new gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions goal, which was updated in last year’s TCFD Report to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030 against a 2019 baseline. Regions continues to implement new and innovative energy-efficient approaches within existing and new facilities to help reach this goal. Managing Climate-related Risks: Regions continues to advance environmental and risk-related efforts to execute climate-connected initiatives, including developing new analytical capabilities to strengthen the bank’s evaluation of transitional and physical risks in its portfolio. Geospatial analysis enhancements are enabling more precise analysis of sea level rise, which helps assess potential risks to Regions’ facilities and those of its customers.

""We know that our stakeholders are increasingly interested in Regions’ ESG priorities, and we’re constantly looking for opportunities to improve the timing and content of our ESG-related disclosures to provide that information,"" said Regions Chief Governance Officer Andrew Nix. ""With the broad overview provided by our Annual Review & ESG Report, including our SASB disclosure, GRI Index and Workforce Demographics Index, and the deeper dive on climate provided by our TCFD Report, this coordinated release provides a holistic view of the work that we’re doing to advance our ESG priorities for all of our stakeholders.""

1The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per share.

Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s current distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan.

BKT and BBN have adopted a Plan whereby the Fund will make fixed monthly distributions to common stockholders and will distribute all available net income to its stockholders, consistent with its investment objective and as required by the Code. The fixed amount distributed per share is subject to change at the discretion of BKT and BBN’s Board. If sufficient net income is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. BKT and BBN are currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act""). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. BKT and BBN may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act.

BKT and BBN’s estimated sources of the distributions paid as of June 30th, 2022 and for its current fiscal year are as follows:

Estimated Allocations as of June 30, 2022 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital BKT $0.029400 $0.019593 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.009807 (33%) BBN $0.122900 $0.100090 (81%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.022810 (19%)

Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through June 30, 2022 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital BKT $0.167000 $0.095496 (57%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.071504 (43%) BBN $0.614500 $0.595445 (97%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.019055 (3%)

The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon BKT and BBN’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. BKT and BBN will send its stockholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will illustrate how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Fund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Fund Average annual total return (in relation to NAV) for the 5-year period ending on 5/31/2022 Annualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of 5/31/2022 Cumulative total return (in relation to NAV) for the fiscal year through 5/31/2022 Cumulative fiscal year distributions as a percentage of NAV as 5/31/2022 BKT 0.46% 7.08% (9.34)% 2.76% BBN 2.83% 7.55% (20.91)% 2.52%

No conclusions should be drawn about BKT or BBN’s investment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s Plan.

The amount distributed per share under a Plan is subject to change at the discretion of the applicable Fund’s Board. Each Plan will be subject to ongoing review by the Board to determine whether the Plan should be continued, modified or terminated. The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund’s shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders. The amendment or termination of a Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:30:00+00:00,NEUBERGER BERMAN REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND ANNOUNCES MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION,"NEW YORK, June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (NYSE American: NRO) (the ""Fund"") has announced a distribution declaration of $0.0312 per share of common stock. The distribution announced today is payable on July 29, 2022, has a record date of July 15, 2022 and has an ex-date of July 14, 2022. Neuberger Berman Logo (PRNewsFoto/Neuberger Berman Group LLC)

Under its level distribution policy, the Fund anticipates that it will make regular monthly distributions, subject to market conditions, of $0.0312 per share of common stock, unless further action is taken to determine another amount. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay a distribution of any particular amount, or that a distribution will consist of only net investment income. The Fund's ability to maintain its current distribution rate will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and stability of income received from its investments, availability of capital gains, the amount of leverage employed by the Fund, the cost of leverage and the level of other Fund fees and expenses.

Under its level distribution policy, the Fund anticipates that it will make regular monthly distributions, subject to market conditions, of $0.0905 per share of common stock, unless further action is taken to determine another amount.  The Fund's ability to maintain its current distribution rate will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and stability of income received from its investments, the cost of leverage and the level of other Fund fees and expenses. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay a distribution of any particular amount or that a distribution will consist only of net investment income.

Due to an effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, the distribution announced today, as well as future distributions, may consist of net investment income, net realized capital gains and return of capital. In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income.

(NYSE American: NML) (the ""Fund"") has announced a distribution declaration of $0.0206 per share of common stock. The distribution announced today is payable on July 29, 2022, has a record date of July 15, 2022 and has an ex-date of July 14, 2022. Neuberger Berman Logo (PRNewsFoto/Neuberger Berman Group LLC)

The Fund currently intends to make regular monthly cash distributions to holders of its common stock at a fixed rate per share, to be determined based on the projected net rate of return of the Fund's investments as well as other factors, subject to ongoing review and adjustment from time to time.  The Fund currently intends to pay its regular monthly distributions out of its distributable cash flow, which generally consists of (1) cash and paid-in-kind distributions from master limited partnerships (""MLPs"") or their affiliates, dividends from common stocks, interest from debt instruments and income from other investments held by the Fund less (2) current or accrued operating expenses, including leverage costs, if any, and taxes on its taxable income.

The Fund expects that a portion of its distributions to stockholders will constitute a non-taxable return of capital. A ""return of capital"" is a distribution by the Fund which represents a return of a common stockholder's original investment, and should not be confused with a dividend.  To the extent the Fund pays a return of capital, a common stockholder's basis in Fund shares will be reduced, which will increase a capital gain or reduce a capital loss upon sale of those shares.  There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay a distribution of any particular amount, or that a distribution will consist solely of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits.

In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. The notice would be for informational purposes and not for tax reporting purposes, and would disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distribution, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions paid in 2022 will be made after the end of the year.

Story continues

The Fund is subject to federal income tax on its taxable income, unlike most investment companies. Any taxes paid by the Fund will reduce the amount available to pay distributions to stockholders, and therefore investors in the Fund will likely receive lower distributions than if they invested directly in MLPs.

Throughout this release, we make a number of ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided under these sections. As the words imply, these are statements about future sales, earnings, cash flow, results of operations, uses of cash, financings, share repurchases, ability to meet deleveraging goals, and other measures of financial performance or potential future plans or events, strategies, objectives, beliefs, prospects, assumptions, expectations, and projected costs or savings or transactions of the Company that might or might not happen in the future, as contrasted with historical information. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but by their very nature are subject to a wide range of risks.

Words that could indicate that we are making forward-looking statements include the following:

intend believe plan expect may goal would project become pursue estimate will forecast continue could anticipate target encourage promise improve progress potential should impact

This is not an exhaustive list, but is intended to give you an idea of how we try to identify forward-looking statements. The absence of any of these words, however, does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking.

Here is the key point: Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, and actual results or events could differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statements. Any number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause our performance to differ significantly from what is described in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: risks related to the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine (referred to herein as the ""Ukraine War"") and resulting geopolitical instability and uncertainty, which could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions, in addition to the potential effect of supply chain disruptions that could adversely affect profitability; the impact of contagious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the escalation thereof due to variant strains of the virus and the societal, governmental, and individual responses thereto, including supply chain disruption, loss of contracts and/or customers, erosion of some customers' credit quality, downgrades of the Company's credit quality, closure or temporary interruption of the Company's or suppliers' manufacturing facilities, travel, shipping and logistical disruptions, domestic and international general economic conditions, such as inflation, exchange rates and interest rates; loss of human capital or personnel, and general economic calamities; increased costs, poor quality, or unavailability of raw materials or certain outsourced services and supply chain disruptions; increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers as well as labor shortages; the risk of business disruptions associated with information technology, cyber-attacks, or catastrophic losses affecting infrastructure; risks that the integration of Milacron disrupts current operations or poses potential difficulties in employee retention or otherwise affects financial or operating results; the ability to recognize the benefits of the acquisition of Milacron or any other acquisition or disposition, including potential synergies and cost savings or the failure of the Company or any acquired company to achieve its plans and objectives generally; impairment charges to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets; competition in the industries in which we operate; impacts of decreases in demand or changes in technological advances, laws, or regulation on the revenues that we derive from the plastics industry; our reliance upon employees, agents, and business partners to comply with laws in many countries and jurisdictions; the impact of incurring significant amounts of indebtedness and any inability of the Company to respond to changes in its business or make future desirable acquisitions; the ability of the Company to comply with financial or other covenants in its debt agreements; global market and economic conditions, including those related to the financial markets; our level of international sales and operations; cyclical demand for industrial capital goods; the dependence of our business units on relationships with several large customers and providers; the impact to the Company's effective tax rate of changes in the mix of earnings or tax laws and certain other tax-related matters; involvement in claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings related to operations; uncertainty in the United States political and regulatory environment or global trade policy; adverse foreign currency fluctuations; labor disruptions; and the effect of certain provisions of the Company's governing documents and Indiana law that could decrease the trading price of the Company's common stock. Shareholders, potential investors, and other readers are urged to consider these risks and uncertainties in evaluating forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.

Stock Doomsayers Vindicated in Historic First Half: Markets Wrap US Will Face High Gas Prices ‘as Long as It Takes,’ Biden Says The Wheels Have Come Off Electric Vehicles Democrats Weigh Paring Biden Tax Hike to Win Over Manchin Supreme Court Crimps Biden’s Climate Agenda With Limits on EPA

The iShares MSCI China ETF (ticker MCHI) lured $333 million on Wednesday, its largest single-day inflow since the fund’s inception in 2011. The $8.5 billion ETF, which mostly invests in shares of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, finished the month up almost 8% Bloomberg data show.

As central bankers around the world raise interest rates to tamp down rising inflation, stocks have paid the price. Fears of a looming recession sent US shares down 21% in the first six months of 2022-- their worst first half since 1970, while European stocks had their worst start to the year since the global financial crisis. Chinese shares, in contrast, have surged in recent weeks, as policy makers dial back months of stringent virus curbs, deleveraging efforts and punishing regulatory and antitrust campaigns against the private sector.

“It speaks to the bottom fishing going on, and the desire to allocate to any asset that is actually going up in this environment,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas Securities. “China is basically zigging, while global equities zag.”

Whether the recent rally can continue remains uncertain, Sohn said, particularly if the country dials back its moves to ease Covid-19 restrictions.

Still, most investors remain upbeat. A recent Bloomberg survey of 19 fund managers and analysts shows that they expect benchmark stock gauges in China and Hong Kong to post gains of at least 4% by year-end, outperforming their global peers.

As for MCHI, it hasn’t seen a single day of redemptions this year. In fact, four out of the five largest one-day flows into the fund have occurred in 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Anthony Rayar.

More than four decades later, JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief investment officer says the economic outlook today looks even worse -- with a US recession now looking more likely than a soft landing.

Central banks are a long way from reversing the most flagrant excesses of the easy-money era while inflation looks ever-more entrenched, per Michele.

His pessimism is reflected in an historically bad first half of a year that’s just drawn to a close. Stocks and bonds around the world combined have fallen by the most on record, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1990, with $8 trillion wiped off the S&P 500 alone.

“This current period is no doubt the most challenging in my career,” Michele said in an interview. “You are stuck with a lot of liquidity in the system and rates that look ridiculously low relative to the levels of growth and inflation that we are seeing and where employment is.”

With books now closed, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen nearly 30% in the first half while the MSCI World Index has shed more than 20%.

There have been few safe spaces while sanguine predictions heading into the year have misfired. The 10-year yield, a key benchmark for mortgages, corporate debt and the valuation of equities, has more than doubled this year from 1.5% to a recent high of around 3.5%, a level last seen in 2011. In December, economists saw the US 10-year Treasury yield hitting 2% by the end of 2022.

“What surprised markets was inflation and it has been the driver year to date,” said Erin Browne, a fund manager at Pacific Investment Management Co.

What’s more, the slump in cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin to Ethereum, has wiped out trillions in value combined from once high-flying digital tokens -- an asset class almost absent in past crises.

“Many people have been caught up in the crypto craze,” Mark Mobius, partner and co-founder of Mobius Capital Partners, said in an interview. “This is creating a real problem in the financial market because it’s having a very big impact on sentiment. It’s a very unusual and challenging situation.”

Commodities were the only outperformers as the Russia-Ukraine war hit supply.

The question now is whether dip buyers will be rewarded as valuations plunge -- or if a brewing economic downturn and supply-side-driven price pressures will intensify the cross-asset selloff.

Stock strategists are still seemingly bullish. Oppenheimer’s John Stoltzfus sees the S&P 500 ending 2022 at 5,330, requiring a roughly 40% rally in the next six months. A handful of others, including JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG, have targets that require the index to rebound at least 30% to be met. Wall Street strategists, on average, see the S&P 500 gaining more than 20% in the latest Bloomberg survey.

Nonetheless there’s likely to be less lasting damage inflicted by any inflation-driven recession than in 2008’s credit crisis, which sparked a profit decline of 57%, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer Lisa Shalett wrote in a note this week.

But if Michele is right about the dim prospects for a soft landing, risk assets like stocks and credit could do even worse.

Investors have already yanked more than $6.7 billion from the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF over the last six months, the biggest semi-annual outflows since its 2007 inception, according to Bloomberg data.

The bond market in particular is struggling to decide what to worry about more: high inflation, or emerging recession fears. US Treasuries have rallied in recent days amid recession fears, bringing down 10-year yields to near 3%.

Michele, who’s endured every rout from Black Monday and the dot-com crash to the 2008 crisis, remains skeptical of the signals in fixed income that price pressures are ebbing. Unlike some peers, he’s staying short on duration in his bond portfolios and isn’t ready to give up his guard on inflation.

“We had gone through recessions, deep and shallow, and we recovered. What we are learning is that high inflation expectations when they are entrenched can become destructive,” he said. “And the central banks now have to scramble to try to get that out of system while trying to engineer a soft landing. Stagflation and recession look more likely to us than soft-landing.”

Democrats Weigh Paring Biden Tax Hike to Win Over Manchin The Wheels Have Come Off Electric Vehicles Supreme Court Crimps Biden’s Climate Agenda With Limits on EPA Stock Doomsayers Vindicated in Historic First Half: Markets Wrap Trump’s Final Scene Didn’t Go According to Script

Sales will be about $7.2 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, Micron said in a statement Thursday. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $9.14 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding certain items, profit will be about $1.63 a share, the company said, well short of the $2.57 predicted by analysts.

The outlook reflects a slowdown for two key markets for Micron’s memory chips: computers and smartphones. Consumers and businesses have been reining in spending amid concern that the major world economies are headed for recession.

“Recently, the industry demand environment has weakened, and we are taking action to moderate our supply growth in fiscal 2023,” Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in the statement. That means the company plans to use stockpiles to fill orders, rather than increasing its production, and will spend less on new plants and equipment.

Micron’s shares fell more than 8% in extended trading following the report, before recovering somewhat to a decline of about 3%. They had already lost 41% this year through the close, part of a rout for semiconductor stocks that had rallied over the last five years.

In the three months ended June 2, Micron’s revenue grew 16% to $8.64 billion, its smallest increase in more than a year. Net income was $2.63 billion, or $2.34 a share. Profit and sales were roughly in line with analysts’ predictions.

Micron’s memory chips perform a crucial role in electronic devices -- one that’s grown as the amount of data generated has accelerated. And Mehrotra has argued that more money will flow to its category of chips as that trend continues.

The US company competes with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., as well as Japan’s Kioxia Holdings Corp., in a market that has historically been perilous and unpredictable. Many of their products are sold as interchangeable commodities, which can suffer rapid price fluctuations -- sometimes trading for less than they cost to produce.

DRAM chips hold information temporarily, helping processors crunch data. Nand flash memory, meanwhile, acts as permanent storage in phones and computers. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is a smaller contender to Samsung in both types of chips, with the South Korean company dominating the industry.

In the three months ended June 2, Micron’s revenue grew 16% to $8.64 billion, its smallest increase in more than a year. Net income was $2.63 billion, or $2.34 a share. Profit and sales were roughly in line with analysts’ predictions.

Micron’s memory chips perform a crucial role in electronic devices -- one that’s grown as the amount of data generated has accelerated. And Mehrotra has argued that more money will flow to its category of chips as that trend continues.

The US company competes with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., as well as Japan’s Kioxia Holdings Corp., in a market that has historically been perilous and unpredictable. Many of their products are sold as interchangeable commodities, which can suffer rapid price fluctuations -- sometimes trading for less than they cost to produce.

DRAM chips hold information temporarily, helping processors crunch data. Nand flash memory, meanwhile, acts as permanent storage in phones and computers. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is a smaller contender to Samsung in both types of chips, with the South Korean company dominating the industry.

* U.S. May consumer spending rises moderately; inflation stays hot

* Nasdaq notches biggest-ever Jan-June percentage drop

* Indexes down: Dow 0.82%, S&P 0.88%, Nasdaq 1.33% (Updates with official closing prices)

By Stephen Culp

NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Thursday, crossing the finish line of a grim month and quarter, a dismal coda to the S&P 500's worst first half in more than half a century.

All three major U.S. stock indexes finished the month and the second quarter in negative territory, with the S&P 500 notching its steepest first-half percentage drop since 1970.

The Nasdaq had its largest-ever January-June percentage drop, while the Dow suffered its biggest first-half percentage plunge since 1962.

All three indexes posted their second straight quarterly declines. The last time that happened was in 2015 for the S&P and the Dow, and 2016 for the Nasdaq.

The year began with spiking cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant. Then came Russia's invasion of Ukraine, decades-high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which have stoked fears of a possible recession.

""All year it’s been a tug-of-war between inflation and slowing growth, balancing tightening financial conditions to address inflation concerns but trying to avoid outright panic,"" said Paul Kim, chief executive officer at Simplify ETFs in New York. ""I think we are more than likely already in a recession and right now the only question is how harsh will the recession be?""

""I think it’s very unlikely that we’ll see a soft landing,"" Kim added.

Economic data released on Thursday did little to allay those fears. Disposable income inched lower, consumer spending decelerated, inflation remained hot and jobless claims inched higher.

""We’ve started to see a slowdown in consumer spending,"" Said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""And it seems that inflation is taking its toll on the average consumer and that translates to corporate earnings which is what ultimately drives the stock market.""

The graphic below shows year-on-year growth of core inflation indicators, all of which suggest that while a peak appears to have been reached in March, they all continue to soar well above the Fed's average annual 2% target:

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 253.88 points, or 0.82%, to 30,775.43, the S&P 500 lost 33.45 points, or 0.88%, to 3,785.38 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 149.16 points, or 1.33%, to 11,028.74.

Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors ended down, with utilities leading the gainers and energy notching the largest percentage drop.

But energy was to only major sector to post a year-to-date gain, aided by crude prices spiking over supply concerns due to Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The major stock indexes lost ground in June, with the S&P 500 logging its largest June percentage decline since the financial crisis.

Second-quarter reporting season begins in several weeks, and 130 of the companies in the S&P 500 have pre-announced. Of those, 45 have been positive and 77 have been negative, resulting in a negative/positive ratio of 1.7 stronger than the first quarter but weaker than a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

Worries over inflation dampening consumer demand and threatening profit margins will have market participants listening closely to forward guidance.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc fell 7.3% as its quarterly profit plunged 76%, hurt by its opioid settlement with Florida and a decrease in U.S. pharmacy sales on waning demand for COVID-19 vaccinations.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 42 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 367 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.58 billion shares, compared with the 12.86 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:22:10+00:00,Companies say they'll help employees access abortion. Are they serious about it?,"Starbucks is among the companies promising to help employees seeking abortions to travel to states where they remain legal. But experts say employers must do more than pay for travel to make reproductive care a meaningful benefit. (David Zalubowski / Associated Press)

After the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, a wide swath of corporate America came out with a message for its workforce: We will pay to help you get an abortion in a place where it's still available.

From banking to technology to entertainment, executives vowed to support access to the procedure, some pledging as much as $10,000 to cover employees' travel for abortion care. But it wasn't immediately clear how any of this would work in practice.

Would a worker have to tell their employer that they needed an abortion to secure travel reimbursement funds? How would companies ensure workers' privacy? What would they do to protect employees — and themselves — from potential legal attacks, such as those made possible by a Texas law that allows private citizens to sue anyone who “aids and abets” abortion? Would part-time workers and contract workers be covered? And would companies fight to restore the legal status of abortion in the places where it has been lost?

So far, the companies making the promises don't seem to have a lot of answers.

""The worst thing you can do is promise your employees a benefit and then have no plan to make sure you can actually provide it,"" said Sonja Spoo, director of reproductive rights campaigns at Ultraviolet, a national gender justice advocacy organization. ""Don’t wait until a law passes to figure out what you’re going to do. Start figuring it out now.""

Experts and reproductive health advocates said that the new in-house travel reimbursement programs announced by many companies will require erecting safeguards around employee privacy. Without the right ones in place, some doubted that the benefit would be widely used — if at all.

""I don’t know that people would feel comfortable calling someone up and saying, 'Hey, I would like to make use of this new abortion leave,'"" said Jen L’Estrange, the founder of Red Clover, a human resources firm.

Airbnb, Reddit, Snap, Netflix, Yelp, Wells Fargo, Microsoft, Rakuten, Starbucks and EBay are among major companies that said they would offer a travel benefit through their healthcare plans.

Story continues

L’Estrange said there were several things companies could do to ensure workers feel comfortable accessing reproductive care. One way would be the creation of what she termed a ""wellness policy"" that would help workers access out-of-state healthcare of all forms, including but not limited to abortion, and would include generous paid time off, including unplanned sick leave to give workers time to travel and recover. As part of that policy, L'Estrange said, companies could provide a stipend paid to workers at the beginning of the year, ""regardless of whether or not they use it.""

""I’d say take it away from the abortion question,"" said L'Estrange. ""You want knee surgery and you want to do it out of state? Great, we will support you in that.""

If companies are really serious about providing out-of-state care to workers, several reproductive rights advocates said, they will need to take action both inside and outside the office.

The Times asked more than a dozen companies that said they would cover out-of-state abortion care if they had a plan in place for defending against legal challenges, particularly in Texas. Airbnb, Reddit, Snap, Netflix, Microsoft, EBay, Wells Fargo, Dick's Sporting Goods, Starbucks, Amazon, Discord and Boeing didn't answer the question. Only Yelp and Rakuten responded directly.

""This is the right thing to do for our employees and we are not concerned about legal risk,"" a Yelp spokesperson said in a statement. ""With more than 200 employees in Texas, we felt it was important that they had consistent access to the health services they needed, no matter where they live.""

""I am unable to speculate on theoretical legal questions,"" a spokesperson for Rakuten said in a statement. ""While we do not have an office in Texas, we have about 70 remote employees in the state. We are committed to a unified employee experience where all of our team members can access and enjoy the same benefits, corporate culture, and career opportunities, regardless of where they live or any other identifying factor.""

Then there's the bigger question of whether the companies asserting their employees' right to reproductive healthcare are prepared to treat politics as a remedy, putting real money and force behind their promises.

Many supporters of reproductive healthcare called for corporations to use their powerful lobbying teams to fight to defeat anti-abortion bills in state legislatures and engage in other political pressure tactics.

""One thing corporations can and should do is try to fight back on this by saying we are not going to have jobs in your state, we will not have our conferences in your state,"" said Cary Franklin, law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the Center on Reproductive Health, Law and Policy. ""It’s not just states that have power over corporations. Corporations have leverage too.""

Advocates also said corporate political giving should be brought in line with public declarations of supporting employees' access to reproductive care.

Since 2020, American corporations have donated $195.4 million to anti-abortion lawmakers, according to Ultraviolet. In the South, where all three of the major Supreme Court abortion cases of the past decade originated, 79% of corporate political giving goes to anti-abortion lawmakers, the group found.

""You can’t on one hand fund these extremists and then beg forgiveness for your sins by paying for your folks to go out of state for care,"" said Spoo, of Ultraviolet. ""Corporate America’s contributions to anti-abortion politics have led us to this moment. They are absolutely on the hook for getting us out of it by pulling their funding from the politicians who are actively working to roll back our rights.""

Political action such as supporting candidates that favor Medicaid expansion would have the potential benefit of improving healthcare access for those who aren't covered through their jobs — a group that includes many part-time and contract workers at the companies that have announced new benefits.

Providing reproductive care that includes abortion supports workers' health and their careers, said Franklin, the UCLA law professor. ""But 75% of people in this country who get abortions are poor and low-income and they don’t work for major corporations. They don’t have jobs with Microsoft.""

Corporations paying for out-of-state reproductive care was ""fine"" but ""not the solution,"" said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Because so many women are left out of the equation, said Appelbaum, ""the best solution [for corporations] is to contribute to a reproductive healthcare fund.""

The Times asked companies if they had donated to such funds, but most didn't answer. A Yelp spokesperson said in a statement that the Yelp Foundation double-matched employee donations to organizations fighting anti-abortion legislation in Texas and elsewhere, as well as organizations like the Center for Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro Choice America, Lilith Fund, Planned Parenthood, and Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.

At the same time, Yelp Inc PAC has made political donations to anti-abortion Republicans including U.S. Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and John Boozman of Arkansas, Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Jerry Moran of Kansas and others, according to Open Secrets.

Appelbaum believes corporations will have a harder time hiring women in states were abortion is illegal. Workers want to know that they will have the healthcare they need in all kinds of scenarios — a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, for example, or an incomplete miscarriage that could lead to sepsis. It may not be clear until it's too late when ""life of the mother"" exceptions to abortion bans apply. ""Women will seek out companies in states where they don’t have to worry about this,"" said Appelbaum.

Ultimately, laws banning basic reproductive healthcare will lead to a situation in which ""the economies of those states will really suffer,"" said Appelbaum. ""Educated women who have options will not stay in those states. There will be a lot of people voting with their feet.""

Reportedly, Google’s recent addition of a Bluetooth menu to settings option in Nest Hub Max testifies the above-mentioned fact.

The Bluetooth menu item shows users the devices that were previously paired with the Nest Hub Max. The Bluetooth menu also shows other options like “Pair a new device” and “Use display as a Bluetooth speaker”.

With the recent capability, GOOGL aims to provide an enhanced experience to users. This is expected to boost the adoption rate of its smart displays, which in turn, might contribute to top-line growth.

Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus

Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote

This is likely to help Alphabet gain investors’ confidence in the near term and the long haul.

Shares of GOOGL have been down 22.8%, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 30.1% in the year-to-date period.

Efforts to Bolster Smart Displays

Apart from the latest move, GOOGL recently equipped the Nest Hub Max with the Fuchsia operating system.

Further, Alphabet rolled out the “Look and Talk” feature to the Nest Hub Max owners that allows the onboard camera to detect their glance and activate the microphone for commands without the “Hey Google” keyword.

Alphabet also improved the display experience and released three clock faces for smart displays. Additionally, GOOGL rolled out Zoom to the Nest Hub Max.

These initiatives are likely to help GOOGL penetrate the growing smart display market rapidly, which is expected to hit $18.25 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 21.6% during the 2021-2028 forecast period, per an Allied Market Research report.

Competitive Scenario

In this upbeat scenario, GOOGL faces intense competitive pressure from organizations like Amazon AMZN and Lenovo, which are making strong efforts to capitalize on the above-mentioned prospects.

Amazon offers powerful smart displays with the Echo Show series. AMZN’s latest launch Echo Show 15 is compatible with Alexa and can be fixed in portrait or landscape orientation. AMZN’s Echo Show 15 can be paired with other Echo devices to enjoy a higher quality audio.

Further, Lenovo smart display provides an enhanced visual experience to users. It is enabled with Google Assistant and designed for smart home applications. The underlined smart display runs on a simplified version of Google's Android mobile OS, Android Things.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:15:15+00:00,OM Holdings (ASX:OMH) Shareholders Will Want The ROCE Trajectory To Continue,"If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So on that note, OM Holdings (ASX:OMH) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.

What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for OM Holdings:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.14 = AU$136m ÷ (AU$1.3b - AU$314m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).

So, OM Holdings has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.7% generated by the Metals and Mining industry.

View our latest analysis for OM Holdings  roce

In the above chart we have measured OM Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering OM Holdings here  for free.

How Are Returns Trending?

OM Holdings' ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 856% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.

Our Take On OM Holdings' ROCE

To bring it all together, OM Holdings has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

Future events and actual results, performance, transactions or achievements, financial or otherwise, may differ materially from the results, performance, transactions or achievements, financial or otherwise, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

Currently, one of the most significant factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ significantly from our forward-looking statements is the adverse effect of the current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, including possible resurgences, variants and mutations, on the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance of the Company and its tenants, the real estate market and the global economy and financial markets. Moreover, investors are cautioned to interpret many of the risks identified under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

These informational notices provide further details on the sources of the funds’ regular monthly or quarterly distributions and follows the most recent monthly and quarterly distribution announcements. The full text of these notices is available below or on the Nuveen website via Distribution Source Estimates.

Important Information Regarding Distributions

June 30, 2022: THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. NO ACTION IS REQUIRED ON YOUR PART. If you would like to receive this notice and other shareholder information electronically, please visit www.investordelivery.com if you receive distributions and statements from your financial advisor or brokerage account. An electronic copy of this notice is also posted under distribution notices at www.nuveen.com/cef.

This notice provides shareholders with information regarding fund distributions, as required by current securities laws. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution Policy.

The following table provides estimates of the Funds’ distribution sources, reflecting year-to-date cumulative experience through the month-end prior to the latest distribution. The Funds attribute these estimates equally to each regular distribution throughout the year. Consequently, the estimated information as of the specified month-end shown below is for the current distribution, and also represents an updated estimate for all prior months in the year. It is estimated that NDMO, JRI and NPCT have distributed more than their income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the distributions may be (and is shown below as being estimated to be) a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income.""

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Funds’ investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. More details about each Fund’s distributions and the basis for these estimates are available on www.nuveen.com/cef.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:15:00+00:00,Liberty Media Corporation Announces Quarterly Interest Payment and Excess Regular Additional Distribution on 2.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures Due 2048,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Liberty Media Corporation (""Liberty"") (NASDAQ: LSXMA, LSXMB, LSXMK, FWONA, FWONK, BATRA, BATRK) today announced the payment of a quarterly interest payment and an Excess Regular Additional Distribution to the holders as of June 15, 2022 of its 2.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048 (the ""Debentures""). The amount of the quarterly interest payment is $5.3125 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures, and the amount of the Excess Regular Additional Distribution is $1.3668 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures. As of June 30, 2022, the aggregate adjusted principal amount outstanding is approximately $387 million, after giving effect to today’s quarterly interest payment. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Indenture for the Debentures.

Under the Indenture for the Debentures, the original principal amount of the Debentures is reduced in an amount equal to each Extraordinary Additional Distribution that is made to holders of the Debentures. Thereafter, the adjusted principal amount is further reduced on each successive quarterly interest payment date to the extent necessary to cause the quarterly interest payment to represent the payment of an annualized yield of 2.125% of the adjusted principal amount. This latter adjustment, to the extent it is made by reason of a particular Extraordinary Additional Distribution that results in a reduction to the principal amount of the Debentures, takes effect on the second succeeding interest payment date after the payment of that Extraordinary Additional Distribution.

To date, Liberty has made one Extraordinary Additional Distribution to holders of the Debentures. As previously announced, on March 4, 2022, Liberty made an Extraordinary Additional Distribution of $31.1731 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures, which was attributable to the special cash dividend paid on February 25, 2022 by Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (""SIRI"") to holders of its common stock of record as of the close of business on February 11, 2022.

Story continues

Reductions to the principal amount of the Debentures do not affect the amount of the quarterly interest payments received by holders of the Debentures, which will continue to be a rate equal to 2.125% per annum of the original principal amount of the Debentures. Below is a detail of the amount of the quarterly interest payment being made on the Debentures, its allocation between payment of interest and repayment of principal and the revised adjusted principal amount of the Debentures resulting from such payment, per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures:

June 30, 2022
Beginning Adjusted
Principal Payment Interest Payment of
Principal June 30, 2022
Ending Adjusted
Principal $968.8269 $5.3125 $5.1469 $0.1656 $968.6613

Liberty is also making an Excess Regular Additional Distribution to holders of the Debentures as of June 15, 2022 of $1.3668 per Debenture, which is attributable to the regular quarterly dividend paid by SIRI of $0.0219615 per share on May 25, 2022. The payment of the Excess Regular Additional Distribution will not result in a reduction to the adjusted principal amount of the Debentures.

The quarterly interest payment and Excess Regular Additional Distribution are expected to be made on June 30, 2022 to holders of record of the Debentures as of June 15, 2022.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:15:00+00:00,Geron Corporation Announces Expansion of Existing Loan Facility,"Up to $50 Million in Additional Non-Dilutive Capital Potentially Available in 2023

FOSTER CITY, Calif., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Geron Corporation (Nasdaq: GERN), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company, today announced an amendment to expand its existing loan facility with Hercules Capital, Inc. (NYSE: HTGC) and Silicon Valley Bank, from up to $75 million to up to $125 million.

""This expansion of our debt facility provides potential access of up to $50 million in additional non-dilutive capital in 2023, the year in which we expect top-line results from the Phase 3 IMerge trial in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes in early January, and if the data are supportive, U.S. and EU regulatory filings thereafter,"" said Olivia K. Bloom, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ""We believe these potential additional debt proceeds, when added to our current financial resources and the projected proceeds from exercises of currently outstanding warrants in 2023, will be sufficient to fund our projected level of operations, which includes preparatory activities for potential U.S. commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS, until the middle of 2024. Maintaining a strong balance sheet during this critical time period provides important financial and strategic optionality as Geron transforms from late-stage development to a commercial entity.""

Of the aggregate $125 million loan facility, $50 million is currently outstanding. The remaining $75 million is potentially available to Geron in four tranches. The first tranche of $20 million is available until September 15, 2023, subject to the achievement of certain clinical and financial milestones. The second tranche of $10 million is available to the Company through December 15, 2023, subject to the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones, and satisfaction of certain capitalization requirements. The third tranche of $20 million is available to the Company from September 15, 2023 until September 15, 2024, subject to the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones, and satisfaction of certain capitalization requirements. The final tranche of $25 million is available to the Company through year-end 2024, subject to approval from the lenders.

""We’re very excited to expand our partnership with Geron to support the Company’s efforts in advancing imetelstat as a potential transformative treatment for hematologic malignancies. The increased commitment is aimed to support Geron’s clinical, regulatory and commercialization efforts in this pivotal time in the Company’s development, and is yet another example of Hercules’ capabilities to support innovative life science companies through development and commercialization,"" said Himani Bhalla, Managing Director at Hercules Capital.

""We are delighted to work with Hercules and support Geron’s continued development and potential commercialization of imetelstat,"" said Peter Sletteland, Director at Silicon Valley Bank.

About Geron

Geron is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and potential commercialization of a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic malignancies. The Company currently is conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials: IMerge in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes and IMpactMF in refractory myelofibrosis.

Use of Forward-Looking Statements

Except for the historical information contained herein, this press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such statements, include, without limitation, those regarding: (i) that top-line results from the IMerge Phase 3 trial in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are expected in early January 2023; (ii) that if the data from IMerge Phase 3 are supportive, there will be U.S. and EU regulatory filings thereafter; (iii) that the potential additional debt proceeds when added to Geron’s current financial resources and the projected proceeds from exercises of currently outstanding warrants in 2023 will be sufficient to fund the Company’s projected level of operations until the middle of 2024; (iv) that there will be a potential commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the U.S. in 2024; (v) that the $20 million first tranche is available subject to the achievement of certain clinical and financial milestones; (vi) that the $10 million second tranche is available subject to the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and satisfaction of certain capitalization requirements; (vii) that the $20 million third tranche is available subject to the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and satisfaction of certain capitalization requirements; (viii) that the $25 million final tranche will be available to Geron following approval from the lenders; (ix) that imetelstat is a potentially transformative treatment for hematologic malignancies; and (x) other statements that are not historical facts, constitute forward looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, include, without limitation, those related to: (a) the timeline in (i) above may not be met due to the Company’s inability to manage the procedures necessary for obtaining the top-line results in IMerge Phase 3 or by the continuing COVID pandemic; (b) whether the top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are positive and result in regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU; (c) whether the financial, clinical and regulatory milestones required for access to the various tranches are achieved; (d) whether U.S. and EU regulatory authorities approve imetelstat for commercialization; (e) whether the FDA or another regulatory authority imposes a clinical hold on IMerge Phase 3 that causes a delay in reporting top-line results or a cessation of the clinical trial; and (f) that imetelstat actually demonstrates in Phase 3 clinical trials that it is a transformative treatment for hematologic malignancies. Detailed information on the above risks and uncertainties and additional risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in Geron’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading ""Risk Factors,"" included in Geron’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, and the facts and assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements may change.

The reverse stock split was previously approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 24, 2022.

WMC’s common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the New York Stock Exchange at the market open on July 11, 2022. Once effective, the reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding from approximately 60.6 million to approximately 6.06 million. In addition, the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock will be reduced by a corresponding ratio.

No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. In lieu thereof, the Company’s transfer agent will aggregate all fractional shares and sell them as soon as practicable after the effective time at the then-prevailing prices on the open market. After the transfer agent’s completion of such sale, stockholders who would have been entitled to a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will instead receive a cash payment from the transfer agent in an amount equal to their respective pro rata share of the total proceeds of that sale.

The primary objective of the reverse stock split is to increase the market price of the Company’s common stock and improve the marketability and liquidity of the Company’s common stock, as further described in the Company’s last proxy statement.

The trading symbol for the Company’s common stock will remain ""WMC."" The new CUSIP number for the Company’s common stock following the reverse stock split is 95790D204.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:14:27+00:00,Former top Apple lawyer pleads guilty to insider trading,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - The former top corporate lawyer at Apple Inc pleaded guilty on Thursday to insider trading charges, for what prosecutors called a five-year scheme to trade ahead of the iPhone maker's quarterly earnings announcements.

Gene Levoff, 48, of San Carlos, California, pleaded guilty to six securities fraud charges at a hearing before U.S. District Judge William Martini in Newark, New Jersey.

Levoff allegedly exploited his roles as corporate secretary, head of corporate law and co-chair of a committee that reviewed drafts of Apple's results to generate $604,000 of illegal gains on more than $14 million of trades from 2011 to 2016.

Prosecutors said Levoff ignored the quarterly ""blackout periods"" that barred trading before Apple's results were released, as well as the company's broader insider trading policy -- which he was responsible for enforcing.

""Gene Levoff betrayed the trust of one of the world's largest tech companies for his own financial gain,"" First Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna in New Jersey said in a statement.

A lawyer for Levoff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison term and $5 million fine, though Levoff's punishment would likely be much less. Levoff's sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 10.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fired Levoff in September 2018, five months before he was criminally charged. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.

Authorities have said servers were located in New Jersey for firms that handled Levoff's trades, explaining why the criminal case was filed in that state.

The case is U.S. v. Levoff, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 19-cr-00780.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:13:00+00:00,Borr Drilling Limited - Update on Refinance,"HAMILTON, Bermuda, June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Borr Drilling Limited (the ""Company"") (NYSE: BORR) (OSE: BORR) refers to its previous communication regarding its ongoing negotiations with creditors to reach mutual agreements to refinance and extend its 2023 maturities and complete such refinancing by 30 June 2022.

Significant progress has been made in the negotiations with the target to put in place the right capital structure for the company going forward. A complete solution will require a further equity injection combined with debt repayments, extensions and concessions by the creditors resulting in a robust capital structure that supports a low cash break even and thereby a higher free cash generation.

In order to have the required time to conclude full lock-up and commitments from all creditors, the necessary covenant waivers have been extended until 15 July 2022 by the lenders in the bank syndicate. Thus far specific proposals have been received from all creditor groups, some of which have already resulted in agreements in principle. In particular, we have agreed terms in principle for the refinancing of the senior secured bank facility in July 2022 to be funded with a mix of a new credit facility and equity/an asset sale.

We will continue to work with all remaining creditors to arrive at an optimized overall financing solution, targeted to be in place by 15 July 2022.

This press release does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:12:08+00:00,"ITT's Abundant Prospects a Boon, Persistent Risks a Bane","ITT Inc. ITT stands to gain from its presence in diverse end markets, which allows it to neutralize risks associated with a single market. In the quarters ahead, strength in industrial, aerospace & defense and chemical end markets coupled with auto market recovery and solid demand for connectors is likely to benefit ITT. For 2022, organic sales are predicted to grow 9-11% on a year-over-year basis.

ITT believes in strengthening its competency with innovation and growth investments. It has been investing in product innovation across its connectors, friction technologies and pump businesses. ITT unveiled the third generation of its i-ALERT Condition Monitoring Solution in May 2022. Also, its connector business launched its ruggedized, modular circular series Veam MOVE-MOD in November 2021. The buyout of Habonim in April 2022 will help ITT boost its offerings in cryogenic and hydrogen ball valve space apart from expanding into new end markets.

ITT focuses on rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the first three months of 2022, ITT used $22.4 million for paying out dividends and buying back shares worth $186 million. Also, in February 2022, the quarterly dividend rate was hiked 20%.

However, ITT has been witnessing the negative impacts of escalating costs and expenses for a while. ITT’s cost of sales increased 8.2% on a year-over-year basis in first-quarter 2022. Also, its general and administrative expenses rose 4%, while sales and marketing expenses jumped 4.6%. Supply-chain constraints and higher raw material costs are likely to affect its margins and profitability over time.

Given its widespread presence, ITT’s performance is exposed to risks arising from geopolitical tensions, trade relations and adverse movements in foreign currencies. Forex woes hampered ITT’s sales 2.8% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. The performance of its overseas business might be depressed by a stronger U.S. dollar in the quarters ahead.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:10:59+00:00,Micron's weak outlook sparks concerns of chip down cycle,"By Chavi Mehta and Jane Lanhee Lee

(Reuters) -Micron Technology Inc projected fourth-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates on Thursday, a sign that geopolitical turmoil and weakness in consumer spending would weigh on demand for its memory chips.

Shares of the Boise, Idaho-based company initially fell 6.3% in extended trading but later pared losses to trade flat. The weak outlook could raise broader concern the chip market is heading into a down cycle after a recent shortage.

Micron forecast adjusted revenue for the current quarter at $7.2 billion, plus or minus $400 million. Analysts on average expected a figure of $9.05 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

“We believe that demand has weakened considerably and we've seen that even in the areas that have been significantly constrained,"" Nikolay Todorov, analyst at Longbow Research, said. “Micron will essentially start or signal that the semiconductor cycle is turning.”

The outlook for memory chip makers has worsened in recent months as surging inflation, China's cooling economy and the Russia-Ukraine war hit consumer spending on smartphones and personal computers, a crucial market for the industry.

That has driven down chip prices and led to a buildup of inventories, with research firm TrendForce estimating a 3% to 8% drop in prices of DRAM chips during the third quarter of 2022.

“Recently, the industry demand environment has weakened, and we are taking action to moderate our supply growth in fiscal 2023,"" said Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra in the earnings release. ""We are confident about the long-term secular demand for memory and storage and are well positioned to deliver strong cross-cycle financial performance.”

DRAM chips - widely used in data centers, personal computers and other devices - account for two-thirds of Micron's revenue, and the company also makes NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market.

The company expects adjusted profit for the quarter of $1.63 per share, plus or minus 20 cents, compared with estimates of $2.57 per share.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:10:00+00:00,"OSCR SHAREHOLDER ALERT: ROSEN, A HIGHLY RECOGNIZED LAW FIRM, Encourages Oscar Health, Inc. Investors with Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important July 11 Deadline in Securities Class Action – OSCR","NEW YORK, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE: OSCR) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with the Company’s March 2021 initial public offering (“IPO” or the “Offering”), of the important July 11, 2022 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Oscar securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statement you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Oscar class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6200 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 11, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, the Registration Statement was materially false and misleading and omitted to state that: (1) Oscar was experiencing growing COVID-19 testing and treatment costs; (2) Oscar was experiencing growing net COVID-19 costs; (3) Oscar would be negatively impacted by an unfavorable prior year Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) result relating to 2019 and 2020; (4) Oscar was on track to be negatively impacted by significant Special Enrollment Period (SEP) membership growth; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Oscar’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

To join the Oscar class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6200 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The Fund has declared a distribution payable on June 30, 2022, to shareholders of record as of June 23, 2022, with an ex-dividend date of June 22, 2022. This Notice is meant to provide you information about the sources of your Fund’s distributions. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan.

The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date for the Fund from the following sources: net investment income (""NII""); net realized short-term capital gains (""STCG""); net realized long-term capital gains (""LTCG""); and return of capital (""ROC""). These estimates are based upon information projected through June 30, 2022, are calculated based on a generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") basis and include the prior fiscal year-end undistributed net investment income. The amounts and sources of distributions are expressed per common share.

(1) Includes the most recent quarterly distribution paid on June 30, 2022.
(2) The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income.""
(3) Based on Net Asset Value (""NAV"") as of May 31, 2022.
(4) Total Returns are through May 31, 2022.

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. You should not use this Notice as a substitute for your Form 1099-DIV.

First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services.

Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the fund are identified below. The principal risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the fund's shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.

Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

Securities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine which has caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities could have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. While the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of ""reasonably"" normal business activity in the United States, many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread. Additionally, there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease.

Shares of closed-end investment companies such as the Fund frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund cannot predict whether its common shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

The Fund may write (sell) covered call options on all or a portion of the equity securities held in the Fund's portfolio. The use of options may require the Fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold an equity security that it might otherwise sell.

Premiums from writing (selling) call options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in the Fund's portfolio can vary widely over time.

An adverse event affecting an issuer of equity securities, such as an unfavorable earnings report, may depress the value of a particular equity security held by the Fund. Also, the prices of equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the prices of equity securities to which the Fund has exposure. There is no guarantee that the issuers of the equity securities in which the Fund invests will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will remain at current levels. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income.

Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries.

The Fund may not invest 25% or more of its total assets in securities of issuers in any single industry. If the Fund is focused in an industry, it may present more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries of the economy.

The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework. Financial professionals are responsible for evaluating investment risks independently and for exercising independent judgment in determining whether investments are appropriate for their clients.

The recently completed Lottery sale and the pending sale of OpenBet will cumulatively generate approximately $5.6 billion of estimated net after-tax proceeds.

""Endeavor is the right partner for OpenBet and the amended agreement increases speed and certainty by creating a simplified path to closing the transaction, while unlocking substantial benefits for OpenBet and Light & Wonder,"" said Barry Cottle, President and Chief Executive Officer of Light & Wonder. ""OpenBet demonstrates continued momentum across their key markets and the amended terms of the transaction provide strong value for the business.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Targeted Net Debt Leverage Ratio

Net debt is defined as total principal face value of debt outstanding, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, less cash and cash equivalents. Principal face value of debt outstanding includes the face value of debt issued under Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes, which are all described in Note 15 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and in Note 11 of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, but it does not include other long term obligations of $3 million primarily comprised of certain revenue transactions presented as debt in accordance with ASC 470. Net debt leverage ratio, represents Net debt divided by Combined AEBITDA (as defined below) (or Consolidated AEBITDA for future periods after the disposition of discontinued operations). The forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure targeted net debt leverage ratio is presented on a supplemental basis and does not reflect Company guidance. We are not providing a forward-looking quantitative reconciliation of targeted net debt leverage ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the relevant period.

Targeted Consolidated AEBITDA

Consolidated AEBITDA, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is presented as a supplemental disclosure of the Company’s continuing operations. Consolidated AEBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements filed with the SEC. Consolidated AEBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Consolidated AEBITDA is reconciled to Net income (loss) attributable to the Company and includes the following adjustments: (1) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest; (2) Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax; (3) Restructuring and other, which includes charges or expenses attributable to: (i) employee severance; (ii) management restructuring and related costs; (iii) restructuring and integration; (iv) cost savings initiatives; (v) major litigation; and (vi) acquisition costs and other unusual items; (4) Depreciation amortization and impairment charges and Goodwill impairments; (5) change in fair value of investments and Gain on remeasurement of debt; (6) Interest expense; (7) Income tax expense (benefit); (8) Stock-based compensation; and (9) Other income, net including foreign currency (gains) and losses, and earnings from equity investments. The forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure Targeted Consolidated AEBITDA represents a goal for the Company and does not reflect Company guidance. We are not providing a forward-looking quantitative reconciliation of Targeted Consolidated AEBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to do so without unreasonable efforts or to reasonably estimate the projected outcome of certain significant items. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors out of our control and could have a material impact on the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:09:37+00:00,UPDATE 1-Micron forecasts fourth-quarter profit below estimates,"(shares, profit forecast, background)

June 30 (Reuters) - Micron Technology projected fourth-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates on Thursday, a sign that geopolitical turmoil and weakness in consumer spending would weigh on demand for its memory chips.

Shares of the Boise, Idaho-based company fell 6.3% in extended trading.

The outlook for memory chipmakers has worsened in recent months as surging inflation, China's cooling economy and the Russia-Ukraine war hit consumer spending on smartphones and personal computers, a crucial market for the industry.

That has driven down chip prices and led to a build-up of inventories, with research firm TrendForce estimating a 3% to 8% drop in prices of DRAM chips during the third quarter of 2022.

DRAM chips - widely used in data centers, personal computers, and other devices - account for two-thirds of Micron's revenue, and the company also makes NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market.

Micron forecast adjusted revenue for the current quarter to be $7.2 billion, plus or minus $400 million. Analysts on average expected a figure of $9.05 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The company expects adjusted profit for the quarter to be $1.63 per share, plus or minus 20 cents, compared with estimates of $2.57 per share.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:08:32+00:00,General Mills Has Pricing Power,"General Mills Inc. (NYSE:GIS) has stealthily been one of the best performers in the S&P 500 Index as the stock has climbed more than 24% over the last year. The index has fallen 11% over that same time frame.

The company reported earnings results on Wednesday that topped analysts estimates. Inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints remain an issue, but General Mills appears to have pricing power that can largely offset these headwinds. Shareholders received a dividend increase as well.

GIS 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of GIS Peter Lynch Chart of GIS

Lets look closer at the companys most recent quarter to see why investors looking for a safe, defensive stock should consider owning General Mills.

Quarterly highlights

General Mills reported fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2022 results on June 29. For the quarter, revenue grew 8.1% to $4.89 billion, which was $83 million above analysts estimates. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 compared favorably to 91 cents in the prior year and was 11 cents better than expected.

For the year, revenue grew 5% to $19 billion, while adjusted earnings per share of $3.94 compared to $3.79 in the prior year.

Organic growth for the fiscal year was 6%, but the fourth-quarter total was 13%. Included in the quarterly revenue total was a 400-basis point headwind from divestures and acquisition activity. Driving much of the organic growth was a 14% contribution from higher prices and mix. Organic volumes did fall 2%, however.

The three largest segments within the company saw at least a mid-double-digit improvement in price and mix during the quarter.

Organic sales grew 11% for the North America Retail segment, driven by a 15% combination from price and mix. Gains were seen in U.S. snacks and breakfast foods. Almost two-thirds of products grew or maintained their market share.

The Pet division had organic growth of 22%. Despite higher prices, volume climbed 8%. The Blue Buffalo brand continues to acquire market share and the acquisitions of Nudges and True Chews pet treats were a positive factor in the quarter.

Story continues

The North American Foodservice business continues to rebound from the worst of the pandemic as organic sales were higher by 25%. Higher demand in key categories led to higher prices, which aided results by 27%. Volume declined just 2%.

International organic growth was 6%, which was composed entirely of price increases and product mix. Volume was flat for the quarter. Market share grew or held by 69% of retail sales.

Looking ahead, General Mills also provided guidance for fiscal year 2023. The company expects organic growth in the range of 4% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be flat to up 3% in constant currency.

The market responded favorably to the companys earnings report as shares ended the day 6.4% higher.

Takeaways

General Mills did benefit from lapping the weakest quarter in the prior fiscal year, making for a somewhat easy comparable period. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 saw revenue down almost 10% from the pandemic-aided prior year. That said, sales were up more than 22% from the pre-pandemic period, which should be a sign the company is not just relying on Covid-19-related demand to grow. Adjusted earnings per share are also ahead of pre-pandemic totals.

The fourth quarter finished off a strong fiscal year. Each quarter saw a sequential improvement in organic price and mix, another piece of evidence that shows raising prices has not driven customers away. The ability to have pricing power when inflation is running at levels not seen in decades is a significant competitive advantage for General Mills and is not something many peers are experiencing.

Organic growth for the year turned out to be much better than the company had initially expected. At the start of the fiscal year, General Mills had forecasted organic growth in a range of down 1% to down 3%. Producing 6% growth for the year speaks to the strength of the companys brands.

General Mills appears to be handling inflationary pressures as well as can be expected under the circumstances. The company recorded a double-digit gain from higher prices, with demand falling just slightly. Even in an inflationary environment, it took market share in most areas. This shows its brands resonate with consumers and they are willing to pay more for the companys products. These are invaluable assets to have given the inflationary backdrop.

It should be noted the company is not completely immune to higher input costs and supply chain constraints. The adjusted gross margin fell 70 basis points to 33.8% as inflation was a double-digit headwind to results. Higher costs of goods sold also impacted the gross margin.

On the other hand, the adjusted operating margin climbed 200 basis points to 18.3% due to lower selling, general and adminstrative expenses as a result of the companys cost savings program.

Most product categories are seeing a high rate of on-shelf availability, except for refrigerated dough, pizza and hot snacks. These categories are running below the overall portfolio, though on-shelf availability has gotten much better since the middle of the third quarter.

Finally, company guidance for fiscal 2023 is solid, though leadership does expect inflationary costs to be close to 14% of cost of goods sold. This pressure will be partially offset by cost increases and the cost savings program. Volume could see a small decline again, but consumers have shown over the past few quarters that high prices for General Mills products are not much of a deal breaker.

Leaderships expectation for 4% to 5% organic growth is in line with the company's performance over the past several years, showing how consistent its business has been in the medium term.

Final thoughts

General Mills most recent quarter showed the power of being able to raise prices without facing a substantial impairment to volume. The companys products remain in high demand even after a small reset following elevated buying related to Covid-19.

In addition, General Mills raised its dividend nearly 6%. The company has now paid continuous dividends since 1898, a lengthy streak that not many others can match. Shares yield 2.9%, nearly twice the average yield for the S&P 500 Index.

General Mills stock is trading at nearly 19 times the midpoint of forward earnings, which is slightly ahead of the 10-year average price-earnings ratio of 17, according to Value Line.

That said, investors looking for a company with proven pricing power and the ability to withstand the worst of inflation could find General Mills an attractive investment option based on its market outperformance and solid yield.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:06:08+00:00,Rising Airfreight Revenues Aid Expeditors (EXPD) Despite High Debt,"Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD currently benefits from an uptick in airfreight revenues. However, a decline in its current ratio is concerning.

Expeditors’ first-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.05 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77. The bottom line rose 22.75% year over year. Total revenues of $4,664.3 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,175.6 million and also increased 38.9% year over year.

How is Expeditors Faring?

Expeditors is being aided by the uptick in airfreight revenues. Revenues from its airfreight services segment soared 63.3% year over year in 2020. The coronavirus-induced cancellation of multiple passenger flights (that usually carry freight as well as passenger luggage) increased the usage of charters. Due to the pandemic-led imbalance between scheduled capacity and demand, EXPD is using charters to meet customer needs. Revenues from the airfreight services unit increased 58.4% year over year in 2021. Despite the cyberattack-related woes, segmental revenues climbed 20.6% in first-quarter 2022. Revenues from the segment are expected to be strong in the second quarter of 2022 as well. Results will be available on Aug 2.

We are impressed by Expeditors' efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. In the coronavirus-ravaged 2020, EXPD repurchased 4.6 million shares at an average price of $72.26 per share. During 2021, EXPD bought back 4.4 million shares at an average price of $117.54 per share. In May 2022, management had announced a 15.5% hike in semi-annual cash dividend to 67 cents per share (annualized $1.34 per share).

The year-over-year decline in Expeditors' current ratio in first-quarter 2022 is concerning. EXPD's current ratio in first-quarter 2022 was 1.87 compared with 2.05 at the end of the first quarter of 2021.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:05:00+00:00,REDUCE-IT Exploratory Post Hoc Biomarker Sub-Analysis Shows Relatively Small Changes in Inflammatory Markers Between Icosapent Ethyl and Placebo,"Amarin Corporation plc

-- Sub-Analysis Findings Support Prior Analyses that Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) Level is The Major Determinant of Benefit in REDUCE-IT --

DUBLIN, Ireland and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) today announced an exploratory post hoc sub-analysis of REDUCE-IT serum samples that found statin-treated patients allocated to icosapent ethyl (IPE) had limited differences in certain lipid and inflammatory biomarkers compared with statin-treated patients allocated to mineral oil placebo. These findings are consistent with prior reported data and support previous analyses that demonstrated the majority of benefit from IPE was from achieved eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels in REDUCE-IT. This sub-analysis was published online today in the journal Circulation.

In the landmark REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes study, IPE achieved 25 percent relative risk reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, 5-point composite endpoint: cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina). This also included relative risk reductions of 31 percent, 28 percent and 20 percent in heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths, respectively. As previously presented, the only marker that seems to have strong association with reductions in MACE from the REDUCE-IT study is serum EPA levels; these data were previously presented at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in 2020.i

“Regardless of biomarker pathway, effects were small on an absolute scale for both icosapent ethyl and for placebo, and changes in values were mostly below the limits of quantification in this exploratory sub-analysis,” said Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., Executive Director of Interventional Cardiovascular Programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, principal investigator of REDUCE-IT and co-author of the biomarker sub-analysis. “While the mechanisms of action contributing to the reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl are not completely understood and are likely multi-factorial, previous studies have clearly demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA. The current analysis of REDUCE-IT finds a difference in inflammatory markers between icosapent ethyl and placebo, however, the absolute magnitude of these differences is too small to explain the substantial reduction in clinical events seen in the REDUCE-IT trial, which is most likely due to the approximate 400% increase in EPA levels.”

Story continues

Additionally, clinical studies suggest that IPE may be contributing to plaque reduction, regression and stabilization in patients with coronary artery disease.ii,iii,iv Additional studies are needed to further elucidate any effects on plaque characteristics. A prior randomized, cardiovascular outcomes trial of EPA versus standard of care demonstrated that EPA provided a 19% cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with normal triglyceride levels and only lowered triglyceride levels by 5%, suggesting that the effects of EPA go beyond triglyceride lowering.v

“While exploratory biomarker sub-analyses are interesting scientifically, what is most clear and important clinically are the cardiovascular outcomes results seen in the REDUCE-IT trial overall,” said Nabil Abadir, MB. CH.B., Chief Medical Officer, Amarin. “As we know, the REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated the clear risk reduction benefits of icosapent ethyl in reducing cardiovascular events among patients most at risk for cardiovascular disease, especially those with prior cardiovascular events such as heart attack or coronary revascularization procedures.”

Added Dr. Abadir, “The landmark REDUCE-IT trial and its clinical outcomes underpin the international regulatory approvals of VASCEPA®/VAZKEPA® as well as the more than 25 clinical treatment guidelines, consensus statements and scientific statements from medical societies or journals around the globe that have been updated recommending the use of icosapent ethyl in appropriate at-risk patients. Based on the results of REDUCE-IT, regulatory agencies granted approval of IPE for ASCVD risk reduction for millions of high-risk patients with characteristics like those enrolled and followed in the study.”

This REDUCE-IT post hoc biomarker sub-analysis was funded by Amarin under a research grant.

About Amarin 
Amarin is an innovative pharmaceutical company leading a new paradigm in cardiovascular disease management. From our foundation in scientific research to our focus on clinical trials, and now our commercial expansion, we are evolving and growing rapidly. Amarin has offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey in the United States, Dublin in Ireland, Zug in Switzerland, and other countries in Europe as well as commercial partners and suppliers around the world.

About REDUCE-IT® 
REDUCE-IT was a global cardiovascular outcomes study designed to evaluate the effect of VASCEPA in adult patients with LDL-C controlled to between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline 75 mg/dL) by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or diabetes mellitus and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (primary prevention cohort). REDUCE-IT, conducted over seven years and completed in 2018, followed 8,179 patients at over 400 clinical sites in 11 countries with the largest number of sites located within the United States. REDUCE-IT was conducted based on a special protocol assessment agreement with FDA. The design of the REDUCE-IT study was published in March 2017 in Clinical Cardiology.vi The primary results of REDUCE-IT were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2018.vii The total events results of REDUCE-IT were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in March 2019.viii These and other publications can be found in the Science section on the company’s website at www.amarincorp.com.

About VASCEPA® (icosapent ethyl) Capsules
VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl) capsules are the first prescription treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comprised solely of the active ingredient, icosapent ethyl (IPE), a unique form of eicosapentaenoic acid. VASCEPA was launched in the United States in January 2020 as the first and only drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of the studied high-risk patients with persistent cardiovascular risk after statin therapy. VASCEPA was initially launched in the United States in 2013 based on the drug’s initial FDA approved indication for use as an adjunct therapy to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Since launch, VASCEPA has been prescribed more than 18 million times. VASCEPA is covered by most major medical insurance plans. In addition to the United States, icosapent ethyl is approved and sold in Canada, Germany, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. In Europe, in March 2021 marketing authorization was granted to icosapent ethyl in the European Union for the reduction of risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk, under the brand name VAZKEPA.

Indications and Limitation of Use (in the United States) VASCEPA is indicated:

As an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adult patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels (≥ 150 mg/dL) and

established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. As an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.

The effect of VASCEPA on the risk for pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined.

Important Safety Information

VASCEPA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to VASCEPA or any of its components. VASCEPA was associated with an increased risk (3% vs 2%) of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at an increased risk of an allergic reaction to VASCEPA. Patients with such allergies should discontinue VASCEPA if any reactions occur. VASCEPA was associated with an increased risk (12% vs 10%) of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin. Common adverse reactions in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (incidence ≥3% and ≥1% more frequent than placebo): musculoskeletal pain (4% vs 3%), peripheral edema (7% vs 5%), constipation (5% vs 4%), gout (4% vs 3%), and atrial fibrillation (5% vs 4%). Common adverse reactions in the hypertriglyceridemia trials (incidence >1% more frequent than placebo): arthralgia (2% vs 1%) and oropharyngeal pain (1% vs 0.3%). Adverse events may be reported by calling 1-855-VASCEPA or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Patients receiving VASCEPA and concomitant anticoagulants and/or anti-platelet agents should be monitored for bleeding.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:05:00+00:00,REDUCE-IT Exploratory Post Hoc Biomarker Sub-Analysis Shows Relatively Small Changes in Inflammatory Markers Between Icosapent Ethyl and Placebo,"-- Sub-Analysis Findings Support Prior Analyses that Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) Level is The Major Determinant of Benefit in REDUCE-IT --

DUBLIN, Ireland and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN) today announced an exploratory post hoc sub-analysis of REDUCE-IT serum samples that found statin-treated patients allocated to icosapent ethyl (IPE) had limited differences in certain lipid and inflammatory biomarkers compared with statin-treated patients allocated to mineral oil placebo. These findings are consistent with prior reported data and support previous analyses that demonstrated the majority of benefit from IPE was from achieved eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels in REDUCE-IT. This sub-analysis was published online today in the journal Circulation.

In the landmark REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes study, IPE achieved 25 percent relative risk reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, 5-point composite endpoint: cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina). This also included relative risk reductions of 31 percent, 28 percent and 20 percent in heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths, respectively. As previously presented, the only marker that seems to have strong association with reductions in MACE from the REDUCE-IT study is serum EPA levels; these data were previously presented at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in 2020.i

“Regardless of biomarker pathway, effects were small on an absolute scale for both icosapent ethyl and for placebo, and changes in values were mostly below the limits of quantification in this exploratory sub-analysis,” said Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., Executive Director of Interventional Cardiovascular Programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, principal investigator of REDUCE-IT and co-author of the biomarker sub-analysis. “While the mechanisms of action contributing to the reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl are not completely understood and are likely multi-factorial, previous studies have clearly demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of EPA. The current analysis of REDUCE-IT finds a difference in inflammatory markers between icosapent ethyl and placebo, however, the absolute magnitude of these differences is too small to explain the substantial reduction in clinical events seen in the REDUCE-IT trial, which is most likely due to the approximate 400% increase in EPA levels.”

Additionally, clinical studies suggest that IPE may be contributing to plaque reduction, regression and stabilization in patients with coronary artery disease.ii,iii,iv Additional studies are needed to further elucidate any effects on plaque characteristics. A prior randomized, cardiovascular outcomes trial of EPA versus standard of care demonstrated that EPA provided a 19% cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with normal triglyceride levels and only lowered triglyceride levels by 5%, suggesting that the effects of EPA go beyond triglyceride lowering.v

“While exploratory biomarker sub-analyses are interesting scientifically, what is most clear and important clinically are the cardiovascular outcomes results seen in the REDUCE-IT trial overall,” said Nabil Abadir, MB. CH.B., Chief Medical Officer, Amarin. “As we know, the REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated the clear risk reduction benefits of icosapent ethyl in reducing cardiovascular events among patients most at risk for cardiovascular disease, especially those with prior cardiovascular events such as heart attack or coronary revascularization procedures.”

Added Dr. Abadir, “The landmark REDUCE-IT trial and its clinical outcomes underpin the international regulatory approvals of VASCEPA®/VAZKEPA® as well as the more than 25 clinical treatment guidelines, consensus statements and scientific statements from medical societies or journals around the globe that have been updated recommending the use of icosapent ethyl in appropriate at-risk patients. Based on the results of REDUCE-IT, regulatory agencies granted approval of IPE for ASCVD risk reduction for millions of high-risk patients with characteristics like those enrolled and followed in the study.”

This REDUCE-IT post hoc biomarker sub-analysis was funded by Amarin under a research grant.

About Amarin 
Amarin is an innovative pharmaceutical company leading a new paradigm in cardiovascular disease management. From our foundation in scientific research to our focus on clinical trials, and now our commercial expansion, we are evolving and growing rapidly. Amarin has offices in Bridgewater, New Jersey in the United States, Dublin in Ireland, Zug in Switzerland, and other countries in Europe as well as commercial partners and suppliers around the world. We are committed to increasing the scientific understanding of the cardiovascular risk that persists beyond traditional therapies and advancing the treatment of that risk.

About REDUCE-IT® 
REDUCE-IT was a global cardiovascular outcomes study designed to evaluate the effect of VASCEPA in adult patients with LDL-C controlled to between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline 75 mg/dL) by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or diabetes mellitus and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (primary prevention cohort). REDUCE-IT, conducted over seven years and completed in 2018, followed 8,179 patients at over 400 clinical sites in 11 countries with the largest number of sites located within the United States. REDUCE-IT was conducted based on a special protocol assessment agreement with FDA. The design of the REDUCE-IT study was published in March 2017 in Clinical Cardiology.vi The primary results of REDUCE-IT were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November 2018.vii The total events results of REDUCE-IT were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in March 2019.viii These and other publications can be found in the Science section on the company’s website at www.amarincorp.com.

About VASCEPA® (icosapent ethyl) Capsules
VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl) capsules are the first prescription treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comprised solely of the active ingredient, icosapent ethyl (IPE), a unique form of eicosapentaenoic acid. VASCEPA was launched in the United States in January 2020 as the first and only drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of the studied high-risk patients with persistent cardiovascular risk after statin therapy. VASCEPA was initially launched in the United States in 2013 based on the drug’s initial FDA approved indication for use as an adjunct therapy to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Since launch, VASCEPA has been prescribed more than 18 million times. VASCEPA is covered by most major medical insurance plans. In addition to the United States, icosapent ethyl is approved and sold in Canada, Germany, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. In Europe, in March 2021 marketing authorization was granted to icosapent ethyl in the European Union for the reduction of risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk, under the brand name VAZKEPA.

Indications and Limitation of Use (in the United States) VASCEPA is indicated:

As an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adult patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels (≥ 150 mg/dL) and

established cardiovascular disease ordiabetes mellitus and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.As an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.

The effect of VASCEPA on the risk for pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined.

Important Safety Information

VASCEPA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to VASCEPA or any of its components.VASCEPA was associated with an increased risk (3% vs 2%) of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at an increased risk of an allergic reaction to VASCEPA. Patients with such allergies should discontinue VASCEPA if any reactions occur.VASCEPA was associated with an increased risk (12% vs 10%) of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin.Common adverse reactions in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (incidence ≥3% and ≥1% more frequent than placebo): musculoskeletal pain (4% vs 3%), peripheral edema (7% vs 5%), constipation (5% vs 4%), gout (4% vs 3%), and atrial fibrillation (5% vs 4%).Common adverse reactions in the hypertriglyceridemia trials (incidence >1% more frequent than placebo): arthralgia (2% vs 1%) and oropharyngeal pain (1% vs 0.3%).Adverse events may be reported by calling 1-855-VASCEPA or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.Patients receiving VASCEPA and concomitant anticoagulants and/or anti-platelet agents should be monitored for bleeding.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Materials, Inc. has published its latest Sustainability Report, detailing its environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs and results from the past year. The report charts the company’s progress toward a series of 10-year initiatives, introduced in 2020, that encompass its own operations, how Applied works with customers and suppliers, and how its technology can be used to advance sustainability on a global scale.

“At Applied Materials, we recognize that our position as a global technology leader comes with tremendous responsibility to our employees, to our customers and to society,” said Gary Dickerson, President and CEO. “The opportunity for technology to shape a more equitable and sustainable world has never been more promising, and Applied is committed to working across the ecosystem to drive critical advances that can enable a better future for generations to come.”

Semiconductors have become essential to the world as technology plays an ever increasing role in peoples’ lives and in enabling discoveries that can help solve global challenges. As the world uses more semiconductors, it is crucial for the industry to continue developing cleaner and more efficient processes for manufacturing chips.

As part of its contribution to a more sustainable industry, Applied is making progress on reducing its carbon footprint and is taking steps to increase transparency in its environmental reporting. From 2019 to 2021, Applied’s use of renewable electricity increased from 37 percent to 57 percent globally. In the U.S., Applied has reached 80-percent renewable electricity and is on track to achieve its goal of 100 percent by the end of this year. Through these efforts, Applied’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions – those produced directly by the company and by the energy it purchases – were reduced by 28 percent, even as its overall energy consumption rose by approximately 7 percent to support new facilities and expanded production.

In addition, using 2019 as the base year, Applied quantified and disclosed all relevant categories of its Scope 3 emissions – those generated across the entire value chain – for its semiconductor products and achieved third-party assurance of the data. For the first time, the company reported its carbon impact and risks in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Having a more complete picture of its carbon footprint will help Applied deliver on its commitment to set science-based targets for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by the end of this year.

Applied Materials has been reporting on social responsibility and environmental matters since 2005. The company’s latest Sustainability Report and Annex reflect activities and results through the end of fiscal year 2021.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Akebia Therapeutics®, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease, today announced that it has executed an agreement to terminate the U.S. and ex-U.S. vadadustat Collaboration and License Agreements with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka). As part of the termination, Otsuka has agreed to pay Akebia a settlement fee of $55 million. Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for people living with kidney disease (PRNewsfoto/Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.)

As a result of the termination of the agreements, Akebia is regaining the rights from Otsuka for vadadustat, an investigational oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, in the United States, Europe, China, Russia, Canada, Australia, the Middle East, and certain other territories.

""We continue to believe in the potential of vadadustat as an oral treatment for patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease, and we are pleased to be regaining the full rights to the product in these important markets,"" said John Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. ""Otsuka has been a strong partner for many years, and we appreciate their desire to have an efficient transfer of the responsibilities back to Akebia. We plan to continue to pursue approval for vadadustat to make it available to patients in these territories, and we are excited about the potential additional value this brings to Akebia, as we continue to work to build the company into the future.""

In October 2021, Otsuka submitted an initial marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults. The review is in progress. Otsuka and Akebia will coordinate to transfer the MAA to Akebia through processes outlined by the EMA. Vadadustat is also under review in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Australia through the Access Consortium. Responsibilities for that review will transfer to Akebia as well at a date to be agreed upon.

Story continues

In the U.S., Akebia received a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for vadadustat. Akebia plans to evaluate and determine potential next steps for vadadustat in the U.S. following the end of review conference with the FDA.

In the U.S., Akebia separately has a distribution agreement in place with Vifor Pharma, providing potential access to up to 60% of U.S. dialysis patients through existing Vifor Pharma relationships. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation owns development and commercialization rights to vadadustat in Japan and certain other Asian counties.

About Akebia Therapeutics

Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease. The Company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, please visit our website at www.akebia.com, which does not form a part of this release.

About Vadadustat

Vadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. Vadadustat is an investigational new drug and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On March 29, 2022, the FDA issued a complete response letter to Akebia's New Drug Application for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vadadustat is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adults. In Japan, vadadustat is approved as a treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients.

About Anemia due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Anemia is a condition in which a person lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. It commonly occurs in people with CKD because their kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that helps regulate production of red blood cells. Anemia due to CKD can have a profound impact on a person's quality of life as it can cause fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. Left untreated, anemia leads to deterioration in health and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people with CKD.

(NASDAQ: TRIN) (""Trinity"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of debt and equipment financing to venture capital backed growth stage companies, today announced an adjustment to the conversion rate of its 6.00% Convertible Notes due 2025 (the ""Convertible Notes"") as a result of the Company's cash dividend of $0.57 per share consisting of a regular dividend of $0.42 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on July 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2022. The ex-dividend date for such dividends was June 29, 2022. (PRNewsfoto/Trinity Capital Inc.)

Effective immediately after the close of business on June 30, 2022, the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes will be adjusted to 68.7855 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes from the prior conversion rate of 67.5315 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which had been in effect since March 31, 2022.  As a result, effective as of such time, the conversion price applicable to the Convertible Notes will be adjusted to $14.54 per share of common stock from $14.81 per share of common stock.

The adjustment to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is being made pursuant to the second supplemental indenture, dated as of December 11, 2020, governing the Convertible Notes as a result of the Company's regular quarterly cash dividend discussed above exceeding the initial dividend threshold of $0.30 per share of common stock set forth in the second supplemental indenture and the Company paying a supplemental cash dividend.

Notice of the conversion rate adjustment will be delivered to the holders of the Convertible Notes and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, in accordance with the terms of the second supplemental indenture governing the Convertible Notes.

Certain Information Regarding Distributions

The Company's objective is to distribute four quarterly distributions in an amount that approximates 90% to 100% of its taxable quarterly income or potential annual income for a particular year in order to qualify for tax treatment as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In addition, during any particular year, the Company may pay additional supplemental distributions, so that the Company distributes approximately all its annual taxable income in the year it was earned, or it may spill over the excess taxable income into the coming year for future distribution payments.

Story continues

Distributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year and in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:05:00+00:00,Applied Materials Highlights Progress Toward its 10-Year Sustainability Roadmap,"Applied Materials, Inc.

Applied’s latest Sustainability Report outlines the company’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and increase transparency in environmental reporting

SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Materials, Inc. has published its latest Sustainability Report, detailing its environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs and results from the past year. The report charts the company’s progress toward a series of 10-year initiatives, introduced in 2020, that encompass its own operations, how Applied works with customers and suppliers, and how its technology can be used to advance sustainability on a global scale.

“At Applied Materials, we recognize that our position as a global technology leader comes with tremendous responsibility to our employees, to our customers and to society,” said Gary Dickerson, President and CEO. “The opportunity for technology to shape a more equitable and sustainable world has never been more promising, and Applied is committed to working across the ecosystem to drive critical advances that can enable a better future for generations to come.”

Semiconductors have become essential to the world as technology plays an ever increasing role in peoples’ lives and in enabling discoveries that can help solve global challenges. As the world uses more semiconductors, it is crucial for the industry to continue developing cleaner and more efficient processes for manufacturing chips.

As part of its contribution to a more sustainable industry, Applied is making progress on reducing its carbon footprint and is taking steps to increase transparency in its environmental reporting. From 2019 to 2021, Applied’s use of renewable electricity increased from 37 percent to 57 percent globally. In the U.S., Applied has reached 80-percent renewable electricity and is on track to achieve its goal of 100 percent by the end of this year. Through these efforts, Applied’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions – those produced directly by the company and by the energy it purchases – were reduced by 28 percent, even as its overall energy consumption rose by approximately 7 percent to support new facilities and expanded production.

Story continues

In addition, using 2019 as the base year, Applied quantified and disclosed all relevant categories of its Scope 3 emissions – those generated across the entire value chain – for its semiconductor products and achieved third-party assurance of the data. For the first time, the company reported its carbon impact and risks in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Having a more complete picture of its carbon footprint will help Applied deliver on its commitment to set science-based targets for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by the end of this year.

Applied Materials has been reporting on social responsibility and environmental matters since 2005. The company’s latest Sustainability Report and Annex reflect activities and results through the end of fiscal year 2021.

Viewers can email insidewish@wish.com with their questions, episode ideas, thought starters, or to give feedback on the series. Wish will use this feedback to inform future episodes.

Vijay continued, “When I first joined the company, I said ‘I firmly believe the best years for Wish are right ahead of us.’ I still believe this to be true. We have a long road ahead of us - and many episodes of ‘Inside Wish’ to share - before this vision is realized. It’s important to me that this series brings everyone into the fold during this pivotal time in Wish’s history.”

Wish first announced its turnaround plans last year. Key highlights of the company’s progress so far include:

New senior leadership team - in addition to Vijay, Wish has bolstered its leadership team with a new chief product officer, chief technology officer and chief financial officer.

""We look forward to providing this community with safe, reliable service by delivering on our infrastructure investment, technical expertise and decades of wastewater experience.""

Over the next five years, Pennsylvania American Water plans to invest more than $4 million in Upper Pottsgrove Township wastewater system improvements. These improvements include wastewater main and manhole replacements, technology and control system upgrades, lift station upgrades and meter replacements. The company has a long and successful track record of improving water and wastewater systems facing significant capital investment needs and making the necessary investments to meet current and future environmental regulations.

The $13.75 million purchase was approved on September 15, 2021, by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC). As part of the PUC’s approval, Pennsylvania American Water will adopt the existing Upper Pottsgrove Township wastewater rates and will transition customers to a monthly billing cycle. The PUC regulates the company’s rates, rules, and regulations of service; therefore, any future rate changes will require review and approval by the PUC.

The township agreed to sell its wastewater system to Pennsylvania American Water in May 2020, citing that the proposed sale was important to improve infrastructure, provide for resilient and responsive municipal services, and support the township’s future.

""The township approved the sale for several reasons. The greater financial resources and the professional expertise of Pennsylvania American Water far surpass the ability of the township to operate and provide the much-needed investment in the wastewater system, particularly as it relates to ever increasing environmental and regulatory compliance matters,"" said the commissioners of Upper Pottsgrove Township. ""Additionally, the associated risks of managing a wastewater system and their unforeseen costs were a major factor in transferring the system to Pennsylvania American Water. The proceeds of the sale will greatly enhance the long-term financial security of the township as well.""

Last month, Pennsylvania American Water also completed the acquisition of the City of York’s wastewater system in York County, which serves more than 45,000 customers, including 14,000 direct customer connections and bulk service to seven surrounding municipalities. It was the company’s largest wastewater system acquisition to date. With these two recent acquisitions, the company is now the wastewater provider for nearly 225,000 Pennsylvanians.

SEATTLE, June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Accolade, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACCD) today announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended May 31, 2022.

“The healthcare consumer has never been more in need of true Personalized Healthcare. Two years into the Covid-19 pandemic, the healthcare system remains as complex and difficult to navigate as ever. Our customers, their employees and direct consumers are increasingly turning to Accolade to solve a far more comprehensive set of healthcare challenges, while at the same time trying to manage the ever-rising cost of meeting those challenges. Our strong financial results in the first quarter demonstrate our success meeting those challenges, while our sales success this year with a number of marquee customers validates our vision and strategy. Despite the inherent uncertainties in the current macroeconomic environment, we remain firmly on track to deliver our revenue growth and positive cash flow objectives,” said Rajeev Singh, Accolade Chief Executive Officer.

(3) Percentages are calculated from accompanying Financial Tables and may differ from percentage change of numbers in Financial Highlights table due to rounding.

Steve Barnes, Accolade Chief Financial Officer, commented, “The first quarter of fiscal year 2023 demonstrated the predictability of Accolade’s business and our ability to flex our model to meet changing market dynamics. We outperformed our guidance on both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by focusing on the two key drivers in our financial model: customer satisfaction to drive revenue performance, and effective expense management to deliver against our bottom line goals. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance for fiscal 2023 and reaffirming our commitment to consistently improve our Adjusted EBITDA loss, with an expectation for positive cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2025.”

Financial Outlook

Accolade provides forward-looking guidance on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.

For the fiscal second quarter ending August 31, 2022, we expect:

Revenue between $82 million and $83.5 million Adjusted EBITDA between $(18) million and $(20) million

For the fiscal year ending February 28, 2023, we expect:

Revenue between $355 million and $365 million Adjusted EBITDA between $(35) million and $(40) million, representing a range of (10)% to (11)% of revenue

Accolade has not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and has not provided forward-looking guidance for net income (loss), because there are items that may impact net income (loss), including stock-based compensation, that are not within the company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine employee incentives. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we expect to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or nonrecurring items.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin

Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, and excluding stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain noncash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of noncash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related costs, goodwill impairment, and change in fair value of contingent consideration. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this measure generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations, including that they exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, whereas underlying assets may need to be replaced and result in cash capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation expense, which is a recurring charge.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our revenue to Adjusted Gross Profit:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine employee incentives. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we expect to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or nonrecurring items.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin

Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, and excluding stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain noncash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of noncash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related costs, goodwill impairment, and change in fair value of contingent consideration. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this measure generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations, including that they exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, whereas underlying assets may need to be replaced and result in cash capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation expense, which is a recurring charge.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our revenue to Adjusted Gross Profit:

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:03:00+00:00,"“Too much information” on climate change triggers cognitive biases, claims leading Professor on United Renewables podcast","DOUGLAS, Isle of Man, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- During his appearance on the latest episode of Conversations on Climate, the United Renewables podcast which focuses upon improving the quality of public discourse on the subject, Professor Likierman questioned the ‘more is better’ approach to climate communication.

‘It’s very tough, if one doesn’t know about the scientific basis, to cope with the pace of data around such a ‘complicated, fraught issue,’ he said. ‘There’s a superfluity of information – so I guess what most people would do, understandably, is to go back to the question of: who do I trust?’

Likierman – whose own research analyses the subject of judgement in corporate decision-making – connected these problems of information and trust to a range of cognitive biases identified by academic psychologists, including:

Confirmation bias: cherry-picking data or trusting intermediary authorities according to one’s existing beliefsProximity bias: over-valuing our immediate surroundings when forming judgements, and under-valuing information from geographically distant locationsScepticism of ‘motivated information’ offered by emotionally-charged communicators

Christopher Caldwell, CEO of United Renewables and the host of Conversations on Climate, responded by asking Professor Likierman where he saw ‘optimism’ in humanity’s efforts to overcome these biases.

‘There’s the intergenerational issue. It’s all very well for us, but what about the children and grandchildren?

‘The actions you take now are lagged. My sense is that’s the route through which one can appeal, in a way that doesn’t conflict with popular biases,’ answered Professor Likierman.

United Renewables – a full-lifecycle developer of green energy projects in the UK – is committing its own resources to addressing climate communication, by partnering with the London Business School to create the Conversations on Climate podcast. The series invites leading thinkers to explain and challenge existing environmental narratives, with previous guests including Professor Michael Jacobides and Ramez Nasser.

The latest episode will be released on Friday 1st July 2022. The full video of the interview will be available on the United Renewables website along with all previous episodes.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:02:18+00:00,CSL Limited's (ASX:CSL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?,"CSL (ASX:CSL) has had a rough month with its share price down 1.6%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study CSL's  ROE in this article.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

See our latest analysis for CSL

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for CSL is:

17% = US$2.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.17.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

CSL's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE

To start with, CSL's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for CSL's moderate 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.

Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that CSL's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 20% in the same period, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CSL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.

Story continues

Is CSL Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

CSL has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 44% (or a retention ratio of 56%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.

Moreover, CSL is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 40%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 20%.

Summary

In total, we are pretty happy with CSL's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:02:07+00:00,Collins Foods (ASX:CKF) Is Increasing Its Dividend To AU$0.15,"Collins Foods Limited's (ASX:CKF) dividend will be increasing to AU$0.15 on 1st of August. The announced payment will take the dividend yield to 2.7%, which is in line with the average for the industry.

See our latest analysis for Collins Foods

Collins Foods' Earnings Easily Cover the Distributions

We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Collins Foods' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.

The next year is set to see EPS grow by 6.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 59% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward. historic-dividend

Collins Foods Has A Solid Track Record

The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from AU$0.065 in 2012 to the most recent annual payment of AU$0.27. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see Collins Foods has been growing its earnings per share at 10% a year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.

Collins Foods Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock

Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Collins Foods is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.

Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Collins Foods that you should be aware of before investing. Is Collins Foods not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

By David Shepardson and Nathan Gomes

June 30 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian on Thursday apologized for recent flight cancellations and delays, as U.S. lawmakers raised questions about ongoing industry-wide disruptions.

Persistent staffing shortages and booming demand have led to frequent flight cancellations by airlines on both sides of the Atlantic, causing chaos for vacationers as the summer season swings into gear.

Delta has canceled over 400 flights since Monday - including 89 on Thursday - according to flight-tracking website Flightaware.com, as severe weather exacerbated staff shortages.

""If you've encountered delays and cancellations recently, I apologize,"" Bastian said in a LinkedIn post and email to customers. In May, Delta said it would cut about 100 daily departures to improve operations through early August.

There are increasing questions on Capitol Hill about flight disruptions.

Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday led by Representative James Comer wrote Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg seeking a staff briefing and expressing concerns the department ""does not have a serious plan to address deteriorating flight schedules.""

The Republicans asked if Buttigieg will use department tools ""to ensure the airline industry is able to operate at peak efficiency without stranding millions of families.""

Senate Budget Committee chair Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, on Tuesday urged Buttigieg ""to take immediate action to substantially reduce the number of airline cancellations and delays in our country and to protect the rights of airline passengers.""

Airlines should be fined $55,000 per passenger ""if they cancel flights that they know cannot be fully staffed,"" Sanders said.

A spokesperson for Buttigieg declined to comment but Buttigieg wrote on Twitter that ""we are engaging the airlines every day on the steps they must take to deliver this summer travel season.""

Story continues

Delta has flown over 96% of its scheduled departures in June, Bastian said, and is working to speed up hiring.

However, analysts and some industry executives do not see a meaningful improvement in conditions before fall, when travel demand tends to slow.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:01:00+00:00,"Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 - American Overseas Group Limited Announces Net Income Of $0.7 Million and Operating Income of $0.7 Million For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022","HAMILTON, Bermuda, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Overseas Group Limited (BSX: AORE.BH) (Pink Sheets: AOREF.PK) (“AOG” or the “Company”) today reported consolidated net income available to common shareholders of $0.7 million, or $15.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This compares to consolidated net income available to common shareholders of $1.0 million, or $20.81 per diluted share, for the year ended March 31, 2021. Book value per weighted share at March 31, 2022 was $850.78, a decline from the book value per weighted share of $1,055.01 at March 31, 2021.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company had an operating income of $0.7 million, or $15.30 per diluted share, compared to operating income of $0.9 million, or $19.99 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2021.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, net earned property and casualty premiums increased $0.1 million from $5.0 million a year ago to $5.1 million. Fee income remained constant at $3.3 million while gross written premiums increased $4.2 million, moving from $103.9 million to $108.1 million. Quarterly direct written premiums were positively impacted by rate increases in current business. Loss and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of earned premium increased from 54.6% to 64.2% as loss costs continued to increase in 2022 due to both frequency and severity.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, operating and acquisition expenses increased $0.4 million from $4.3 million to $4.7 million primarily driven by a one-time favorable accrual adjustment to consulting contracts in Q1 2021 of $0.2 million, and a year over year increase in acquisition, taxes, licenses and fees associated with program business written in Louisiana of $0.1 million.

As part of its ongoing capital management efforts, the Company will continue to redirect excess capital within the group to debt reduction unless other compelling opportunities present themselves.

NOTES 
(Unaudited)

Lehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint

In the second quarter of 2021, we updated our portfolio strategy to further strengthen our focus on memory and storage innovations for the data center market. In connection therewith, we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3D XPoint at scale. Accordingly, we ceased development of 3D XPoint technology and engaged in discussions with potential buyers for the sale of our facility located in Lehi that was dedicated to 3D XPoint production. As a result, we classified the property, plant, and equipment as held for sale and ceased depreciating the assets. On June 30, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Lehi facility to Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI”) and closed the sale on October 22, 2021.

In the first quarter of 2022, we received $893 million from TI for the sale of the Lehi facility and disposed of $918 million of net assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, and equipment of $921 million; $55 million of other assets, consisting primarily of a receivable for reimbursement of property taxes, equipment spare parts, and raw materials; and $58 million of liabilities, consisting primarily of a finance lease obligation. As a result of the disposition of the Lehi facility, we recognized a loss of $23 million included in restructure and asset impairments in the first quarter of 2022.

In the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a charge of $435 million included in restructure and asset impairments in connection with the definitive agreement with TI (and a tax benefit of $104 million included in income tax (provision) benefit) to write down the assets held for sale to the expected consideration, net of estimated selling costs. In the second quarter of 2021, we also recognized a charge of $49 million in cost of goods sold to write down 3D XPoint inventory in connection with our decision to cease further development of this technology.

Debt Activity

On November 1, 2021, we issued in a public offering $1.00 billion in principal amount of 2.703% senior notes due 2032 (green bonds), $500 million in principal amount of 3.366% senior notes due 2041, and $500 million in principal amount of 3.477% senior notes due 2051, and received aggregate net proceeds of $1.99 billion.

On November 17, 2021, we redeemed $1.25 billion in principal amount of our 2.497% senior notes due 2023 and $600 million in principal amount of our 4.640% senior notes due 2024 for $1.93 billion in cash and recognized a non-operating loss of $83 million.

The tables above reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP measures of gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted shares, diluted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, and net cash. The non-GAAP adjustments above may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature, but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities. We believe this non-GAAP information is helpful in understanding trends and in analyzing our operating results and earnings. We are providing this information to investors to assist in performing analysis of our operating results. When evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate our resources, management uses this non-GAAP information and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures increase transparency by providing investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling enhanced comparison of our operating results between periods and with peer companies. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. Our management excludes the following items in analyzing our operating results and understanding trends in our earnings:

Stock-based compensation;Flow-through of business acquisition-related inventory adjustments;Acquisition-related costs;Employee severance;Gains and losses from settlements and patent license charges;Restructure and asset impairments;Amortization of debt discount and other costs;Gains and losses from debt repurchases and conversions;Gains and losses from business acquisition activities; andThe estimated tax effects of above, non-cash changes in net deferred income taxes, assessments of tax exposures, certain tax matters related to prior fiscal periods, and significant changes in tax law.

Non-GAAP diluted shares are adjusted for the impact of additional shares resulting from the exclusion of stock-based compensation from non-GAAP income.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:01:00+00:00,Titan Medical Announces Appointment of Cary G. Vance as President and Chief Executive Officer,"TORONTO, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Titan Medical Inc. (Nasdaq: TMDI; TSX: TMD), a medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative surgical technologies for single access robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), today announced that Cary G. Vance has been appointed as the company’s President and CEO effective July 1, 2022. Mr. Vance will succeed Paul Cataford, Titan’s chair of the board of directors, who has served as Interim President and CEO since December 2021.

Mr. Vance previously served as President and CEO at Xcath Incorporated, a privately held neurovascular robotics company, and held similar positions at Optiscan Biomedical, and Myoscience. He also served as President and CEO at Hansen Medical, a publicly held intravascular robotics company acquired by Auris Health in 2016, which was subsequently acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2019. Prior to Hansen Medical, Mr. Vance served in various global executive leadership roles at Teleflex, Covidien (now part of Medtronic) and GE Healthcare. Mr. Vance currently serves as a director of Titan Medical, having first been elected in September 2020.

“After a thorough search and selection process using a top tier recruiting firm and advisor, and after completing a rigorous leadership requirement and assessment analysis, we are pleased to announce that we have selected Cary as our next President and CEO. Cary brings extensive expertise and insights in robotic medical technology and minimally invasive surgery, filling this key leadership role,” said Paul Cataford, Titan’s Interim President and CEO. “It was during the interim management period and the interviewing and assessment of a number of candidates that we determined the final requirements for our next President and CEO, and Cary emerged as the best candidate.”

“I am excited to transition from an oversight position on Titan’s board to an executive position leading the company. I am already familiar with the team and the complexity of the product and the regulatory process, and will be able to take over from Paul quickly and effectively. Having Paul remain as a resource on the board and as chair made it easy to accept the appointment,” said Mr. Vance. “Titan’s innovative technology offers a compelling value proposition for patients, surgeons and hospitals and should enhance the care paradigm for patients seeking minimally invasive surgery through a single access point. I look forward to working with our talented and passionate team as we continue to evolve our business and commercialize our technology. Additionally, I look forward to interacting with investors during our next quarterly financial update.”

Paul Cataford will continue to serve on Titan’s board of directors as board chair. As the board chair is now independent, with Mr. Cataford having served less than 12 months as an interim executive, a lead independent is no longer required.

NOTES 
(Unaudited)

Lehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint

In the second quarter of 2021, we updated our portfolio strategy to further strengthen our focus on memory and storage innovations for the data center market. In connection therewith, we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3D XPoint at scale. Accordingly, we ceased development of 3D XPoint technology and engaged in discussions with potential buyers for the sale of our facility located in Lehi that was dedicated to 3D XPoint production. As a result, we classified the property, plant, and equipment as held for sale and ceased depreciating the assets. On June 30, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Lehi facility to Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI”) and closed the sale on October 22, 2021.

In the first quarter of 2022, we received $893 million from TI for the sale of the Lehi facility and disposed of $918 million of net assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, and equipment of $921 million; $55 million of other assets, consisting primarily of a receivable for reimbursement of property taxes, equipment spare parts, and raw materials; and $58 million of liabilities, consisting primarily of a finance lease obligation. As a result of the disposition of the Lehi facility, we recognized a loss of $23 million included in restructure and asset impairments in the first quarter of 2022.

In the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a charge of $435 million included in restructure and asset impairments in connection with the definitive agreement with TI (and a tax benefit of $104 million included in income tax (provision) benefit) to write down the assets held for sale to the expected consideration, net of estimated selling costs. In the second quarter of 2021, we also recognized a charge of $49 million in cost of goods sold to write down 3D XPoint inventory in connection with our decision to cease further development of this technology.

Debt Activity

On November 1, 2021, we issued in a public offering $1.00 billion in principal amount of 2.703% senior notes due 2032 (green bonds), $500 million in principal amount of 3.366% senior notes due 2041, and $500 million in principal amount of 3.477% senior notes due 2051, and received aggregate net proceeds of $1.99 billion.

On November 17, 2021, we redeemed $1.25 billion in principal amount of our 2.497% senior notes due 2023 and $600 million in principal amount of our 4.640% senior notes due 2024 for $1.93 billion in cash and recognized a non-operating loss of $83 million.

The tables above reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP measures of gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted shares, diluted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, and net cash. The non-GAAP adjustments above may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature, but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities. We believe this non-GAAP information is helpful in understanding trends and in analyzing our operating results and earnings. We are providing this information to investors to assist in performing analysis of our operating results. When evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate our resources, management uses this non-GAAP information and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures increase transparency by providing investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling enhanced comparison of our operating results between periods and with peer companies. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. Our management excludes the following items in analyzing our operating results and understanding trends in our earnings:

Stock-based compensation; Flow-through of business acquisition-related inventory adjustments; Acquisition-related costs; Employee severance; Gains and losses from settlements and patent license charges; Restructure and asset impairments; Amortization of debt discount and other costs; Gains and losses from debt repurchases and conversions; Gains and losses from business acquisition activities; and The estimated tax effects of above, non-cash changes in net deferred income taxes, assessments of tax exposures, certain tax matters related to prior fiscal periods, and significant changes in tax law.

Non-GAAP diluted shares are adjusted for the impact of additional shares resulting from the exclusion of stock-based compensation from non-GAAP income.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:01:00+00:00,Titan Medical Announces Appointment of Cary G. Vance as President and Chief Executive Officer,"Titan Medical Inc.

TORONTO, June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Titan Medical Inc. (Nasdaq: TMDI; TSX: TMD), a medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative surgical technologies for single access robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), today announced that Cary G. Vance has been appointed as the company’s President and CEO effective July 1, 2022. Mr. Vance will succeed Paul Cataford, Titan’s chair of the board of directors, who has served as Interim President and CEO since December 2021.

Mr. Vance previously served as President and CEO at Xcath Incorporated, a privately held neurovascular robotics company, and held similar positions at Optiscan Biomedical, and Myoscience. He also served as President and CEO at Hansen Medical, a publicly held intravascular robotics company acquired by Auris Health in 2016, which was subsequently acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2019. Prior to Hansen Medical, Mr. Vance served in various global executive leadership roles at Teleflex, Covidien (now part of Medtronic) and GE Healthcare. Mr. Vance currently serves as a director of Titan Medical, having first been elected in September 2020.

“After a thorough search and selection process using a top tier recruiting firm and advisor, and after completing a rigorous leadership requirement and assessment analysis, we are pleased to announce that we have selected Cary as our next President and CEO. Cary brings extensive expertise and insights in robotic medical technology and minimally invasive surgery, filling this key leadership role,” said Paul Cataford, Titan’s Interim President and CEO. “It was during the interim management period and the interviewing and assessment of a number of candidates that we determined the final requirements for our next President and CEO, and Cary emerged as the best candidate.”

“I am excited to transition from an oversight position on Titan’s board to an executive position leading the company. I am already familiar with the team and the complexity of the product and the regulatory process, and will be able to take over from Paul quickly and effectively. Having Paul remain as a resource on the board and as chair made it easy to accept the appointment,” said Mr. Vance. “Titan’s innovative technology offers a compelling value proposition for patients, surgeons and hospitals and should enhance the care paradigm for patients seeking minimally invasive surgery through a single access point. I look forward to working with our talented and passionate team as we continue to evolve our business and commercialize our technology. Additionally, I look forward to interacting with investors during our next quarterly financial update.”

Story continues

Paul Cataford will continue to serve on Titan’s board of directors as board chair. As the board chair is now independent, with Mr. Cataford having served less than 12 months as an interim executive, a lead independent is no longer required.

SAN DIEGO, June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer, today announced that Brian T. Powl has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Powl brings to Fate Therapeutics extensive commercial leadership experience in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, having previously served as the Global Commercial CAR T lead at Celgene Corporation where he oversaw the commercial development strategy of the company’s CAR T-cell therapies.

“We are excited to welcome Brian to Fate Therapeutics as we begin to chart our late-stage clinical development and product launch pathways across our iPSC-derived cell product franchises in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “His leadership and demonstrated success in developing and implementing commercial launch strategies for novel product candidates, including for autologous CAR T-cell therapies in the fields of lymphoma and myeloma, uniquely complement our existing team’s expertise and add a set of highly relevant insights and experiences as we seek to maximize the potential of our off-the-shelf cell product pipeline.”

Mr. Powl most recently served as Senior Vice President, Commercial Development & Marketing at MEI Pharma, Inc., where he led the commercialization efforts of a late-stage small molecule program in B-cell malignancies across marketing, sales, market access and commercial operations. Prior to MEI Pharma, Mr. Powl was Vice President, Global Commercial CAR T lead at Celgene Corporation, where he oversaw a global portfolio of new cell therapy products, including the commercialization of the CD19- and BCMA-targeted CAR T-cell therapy programs.

Prior to Celgene, Mr. Powl held sales and marketing positions at Novartis Oncology and Centocor, Inc. Mr. Powl holds a BS in Biochemistry from the University of California, San Diego and an MBA in Healthcare Management/Marketing from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

“Off-the-shelf cell products offer a highly-differentiated value proposition, including the potential to reach and bring therapeutic benefit to patients in the community setting as part of standard immunochemotherapy treatment regimens,” said Mr. Powl. “I look forward to leveraging my CAR T-cell commercial development experiences in lymphoma and myeloma, and contributing to the advancement of the Company’s robust pipeline of multiplexed-engineered, iPSC-derived NK and T-cell product candidates for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.”

In connection with his commencement of employment, Fate Therapeutics granted Mr. Powl an option to purchase 70,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price equal to $26.25, the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock as reported by NASDAQ on June 27, 2022, which was the date of commencement of Mr. Powl’s employment with the Company and the effective date of grant. The option is a non-qualified stock option and vests over a period of four years, with twenty-five percent vesting on the one-year anniversary of the grant date and the remaining seventy-five percent vesting in approximately equal monthly increments over the succeeding thirty-six months, subject to Mr. Powl’s continuous employment through each vesting date. In addition, Fate Therapeutics granted Mr. Powl an award of 45,000 restricted stock units, with each restricted stock unit equal to one share of the Company’s common stock. The restricted stock units vest in four equal annual installments on each anniversary following July 1, 2022, subject to Mr. Powl’s continuous employment through each vesting date.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:00:44+00:00,UPDATE 1-U.S. gives NFG more time to build Northern Access natgas pipeline,"(Adds comment from NFG)

June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have given National Fuel Gas Co (NFG) more time to build its proposed Northern Access natural gas pipeline project in Pennsylvania and New York.

The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Wednesday approved NFG's January request for a 35-month extension to build the project by December 2024.

Northern Access is one of several fossil fuel projects held up by regulators in New York over the past several years. Others include Williams Cos Inc's Northeast Supply Enhancement and Constitution gas pipelines.

""Due to the passage of time, including extensive litigation delays, we are in the process of evaluating our next steps,"" NFG spokesperson Karen Merkel said, noting she could not comment on the current expected cost of the project.

When first proposed, NFG expected the project to cost about $500 million.

FERC approved the project in February 2017 and said NFG had to put it in service by February 2019.

NFG, however, did not build the project because it could not get a water quality certificate from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).

In November 2018, NFG asked FERC for more time to complete construction due to the delay in getting the water quality certificate. In January 2019, FERC gave NFG until February 2022 to finish the project.

In October 2020, NFG asked FERC for another extension until December 2024 to complete the project, but FERC dismissed that request as premature.

NFG made the current request for more time to finish the project in January 2022 after a court determined the NYSDEC waived its water quality certification authority by waiting too long to act on the company's request.

Northern Access, which includes a 99-mile (159-km) pipeline, is designed to deliver about 0.49 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania to New York.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:00:41+00:00,Shiba Inu Saves Market’s Face With a 2% Uptick While ETH Falls by 7%,"Key Insights:

Shiba Inu was the only crypto to have substantial growth in the last 24 hours. Ethereum continued its week-long streak of red candles marking a 17% decline. Bitcoin fell below the $20k mark at the time of writing.

The crypto market was expected to be in recovery by this week, but after a decent rise throughout last week, the market caved, and altcoins sank again.

Currently, only Shiba Inu is heading the few altcoins that are still in the green, the rest of the altcoins are following their king.

Not Bitcoin, the Other King

The altcoins king, Ethereum, is making no different moves than the rest of the market, and neither has it been doing that for the past few days.

This is because the asset is currently only dependent on the broader market cues since, in itself, Ethereum’s ecosystem isn’t going through any significant development.

Thus, over the last four days, ETH has declined by more than 17% and is going to continue going down that path.

This is because price indicators are flashing clear indications of a downfall, with the Parabolic SAR already exhibiting an active downtrend given the presence of the white dot above the candlestick.

Secondly, the MACD is highlighting a bearish crossover taking place over the new couple of days, with the red bars indicating the rise of bearish pressure.

Already trading at $1032 at the time of writing, ETH is inching closer to losing the $1k mark and depreciating further.

Shiba Inu Rises, Albeit a Little

When the entire market is noting price falls and the only coins to do well are closing at +0.4%, a 2% rise is enough to leave a mark, and that is precisely what Shiba Inu did. Despite having no bullish support from the market, SHIB managed to close in green at $0.00001024.

Although this is the most, it will be able to achieve since a 15.52% decline from the 48 hours before yesterday has a stronger influence on the asset.

For now, the 53.32% recovery is safe from being wholly invalidated since price indicators aren’t indicating a sudden drop in price.

Story continues

The 50-day Moving Average, although it acts as resistance, isn’t too far away from the candlestick. Secondly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is teetering at the edge of flipping into the bearish zone. But as long as it can keep at the neutral line, SHIB will be safe from a severe price swing.

By Stephen Culp

NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended the session lower on Thursday, crossing the finish line of a grim month and quarter, a dismal coda to the S&P 500's worst first half in more than half a century.

All three major U.S. stock indexes finished the month and the second quarter in negative territory, with the S&P 500 notching its steepest first-half percentage drop since 1970.

The Nasdaq had its largest-ever January-June percentage drop, while the Dow suffered its biggest first-half percentage plunge since 1962.

All three indexes posted their second straight quarterly declines. The last time that happened was in 2015 for the S&P and the Dow, and 2016 for the Nasdaq.

The year began with spiking cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant. Then came Russia's invasion of Ukraine, decades-high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which have stoked fears of a possible recession.

""All year it’s been a tug-of-war between inflation and slowing growth, balancing tightening financial conditions to address inflation concerns but trying to avoid outright panic,"" said Paul Kim, chief executive officer at Simplify ETFs in New York. ""I think we are more than likely already in a recession and right now the only question is how harsh will the recession be?""

""I think it’s very unlikely that we’ll see a soft landing,"" Kim added.

Economic data released on Thursday did little to allay those fears. Disposable income inched lower, consumer spending decelerated, inflation remained hot and jobless claims inched higher.

""We’ve started to see a slowdown in consumer spending,"" Said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""And it seems that inflation is taking its toll on the average consumer and that translates to corporate earnings which is what ultimately drives the stock market.""

The graphic below shows year-on-year growth of core inflation indicators, all of which suggest that while a peak appears to have been reached in March, they all continue to soar well above the Fed's average annual 2% target:

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 32.58 points, or 0.85%, to end at 3,786.25 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 146.95 points, or 1.31%, to 11,030.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 219.61 points, or 0.71%, to 30,809.70.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, energy is only one showing a year-to-date gain, aided by crude prices spiking over supply concerns due to Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The major stock indexes showed monthly losses, with the S&P 500 logging its largest June percentage decline since the financial crisis.

Second-quarter reporting season begins in several weeks, and 130 of the companies in the S&P 500 have pre-announced. Of those, 45 have been positive and 77 have been negative, resulting in a negative/positive ratio of 1.7 stronger than the first quarter but weaker than a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

Worries over inflation dampening consumer demand and threatening profit margins will have market participants listening closely to forward guidance.

Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc fell after its quarterly profit plunged 76%, hurt by its opioid settlement with Florida and a decrease in U.S. pharmacy sales on waning demand for COVID-19 vaccinations.

Worries about the fallout from the conflict in Ukraine, and surging inflation causing aggressive central bank moves, have kept investors jittery so far this year. ""A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions is becoming more visible in emerging markets, raising the level of investor unease,"" said Alejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer, EM Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management. MSCI's index of emerging market stocks is down about 19% since the beginning of the year, its worst first-half on record. Its currencies counterpart's 4% slide is its worst since the first six months of the pandemic ravaged 2020 . But in the light of economic uncertainties, emerging market assets offer portfolios an inexpensive way to diversify compared with developed market assets, Czerwonko said. ""While U.S. stocks have only recently reached long-term valuation averages, emerging market equities are already trading at an 11x forward price-to-earnings ratio, well below their 10-year mean."" In Latam, stocks slipped, with Brazil's benchmark index down 1.3%, as Wall Street looked to end the last session of one of its worst first halves in the red. Over the quarter, Chile's index was on track to end about 0.8% higher, outperforming not just regional peers, but broader emerging markets whose quarterly losses were only topped by the slide in March 2020. Colombia's index lost 0.7% on Thursday after the central bank raised interest rates by 150 basis points to 7.50%, as expected, as the battle against inflation continued. In what could further bolster Colombia's currency when it reacts to the decision on Friday, the bank raised its economic growth outlook for 2022 to 6.3%, from 5.0% previously. Colombia's leftist President-elect Gustavo Petro picked market-friendly Jose Antonio Ocampo to be finance minister. ""It may be a positive thing for the country that Petro is choosing a very mixed cabinet. So that, in long term, will help the Colombian peso,"" Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Monex USA, said. Brazil's real fell 0.8%. Its central bank expects 12-month inflation to decelerate to 11.31% in August from 11.73% in May, in line with its expectation that inflation will have peaked. The real was on course for a near 10% quarterly slide, compared with a 1.4% slide in the Mexican peso.

AAPL,2022-06-30T20:00:09+00:00,Access to CASE IH Machinery Heralds New Era for Somali Farmers,"Northampton, MA --News Direct-- CNH Industrial ACCESS TO CASE IH MACHINERY HERALDS NEW ERA FOR SOMALI FARMERS

June 30, 2022 /3BL Media/ - CNH Industrial has signed a trailblazing import and distribution agreement with Gaalooge Farming & Livestock Cooperative for CASE IH products in Somalia. Following decades of setbacks and severely challenging circumstances, thanks to this recently signed agreement, farmers in Somalia can now look forward to accessing reliable new machinery, as well as service and parts support.

Sustainable growth

For many years these farmers have only been able to import used machinery for their farms. Additionally, farmers and rural communities have endured debilitating droughts and decades of civil war, the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic challenges, and a recent desert locust upsurge. Attention is now focused on how the country´s private sector can drive and sustain agricultural growth in a country that relies on agricultural production. Key requirements for boosting agricultural investment in Somalia are to better exploit international and regional linkages and create strategic partnerships for sustained national growth.

The beginning

The Gaalooge-Case IH partnership was initiated at the Italy-Somalia Business Forum in Mogadishu in December 2019 where negotiations were supported by teams of experts from the Enterprise Development Units in Somalia and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Somalia Programme.

Gaalooge, based in Baidoa, Somalia, is registered as a cooperative under the local Ministries of Commerce and Agriculture. Owned by a group of Somali farmers, it is a dedicated agro-business enterprise actively involved in the production and distribution of a variety of agricultural inputs and farm machinery throughout the country.

“The new partnership enables, for the first time in recent history, the supply of new agricultural machinery to Somalia. Case IH, a brand of CNH Industrial, with its distinctive red livery and world famous reputation for reliability, is the brand of farm machinery that Somali farmers will employ on their farms. Case IH tractors and equipment, including combine harvesters, are held in high regard throughout Africa, with proven performance in the toughest conditions” says Adam Mohamed, Gaalooge’s CEO.

Agricultural environment

Somalia has considerable productive resources, which offer huge potential for delivering rapid economic growth, with important impacts on people’s livelihoods. These resources include 8.5 million hectares of arable land, more than 50 million livestock and about 1.8 million tons of fish annually for export. However, only 2.3 million hectares are under rainfed agriculture plus another 630,000 hectares under irrigation.

With the agricultural sector renowned for being one of the best drivers to improve livelihoods and to take national economies forward quickly and effectively, this new partnership represents a key step in rebuilding the country of Somalia.

OAKLAND, Calif., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--It’s critical to put safety first this Fourth of July with the triple digit heat combined with extremely dry conditions from an extended drought and climate change.

Celebrations that involve fireworks, barbeques and swimming can increase the risk of fires, electric hazards, heat-related illnesses, and other perils. Echoing recommendations from first responders, PG&E asks customers to follow local rules and regulations regarding fireworks.

Here are additional ways to stay safe this summer:

Electric Safety

The safest way to enjoy fireworks is to attend a public fireworks show put on by professionals. First and foremost, know what the local regulations allow. Be aware of surroundings — stay clear of power lines, structures, dry grass, or flammable materials when using legally purchased fireworks in areas approved by local regulations. If a firework strikes electric equipment or causes a power line to come down, stay away, keep others away and immediately call 9-1-1 and PG&E at 1-800-743-5000. Always assume downed electric lines are energized and extremely dangerous. Never attempt to retrieve anything that is tangled in or near a power line.

Summer Safety

Make sure everyone has proper skills to swim. Keep an eye on young children and check flotation devices for leaks. Every child under 13 must wear a Coast Guard-approved life jacket when on a moving vessel that is 26 feet or less in length. Don't dive or jump into unfamiliar water. Shallow water or submerged trees or rocks could cause serious injury. Don't swim or play near a dam or powerhouse; these areas can have strong underwater currents, sudden water discharges, slippery surfaces and submerged hazards. Never use generators, propane heaters, barbeques or charcoal indoors due to carbon monoxide risks.

Heat Safety

Limit exposure to direct sunlight. Reapply sunscreen often. Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol or caffeine when temperatures are high. During hot weather, watch for signs of heat stroke — hot, red skin; changes in consciousness; rapid, weak pulse; or rapid, shallow breathing. If you suspect someone is suffering from heat stroke, call 9-1-1 and move the person to a cooler place. Use cold towels to help lower their body temperature until help arrives.

Democrats Weigh Paring Biden Tax Hike to Win Over Manchin The Wheels Have Come Off Electric Vehicles Supreme Court Crimps Biden’s Climate Agenda With Limits on EPA Stock Doomsayers Vindicated in Historic First Half: Markets Wrap Trump’s Final Scene Didn’t Go According to Script

Colombia’s central bank delivered its biggest interest rate increase in over two decades, potentially putting itself on a collision course with President-elect Gustavo Petro, though it signaled the pace may not be kept in future decisions.

The board unanimously raised rates by 150 basis points to 7.5%, Governor Leonardo Villar told reporters after a policy meeting Thursday. That’s the largest hike since the bank implemented its inflation-targeting strategy in 1999.

The decision was correctly forecast by 15 of 24 economists in a Bloomberg survey, including those from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Credit Suisse Group AG. Barclays Plc and five other forecasters saw a full percentage point hike, while two expected a boost of 125 basis points, and one an increase of 75 basis points.

Policy makers won’t necessarily raise borrowing costs by the same amount going forward, Finance Minister Jose Manuel Restrepo, who sits on the bank’s board, told reporters after the decision. In an accompanying statement, board members wrote that the pace of monetary policy adjustments will depend on available information.

This is the first rate decision since Petro won the presidency earlier this month. The peso has sold off since the June 19 vote, making imports even pricier, while financial markets remained concerned about the leftist leader’s plans to end new oil exploration and overhaul pensions.

Colombian policy makers are bracing for another spike in annual inflation that’s already above 9%. Cost of living increases have been propelled by higher raw material prices and strong activity. Fuel will become more expensive in coming months as the government phases out subsidies.

What Bloomberg Economics Says

“Policy makers anticipated more hikes and emphasized the number and magnitude will depend on new information. While another 150-bp hike at the July meeting can’t be ruled out, policy makers made an effort in the post-meeting press conference to limit expectations, suggesting the bar is high and they may prefer to return to smaller hikes.”

-- Felipe Hernandez, Latin America economist

Click here to read the full report.

Policy makers across Latin America are being compelled to extend their monetary tightening campaigns as the US Federal Reserve starts its own cycle of interest rate increases. With today’s decision, Colombia has increased borrowing costs by 575 basis points since September -- more than Mexico and Peru though much less than Chile and Brazil.

During the presidential campaign, Petro criticized interest rate increases, saying they will hurt economic growth and the labor market. He worried investors by saying some sectors of the economy should have seats on the bank’s board, and that policy makers should also look to fight inequality.

Yet this week Petro named renowned economist Jose Antonio Ocampo as finance minister, in a signal he is moving to calm investors. Ocampo, 69, will also have a seat on the bank’s board after resigning in January 2020 when he was a co-director at the institution.

Restrictive Policy

In the press conference following the rate decision, Villar told reporters that Ocampo had been his professor. When asked what message he would like to send the upcoming finance minister, he said it’s urgent to bring inflation back down to target.

“To bring inflation to 3%, hopefully faster than what is reflected today in analysts’ and the markets’ expectations, it is not enough to adjust toward levels considered neutral,” Villar said. “But rather, it might be necessary to move toward a situation where monetary policy is contractionary.”

Colombia’s central bank doesn’t provide forward guidance about how far the tightening cycle will go, as it can send wrong messages to investors and conditions are changing rapidly, Villar added.

Colombia’s annual inflation eased to 9.07% in May, but it’s still way above the central bank’s target of 3%. Consumer prices likely rebounded to 9.74% this month, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey.

The International Monetary Fund sees Colombia’s gross domestic product expanding 5.8% this year, more than any other major Latin American economy. The nation’s current account deficit is one of the largest in emerging markets.

MELBOURNE, Fla., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) infrared instrument set to launch June 30 will significantly improve the ability to capture high-resolution imagery and other important battlefield information from space – a critical capability for the nation’s future missile defense efforts.

L3Harris is providing the instrument as part of a wide-field-of-view satellite that also will help inform future space-based missile defense missions and architectures. The satellite will be positioned 22,000 miles from Earth, enabling the infrared system to see a wide swath and patrol a large area for potential missile launches.

""The L3Harris instrument can stare continuously at a theater of interest to provide ongoing information about the battlespace, which is an improvement over legacy systems,"" said Ed Zoiss, President, Space & Airborne Systems, L3Harris. ""It also provides better resolution, sensitivity and target discrimination at a lower cost.""

The instrument was built for Space Systems Command and is integrated into a Millennium Space Systems satellite, scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The payload, which is more than six feet tall and weighs more than 365 pounds, was developed in Wilmington, Mass.

L3Harris is prioritizing investments in space-based missile defense programs and has accelerated the development of resilient, end-to-end satellite solutions in spacecraft, payloads and ground software, and advanced algorithms.

In a related effort, the Missile Defense Agency awarded L3Harris a missile-tracking study contract in 2019 and the prototype demonstration in January 2021.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:49:25+00:00,Biden administration weighs stablecoin regulation outside of traditional banks,"The President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets is open to regulating stablecoin issuers through methods other than as banks, according to an administration official.

The PWG – a group composed of the heads of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, among other financial regulatory bodies – met in a closed door meeting Thursday morning.

The group discussed oversight of stablecoins following the run on TerraUSD, which caused shockwaves in crypto markets in early May.

This meeting also comes as negotiations over legislation to regulate stablecoins intensify on Capitol Hill. According to an administration official, there is a concerted effort to get stablecoin legislation done this year.

The PWG initially recommended last fall that only banks, which are subject to more rigorous oversight and regulation, should be allowed to issue stablecoins.

Now, however, officials are open to exploring other models outside of insured depository institutions, including a remote subsidiary option. This is the first time the administration has acknowledged a model outside of traditional banks that could suffice. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar.

The PWG feels any legislation has to reflect how stablecoins are used today and how they may be used in the future, according to the administration official, including as a form of payment.

Any legislation would need to preserve the existing authorities of regulators at the very least. The financial agency heads feel that the status quo is unacceptable and are working together to offer constructive feedback to lawmakers.

Evolving plans in Congress

The meeting comes as a new legislative effort is emerging in the House Financial Services Committee by Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and ranking member Patrick McHenry (R-NC) to regulate stablecoins.

This follows two bills in the Senate: a comprehensive bill put forth by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirstin Gillibrand (D-NY) that would not require that all stablecoin issuers become banks overseen by banking regulations. Instead, the bill would require stablecoins to be 100% backed by reserve-like assets, such as Treasuries or dollars, and include detailed disclosure requirements for all issuers to guarantee that stablecoin holders can redeem the stablecoin in exchange for the equivalent dollar value at any time.

Story continues

Another draft proposal, by Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), would create a new federal license to allow companies to issue stablecoins while still allowing for the state-registered money transmitter status for many existing stablecoin issuers, or insured depository institutions to issue stablecoins. Senator Pat Toomey in Washington, D.C.,U.S., May 10, 2022. Tom Williams/Pool via REUTERS

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group composed of heads of all financial regulatory agencies formed following the financial crisis to keep a pulse on threats to the financial system, continues to keep an eye on stablecoins and the potential threat they pose to the financial system. The group has not made a decision on whether to take action yet, and still favors legislation as the best way to police stablecoins.

The meeting comes following a run on stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna shook crypto markets in early May. Crypto markets have been under pressure for much of 2022, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) both trading at their lowest levels since late 2020.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:47:07+00:00,GoDaddy (GDDY) to Grow Portfolio Offerings Via Dan.com Buyout,"GoDaddy Inc. GDDY is consistently working toward strengthening its domain offerings on the back of strategic acquisitions.

This is evident from GDDY’s recent agreement to acquire Dan.com, a company catering to the needs of the domain industry.

With the takeover of Dan.com, GDDY will incorporate the automation of the former and lease into its capabilities to provide advanced services to its customers.

The acquisition is expected to be complete during the third quarter of this year.

Efforts to Gain Domain Market Share

Apart from the recent move, GDDY acquired DNAcademy in March to expand their features for providing a premium domain-buying experience to customers.

Further, GoDaddy offers robust privacy and protection tools for eligible domains to protect customer information and prevent spams.

These efforts are expected to continue helping GoDaddy expand its presence in the booming domain name registrar market.

The underlined market is witnessing significant growth in recent times, thanks to the increasing efforts by companies in expanding their online market presence. Global brands tend to take premium domain names to strengthen their position and gain momentum among customers.

Per a straits research report, the global domain name registrar market is likely to witness a CAGR of 5.18% between 2021 and 2027.

The acquisition is anticipated to further aid GoDaddy in penetrating the global web hosting services market, which includes the domain register market.

The global web hosting services market is expected to reach $267.1 billion in 2028, seeing a CAGR of 18.0% from 2021 to 2028, according to a Fortune Business Insights report.

Portfolio Strength

The takeover of Dan.com is likely to bode well with GoDaddy’s growing efforts toward increasing its portfolio of solutions.

Apart from the latest step, in March, GDDY launched its Websites + Marketing Commerce Plus plan equipped with Avalara AvaTax, an automated sales tax solution for small businesses. The solution automates the e-commerce sales tax process and keeps a track of transaction thresholds without the need for manual intervention.

Story continues

In June, GoDaddy strengthened its free GoDaddy Studio app with the Link in Bio feature. The capability helps businesses and entrepreneurs promote their online store sites and social platforms.

In February, GDDY released QR codes for on-the-go transactions to help small business owners with faster and seamless e-commerce and in-person payments.

These growing initiatives are likely to continue helping GoDaddy attract more customers, thereby contributing to its top-line growth.

This, in turn, is expected to help GDDY win the confidence of investors in the near and long term.

Shares of GDDY have been down 17.1% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 29.9%.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:46:03+00:00,"Bitcoin: Likely some ‘price memory’ if it falls below $14,000, crypto CEO says","Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook on the crypto markets, FTX's presence in the exchange place, and bitcoin's pricing.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Here's some breaking news in the crypto space. BlockFi CEO Zac Prince tweeting just minutes ago that the firm is not being sold for $25 million. This is responding to earlier reports that the struggling crypto lender is close to being bought by FTX's CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. We want to talk a little bit more about what's going on in this space.

We have Cory Klippsten. He is the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. And, Cory, first, your reaction to this news. Because we talk so much about the consolidation that we are seeing in this space after this massive sell-off that we've seen in Bitcoin and a number of the other coins. Sam Bankman-Fried now reportedly eyeing another acquisition. What do you think?

CORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah, it's pretty fascinating to watch this all play out. And by the way, thank you so much for having me on. And yeah, so we had, obviously, broad markets pull back basically the entire year. We know that crypto and Bitcoin are cross-owned by a lot of larger players this cycle versus previous cycles. So it's not sort of just a retail-driven market anymore.

So you basically had the whole crypto industry being kind of risk-on, risk being turned off, and so those prices got pulled down. And what it did when the tide started to go out is it exposed the extremely risky operations and sort of investment and risk management practices of a lot of players in the space. So not only were the coins themselves dropping in price, but, essentially, all this leverage that had been piled on by what's been sort of referred to as the CFi lenders in particular, a business model that's really exploded in the last two or three years with venture capital-- and sort of Uber and WeWork style venture capital funding of their growth models, which turned out to be unprofitable and extremely risky if they were going to keep growing.

Story continues

So that's essentially what we see. This is kind of like a symptom at first of the prices dropping, but then it's become a massive accelerant over the last five or six weeks or so. And this goes for Celsius, BlockFi, Abra, Nexo, all these companies in that kind of category of doing the CFi lending thing.

DAVE BRIGGS: That reported $25 million purchase price would have marked 99% down from their most recent valuation. In regard to Sam Bankman-Fried, who I'm going to go with SBF for this purpose-- buying up all these companies, lending money to others. We talked to David Traynor earlier this week, he's the CEO of New Constructs. Here's what he said about this recent phenomenon, and then I want to get your reaction. Listen.

DAVID TRAYNOR: FTX is trying to save themselves by propping up these other zombie businesses. I mean, this is like AOL buying Moviefone.

DAVE BRIGGS: Now, that was in reaction to reports they might buy Robinhood, a notion they've pushed back on. Nonetheless, it continues to be rumored about every couple of days that FTX might bail somebody out. What do you make of that sentiment there?

CORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah. I mean, they make so much money being a counterparty and a market participant with these businesses, speaking of FTX, and, frankly, of Alameda Research, the other side of the house-- that's the market maker that actually trades on their own exchanges against their customers and participates in all these other exchanges doing arbitrage around the world. Even if you just take a look at, like, Sam Bankman-Fried's net worth on his own, it's worth it to him to spend even, say, $1 billion or $2 of his own money to sort of prop these things up, because it will be actually accretive to his net worth or it'll make his own personal net worth go down less.

So it isn't some sort of, like, altruism to try to prop these things up. It's a very selfish maneuver.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as we look at people who are, essentially, tearing their hair out at this point who have money in exchanges like Celsius-- we're seeing these freezes, they're not able to transfer-- what do people need to understand about any sort of recourse they can get from these crypto exchanges that are either freezing transfers or going bankrupt?

CORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah. So I want to make a very clear distinction between a crypto exchange like a Coinbase, or a Kraken, or an FTX, which actually matches orders and doesn't rehypothecate your coins and lend them out without your knowledge-- I shouldn't say without your knowledge, people have been signing these contracts with the CFi lenders-- but this business model that kind of erupted in the last couple of years was saying, hey, buy some Bitcoin or buy some crypto with us, and then you can actually make interest on that-- essentially, referring to people as depositors, but in the fine print pointing out by depositors, we don't mean depositors.

You're actually an unsecured creditor and we go out the back end with your money and conduct market operations. We can put it in DeFi protocols that get hacked and put it in anchor in the Luna UST ecosystem and narrowly escape with over half a billion dollars of user funds, like Celsius did a day before that collapsed. You know, so they could kind of do whatever they want.

And essentially, the warning that I've been giving for years on all of these businesses to their users is that you're being dramatically under-compensated for the risk. This model of lending to essentially a trading operation-- as an equity partner, you would be an LP in a hedge fund and you should get 80% of the profits. If you're actually lending to a hedge fund, frankly, the only ones that can borrow at decent rates would be really well-established hedge funds with real traders, not the kinds of backgrounds of the people that are running these CFi lenders for the most part.

And even then, you'd be looking at sort of, like, high end mezzanine rates of 1% to 1.5% per month-- 12% to 18%, something like that. So dramatically under-compensated for the risks that they're taking with your coins. And I think you're just seeing it all kind of collapse.

SEANA SMITH: Speaking of collapse, the recent collapse of Terra, the liquidity issues that we have been talking about-- we've heard this call even from people inside your industry saying that we need to see some regulation when it comes to crypto in terms of when we talk about mainstream adoption, that that really needs to happen in order to see wider adoption of this. From your perspective, what would you like to see from the regulation front?

CORY KLIPPSTEN: Well, I think it's important to just not be hypocritical. So if something is actually operating as a bank, like these CFi lenders have been, they should be regulated as banks. Or you should deregulate banks. I don't think you can have it both ways.

And similarly, taking the 150-some essentially unregistered securities with centralized teams trying to increase the price of their coin or whatever on Coinbase, those are, obviously-- pass all four prongs of the Howey test and are securities by the laws that we have on the books. So I think if you're principled and not a hypocrite, you have to either argue for the abolition of the SEC, and the deregulation of Ponzi schemes targeting your grandma, and you need to be in favor of penny stock operators sending direct mail to nursing homes, or you need to regulate these penny stock cryptos on Coinbase the same way that you do securities.

DAVE BRIGGS: And, finally, the B over your left shoulder has not fallen off the wall, thankfully. It has fallen in recent days, though. We're talking 6% down about today, and down 60% year-to-date. What's a realistic bottom for you for Bitcoin?

CORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah. I mean, I don't know that it matters that much because it's fallen so much at this point, people are kind of used to it. I think people would-- like, even the staunchest of bitcoiners would start to get kind of a knot in their gut if you saw four-figure Bitcoin, like sub-$10K. But I think the people that are hodling here in $17, $18, $19, $20 range are still going to be buying if they see something like-- I think the close of the week back in 2017 was $13,800, and that was also the high in the sort of precursor run-up in June of 2019. I think we hit $13,800 on June 26 of 2019 if I recall.

So it feels like there's some price memory somewhere in the high $13s. And you know, I'd probably start to feel it a little bit below that. But anything sort of above $13,800, $14,000, something like that just feels like a really good time to be picking up some cheap Bitcoin.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Cory, for retail investors who are seeing some of these headlines about some of these exchanges, and, as you mentioned, perhaps not really differentiating between some that act more like a CD account, what is the safest place to keep your crypto right now?

CORY KLIPPSTEN: Yeah. So I mean, I fully believe in Bitcoin as a self-sovereign money. At Swan.com, that's everything that we teach, and we preach, and we educate people about is taking custody. I think what you want to make sure of, though, is even if you are using an exchange, and you're not taking self-custody, and you're leaving it with a custodian, just make sure that setup is good.

And don't sign something that lets them go and rehypothecate their coins-- meaning don't let them go lend out your coins. The risk-reward is not worth it. It never has been. And I think that's being laid obviously bare today. So just make sure that it's in a user-segregated account that only you can remove the coins and that you didn't sign something that said that they can go and trade them for you.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Do your homework. Thank you so much. Cory Klippsten there, Swan Bitcoin CEO.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:45:43+00:00,E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index (NQ) Futures Technical Analysis – Wrapping Up Terrible First-Half Performance,"September E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index futures are trading sharply lower shortly before the cash market close on Thursday as investors get ready to wrap up one of the worst first-half performances in history.

Although the technology-based index has been trending lower since November 2021, it’s been really hit hard since the Ukraine-Russia war began on February 24. Compounding the sell-off is soaring inflation, higher interest rates and, more recently, a possible U.S. recession.

At 19:45 GMT, September E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index futures are trading 11536.50, down 154.50 or -1.32%. The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) is at $280.22, down $3.58 or -1.26%.

In economic news, a Commerce Department report showed U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in May. While the report suggested inflation had probably peaked, price pressures are expected to stick around, which means the U.S. Federal Reserve should remain on its aggressive policy-tightening path. Daily September E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index

Short-Term Forecast

Trader reaction to the short-term Fibonacci level at 11524.50 is likely to determine the direction of the September E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index into the close on Thursday.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 11524.50 will indicate the presence of sellers. Consequently, look for the index to eventually retest the last main bottom at 11068.50 if this move creates enough downside momentum.

Taking out 11068.50 will reaffirm the downtrend. This could lead to a quick test of the November 2, 2020 main bottom at 10944.00.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 11524.50 will signal the presence of buyers. This could trigger a quick move into the long-term 50% level at 11671.25.

Overcoming 11671.25 will be a sign of strength. This could trigger a late session short-covering rally into the intermediate retracement zone at 12021.25 to 12246.00. This zone essentially stopped the buying at 12262.00 on June 27.

Side Notes

The short-term direction is likely to be determined by trader reaction to 11671.25 and 11524.25.

Story continues

Aggressive counter-trend buyers are going to try to overcome 11671.25 in an effort to form a potentially bullish secondary higher bottom. Sellers are going to try to drive the index through 11524.25. Their goal is to continue the downtrend.

Welcome to Episode #287 of the Value Investor Podcast.

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

This week, she tries to answer the hardest question in investing: when should you sell a stock?

Warren Buffett has famously said, “Our favorite holding period is forever” and yet he continues to sell positions from his Berkshire equity portfolio.

Buffett has given various reasons for selling over the years but the two most consistent ones are:

1.       He wanted to deploy the money into another investment.

2.       The company wasn’t doing what he thought they’d be doing when he first bought, so he’s getting out.

Selling the Airlines

Perhaps Buffett’s most recent famous stock sale, was his decision to sell all of Berkshire Hathaway’s airline stocks when the pandemic first hit in 2020. In May 2020, Buffett announced they had sold all four of their airline stocks, which had been worth about $4 billion, in April 2020.

At the time, Buffett said, “the world has changed” and didn’t want to own those companies during a pandemic.

Buffett took a lot of heat for getting out so quickly as the airline stocks rallied off their pandemic panic lows.

But looking back now, his decision doesn’t look too silly.

Southwest Airlines During the Pandemic

Take Southwest Airlines LUV, one of Berkshire’s airline stocks. Southwest Airlines rallied on the vaccine news into 2021 but this year it has been a rockier road.

From Mar 28, 2020, which was the pandemic lows, to June 29, 2022, Southwest Airlines was up just 13%. During that same time, the S&P 500 was up 65%.

Story continues

Buffett’s decision to sell Southwest Airlines fit into his “reasons” for selling as the company’s business had changed dramatically with the pandemic.

And now, over 2 years later, it looks like a good decision.

Buffett Sells All the Time

Buffett has sold out of both winning stocks, and losers. He sold out of IBM for a loss in the last decade after the company wasn’t doing what he thought it would.

IBM was a cautionary tale that Buffett doesn’t like to talk about. But he quickly re-entered technology by buying a big stake in Apple. And Apple is now one of Berkshire Hathaway’s big core holdings.

Buffett always has a plan. You should too.

What’s the Plan?

1. Meta Platforms META

Tracey has owned Meta Platforms for 9 years. She originally bought it for Instagram, as she wasn’t a fan of Facebook. Meta Platforms has grown Instagram to over a billion users. It succeeded.

But now Meta Platforms is going in a new direction. It has changed its name and is investing in a new business based on the Metaverse. The company is changing.

For long -term shareholders, is it time to consider selling Meta Platforms?

2. NVIDIA NVDA

NVIDIA has been one of the best performing stocks of the last 20 years. Shares are up 10,674% during that time, and at their peak in Dec 2021, they were up over 22,000%.

It’s been a bad decision to sell NVIDIA during that time.

But NVIDIA is down 47% year-to-date and that could be giving some long-time investors pause.

Should NVIDIA investors be cashing in some profits?

3. Williams-Sonoma WSM

Williams-Sonoma was a big pandemic winner as people rushed out to buy desks and outdoor furniture while stuck at home. It’s West Elm brand couldn’t keep up with demand. And even Williams-Sonoma saw a surge in buying of breadmakers and coffee machines.

Williams-Sonoma is still growing and still has some of the best brands in furniture retail but the economy is now slowing.

Should investors in Williams-Sonoma cash in profit now?

4. RH RH

RH was one of the best performing stocks of the last decade until 2021 when shares started to slide. Over the last year, RH is down 65%.

Tracey has owned shares of RH since 2016, selling only when the pandemic first hit in 2020.

On June 29, RH issued a warning on its Fiscal 2022 guidance due to “the deteriorating macro-economic environment.”

Does RH fit within one of Buffett’s selling parameters?

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:42:00+00:00,Transaction Update: RSI International Systems and ARCpoint Group Announced Terms of Concurrent Private Placement,"Not for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RSI International Systems Inc. (NEX: RSY.H) (the “Company” or “RSI”) and ARCpoint Group LLC (“ARCpoint”) are pleased to announce that further to the Company’s press release issued on April 27, 2022 announcing the terms of the business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) in respect of the proposed reverse takeover of the Company by the members of ARCpoint (the “Proposed RTO”), ARCpoint and its wholly owned subsidiary ARCpoint Finance Corp. (“ARCpoint Finco”) have finalized the terms of the non-brokered private placement (the “Private Placement”) to be conducted concurrently with the Proposed RTO.

Pursuant to the Private Placement, ARCpoint Finco will offer a minimum of 4,777,778 subscription receipts (“Subscription Receipts”) and a maximum of 11,111,111 Subscription Receipts at a price of $0.45 (the “Subscription Price”) per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of a minimum of $2,150,000 and a maximum of $5,000,000.

In connection the Private Placement, ARCpoint Finco will enter into a subscription receipt agreement (the “Subscription Receipt Agreement”) with Odyssey Trust Company (“Odyssey”) to appoint Odyssey as its subscription receipt agent to hold the aggregate subscription proceeds from the Private Placement, less fifty percent (50%) of the cash commission (the “Cash Commission”) payable to eligible finders (the “Finders”) who assist with the Private Placement (such net amount, the “Escrowed Proceeds”, together with all interest and other income earned thereon, the “Escrowed Funds”) in escrow until satisfaction of the following conditions (the “Escrow Release Conditions”):

written confirmation from each of ARCpoint and RSI that all conditions to the completion of the Proposed RTO have been satisfied or waived, other than the release of the Escrowed Funds and the closing of the Proposed RTO, each of which will be completed forthwith upon release of the Escrowed Funds; the Resulting Issuer Shares being conditionally approved for listing on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) and the completion, satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to such listing, other than the release of the Escrowed Funds; and ARCpoint Finco shall have delivered a release notice to Odyssey confirming that items (1) and (2) above have been satisfied (the “Release Notice”).

If Odyssey does not receive the Release Notice prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the date that is one hundred and twenty days (120) days after the closing date of the Private Placement or such later date as may be approved by holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Subscription Receipts (the “Release Deadline”), or if prior to such time, ARCpoint Finco announces to the public that it does not intend to satisfy the Escrow Release Conditions, Odyssey will return to holders of Subscription Receipts, within two (2) business days of the Release Deadline or such earlier date, an amount equal to the aggregate issue price of the Subscription Receipts held by them and their pro rata portion of any interest earned thereon. ARCpoint Finco will be responsible and liable, and will promptly pay, to the holders of Subscription Receipts for any shortfall between the aggregate gross proceeds of the Private Placement (including any applicable interest and income payable or that would have been earned) and the Escrowed Funds.

Upon satisfaction the Escrow Release Condition, each Subscription Receipt issued pursuant to the Private Placement will be automatically exchanged, without payment of any additional consideration and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, for one common share of ARCpoint Finco (a “Finco Share”) and one half (1/2) of a Finco Share purchase Warrant (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”) with each Warrant exercisable to purchase one (1) Finco Share at an exercise price of $0.675 per share for a term of three (3) years from the date of issue.

In connection with the Private Placement, ARCpoint Finco will pay certain finders 6.5% cash commissions (the “Cash Commission”) and 6.5% non-transferable compensation warrants (the “Compensation Warrants”) with each Compensation Warrant exercisable to purchase one (1) Finco Share at a price of $0.45 per share for a period of two (2) years.

Upon closing of the Proposed RTO, the Finco Shares, the Warrants and the Compensation Warrants will be exchanged for Class A Subordinate Voting Shares (“SVS”) and warrants with equivalent terms, respectively, of the resulting issuer of the Proposed RTO (the “Resulting Issuer”).

The net proceeds raised from the Private Placement will be used by ARCpoint for software development, asset acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes.

Amendments of the Business Combination Agreement

The Subscription Price represents a reduced valuation of ARCpoint (the “Updated ARCpoint Valuation”) due to the current market conditions which has led to a change to the proposed consolidation ratio for the common shares of RSI (the “RSI Shares”). Accordingly, the parties to the Proposed RTO have entered into an amending agreement (the “Amending Agreement”) to amend the Business Combination Agreement as follows:

the consolidation ratio (the “Consolidation Ratio”) for the consolidation of RSI Shares immediately prior to the closing of the Proposed RTO has been reduced from 3.1579031 to 2.4930814 pre-Consolidation RSI Shares for one post-consolidation RSI Share (the “Amended Consolidation Ratio”); and the minimum offering sizing of the Private Placement has been reduced from $4,350,000 to $2,150,000;

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:40:07+00:00,"Middleby (MIDD) Acquires Proxaut, Boosts Product Portfolio","The Middleby Corporation MIDD recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Proxaut. The financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps.

Middleby’s shares declined 3% yesterday to eventually close the trading session at $125.4.

Based near Bologna, Italy, Proxaut provides Auto Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to the Industrial processing companies and the food industry. Its two vehicle types facilitate movement of heavy payloads from one point to another and reduces repetitive traditional labor. MIDD generates revenues of about $15 million on an annual basis.

Inside the Headlines

The addition of Proxaut’s strong product line, coupled with its innovative manufacturing processes, is expected to strengthen Middleby’s product offerings in the food processing end market. The buyout will enable Middleby to leverage Proxaut’s expertise in the automated solution space and offer a comprehensive line of AGV solutions to its customers.

This transaction is consistent with Middleby’s policy of acquiring businesses in the automated solution space. The latest acquisition will complement MIDD’s Vemac buyout made in 2018. The latter enhanced MIDD’s offerings of automated solutions.

Zacks Rank, Price Performance and Earnings Estimate Trend

Middleby, with a $6.8-billion market capitalization, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). MIDD is poised to benefit from improving orders across its segments and a robust backlog in the quarters ahead. However, headwinds are expected to continue from the restricted component supply, labor issues and cost inflation. Zacks Investment Research

According to Peterson, ""Operators are able to increase base rents annually and should continue to benefit from the post-pandemic occupancy recovery.""

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with EQIX. Click here to check it out.  EQIX 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of EQIX Peter Lynch Chart of EQIX

In contrast, Chanos, the legendary short seller and founder of Kynikos Associates, argued against data center REITs in a recent interview with the Financial Times. He said, ""The story is that although the cloud is growing, the cloud is their enemy, not their business. Value is accruing to the cloud companies, not the bricks-and-mortar legacy data centers.""

Peterson and Chanos each have valid arguments, so there is also a chance that both could be correct.

An interesting juxtaposition

First, Peterson centers his argument on an income-based approach. REITs are usually income-based investment opportunities as they pay out most of their earnings in dividends to investors.

Based on the data center space, it is likely that most REITs will have strong tenants as it includes tenants that occupy cloud-based businesses. The cloud industry is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 14.9% until 2031. Cloud businesses are considered secular in nature, meaning they will likely be able to pull through a recession by sustaining their earnings. Jeffries Opposes Chanos' Argument, Backs Data Center REITs

Source: Grandview Research.

Chanos' argument evolves around price discovery, which is inextricably linked to the general commercial real estate market. Thus, data center properties will not garner value because of their underlying business activities.

With mortgage rates skyrocketing past 5% and geopolitical risk persisting, we are likely to see broad-based real estate values stagnate for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, real estate prices do not exhibit price momentum as many stocks do, meaning they could see an abrupt drop if a recession comes to fruition.

Two data center REITs to consider

For investors who support Peterson's bull case instead of Chanos' bearish argument, the following REITs might be suitable investment options.

First up is Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), a leading digital infrastructure company focusing on connectivity services. Jeffries Opposes Chanos' Argument, Backs Data Center REITs

Equinix's portfolio comprises nearly 250 data center facilities dispersed across four continents.

This REIT provides a dividend yield of 1.91% and has a price-to-adjusted funds from operations ratio of 23.40.

Another potential opportunity is CyrusOne Inc. (NASDAQ:CONE), which focuses on carrier-neutral data centers and acts as a provider of colocation and peering services. Jeffries Opposes Chanos' Argument, Backs Data Center REITs

The REIT contains approximately 50 data centers globally, with a presence in the U.S., the U.K. and Singapore.

CyrusOne is a price momentum pure-play, trading above its 10-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages.

Concluding thoughts

Chanos and Peterson both have valid viewpoints. I believe data center REITs will sustain their income and dividend payments. Additionally, for the time being, there is inconclusive evidence that the real estate sector will crash.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:35:07+00:00,Fidelity's (FIS) Guaranteed Payments to Aid Merchant Solutions,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS recently announced that it has launched the Guaranteed Payments solution. The integrated solution is expected to provide merchants with higher e-commerce transaction approval rates, thus relieving them from financial liabilities of chargebacks related to fraudulent purchases.

The financial technology provider claims to be the only one offering such a program to merchants. Per FIS, nine of 10 merchants lost revenues in 2021 due to fraud payments. Of the total online payments, fraud accounts for only around 1%, yet merchants have to reject 9% of total orders to avoid frauds. This induces a revenue loss of around $443 billion. The latest solution from the payments processor will likely help merchants increase revenues.

The move from FIS is expected to create a smooth path for increased alignment between preventing frauds and guaranteeing revenues. The program will leverage the data prowess of Worldpay and the Signifyd Commerce Network to deliver higher merchant approval rates and guaranteed chargeback protection. The solution comes at an opportune time when the e-commerce market is witnessing tremendous growth, globally. Fidelity expects the e-commerce market to expand 50% by 2024.

The Guaranteed Payments solution is expected to equip merchants with the ability to decrease false fraud declines through transaction intelligence and machine learning. This will likely help the clients provide better experience and improve customer retention, triggering higher top-line conversion. Such a lucrative product can pull more merchants on FIS’ platform and fortify its footprint in the market.

The new offering will likely lead to increased transaction volumes and improve FIS’ Merchant Solutions segment’s revenues, which took a hit last year from Omicron-led reduction in small- and medium-sized business and travel volumes. The Merchant Solutions unit contributed 32.4% to revenues in 2021.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:35:00+00:00,Former Mastercard EVP and NYC CTO joins Silicon Valley-based startup as Chief Experience Officer and Founding Partner ,"SAN FRANCISCO, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Simplicity Tech Inc., the technology company behind the mobile application that helps cities fight misinformation and strengthen relationships with residents, is proud to welcome Miguel Gamiño Jr. as its Chief Experience Officer and Founding Partner. Miguel previously served as Executive Vice President and Head of Global Cities at Mastercard and brings over 20 years of rich experience working with cities and local governments.

“I can’t think of a better time to accelerate an application like Simplicity to help improve trust and transparency between urban residents and their local government,” said Miguel Gamiño Jr. “This is certain to increase the effectiveness of the critical services delivered by cities daily. The chance to scale this impact in cities across the U.S. and worldwide is an incredible opportunity that I’m thrilled to join.”

While at Mastercard, Miguel’s team developed its ‘City Possible’ program to help cities accomplish inclusive economic growth and prosperity. This became a worldwide network of over 320 cities, states, and other organizations. Simplicity Tech Inc. began its search for a CXO due to the growing interest of large cities in utilizing the Simplicity app following its launch in the U.S. last year. Some of the 30+ cities using the app today include Oakland and the entire San Mateo County, which has nearly half of the Silicon Valley cities.

With the Simplicity app, municipalities and residents can combat the growth of misinformation on social media, improve the speed of information sharing, and reduce the environmental impact of printed materials. The app lets residents choose the type of alerts they want to receive, including updates from various municipal agencies and departments critical to residents’ daily lives, such as the health department, road closures, upcoming events, and emergency notifications. Last year, the company raised over $10 million from institutional investors to fuel its fast growth.

“We developed a unique solution which affects every resident’s daily life in a city,” comments Juraj Gago, co-founder of Simplicity. “With Miguel’s rich experience in the industry, we will be able to help a city of any size to utilize the app to its fullest potential.”

Prior to his role at Mastercard, Miguel served as Chief Technology Officer for the City of New York; before that, he was City Chief Information Officer and Executive Director of the Department of Technology for the City and County of San Francisco, and Chief Information and Innovation Officer for the City of El Paso.

About Simplicity Tech Inc.
Simplicity Tech Inc. is a technology company based in San Francisco Bay Area, with offices in Chicago and Bratislava, Slovakia. Its Simplicity application helps municipalities and residents fight misinformation and stay informed on the most critical updates in their communities.

The  much anticipated NFT rental solution has a stacked integration pipeline  of GameFi, NFT, and blockchain subscription projects.

The  marketplace provides a collateral free rental solution for NFT owners  to rent their NFTs for their utility, ultimately changing the  distribution and valuation metrics for the space as a whole. The team  has already made good headway on integrations with the first titles set  to launch in Q3 and many more AAA games in development viewing the  technology of a core infrastructure supporting their market strategy.

Utilizing  an innovative solution of minting wrapped expriable synthetics, the IQ  Space marketplace does not require collateral to be posted by NFT  renters and poses no risk to ownership of the underlying asset. This  will create a frictionless mechanic to help bring in more players and  users by democratizing NFT utility amongst a larger pool.

The  ability to earn non-inflationary yield from NFT ownership is a key  component missing in the space which will assist in price discovery of  individual assets and projects as well as bolster the value of the asset  class as a whole.

IQ Protocol partners across both the  fungible and non-fungible token solutions include PARSIQ, Mysterium,  Autonio, Radom Network, Sator, ChainMyth, Bitspawn, Solcery, Firework  Games, Nyan Heroes, SPARK ERA, Mogul Productions, Battle Saga,  SolDrinks, TomoChain, Denet, Space SIP, Zone of Avoidance, GEMS, Tiny  Colony, bitsCrunch, Starbots, 3D Gamers Guild, KridaFans, Metastrike,  Solido Games, DarleyGo, Elementies, Guild Saga, PocketPay Finance, Spark  World, Formless, Fabwelt, All Starz, NFTrade, Metopia, Lootbox, Three  Pillars Gaming, Dappio, GameSol, Nekoverse, TudaBirds, MetaMerge,  SolCraft, BloodLoop, Kitsumon, Fellaz, Souls of Meta, Pirates of the  Arrland, GameHub, LuduFi, Penguin Karts, OneRare, Magic Square, Gumball  3000, The Red Village, Moon, and 0x Society.

Speaking about the milestone, IQ Labs CEO Tom Tirman said:

“The  demand for IQ Protocol’s rental solution has been extremely positive  and evidence that this will be a vital component of the crypto  ecosystem.

Teams have been quick to notice the multiple  benefits IQ Protocol brings to projects, players, and asset holders, and  the value that a rental yields bring to a dynamic in-game economy.

We’re  very excited to launch the first games on IQ Space in the coming weeks  and look forward to seeing technology bring new possibilities to the  blockchain gaming experience.”

IQ Space, the IQ Protocol  NFT renting marketplace, will go live on Polygon and BNB in the coming  weeks with Avalanche and Solana releases planned for later in 2022.

ABOUT IQ PROTOCOL

IQ  Space is a blockchain project providing a decentralized money market  for digital asset renting and on-chain subscriptions. The next money  lego that allows users to rent wrapped expirable versions of digital  assets without collateral, while allowing holders to earn by providing  liquidity without risk.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:24:17+00:00,Omicron: Experts want more data to guide US targeting of fall boosters,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants COVID-19 manufacturers to target the latest BA.4/BA.5 coronavirus strain in their boosters for the fall, the agency said Thursday.

The swift decision from the agency, following an advisory panel earlier this week, could give manufacturers a chance to meet the October booster campaign deadline the FDA is targeting. But they will now have to pivot from their focus on the original Omicron (BA.1) strain.

It's why the FDA requested clinical trials be completed by the companies in order to evaluate the booster doses before authorization for use in the fall.

""Vaccine manufacturers have already reported data from clinical trials with modified vaccines containing an Omicron BA.1 component and we have advised them that they should submit these data to the FDA for our evaluation prior to any potential authorization of a modified vaccine containing an omicron BA.4/5 component,"" the FDA's Dr. Peter Marks said in a statement.

""Manufacturers will also be asked to begin clinical trials with modified vaccines containing an omicron BA.4/5 component, as these data will be of use as the pandemic further evolves,"" he added.

The debate

A panel of outside advisers to the FDA voted overwhelmingly to include Omicron-targeting components in boosters expected for the fall on Tuesday.

The vote, 19 yes and 2 no, did not clarify if the boosters should be an Omicron-only vaccine or a bivalent shot — one that includes the original strain of the coronavirus. The vote also did not clarify if the target should be the original Omicron (BA.1) or the new subvariants (BA.4, BA.5) that comprise a majority of cases in the U.S. today.

Kanta Subbarao, chair of the World Health Organization's Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition, told the FDA panel that an Omicron-targeting booster would be necessary, but is not ideal as a primary dose — which makes the original vaccines still relevant for those yet unvaccinated.

Story continues

The vaccine companies presenting that day had different data and vaccine options, but most relied on lab analyses or were still working on collecting data as of the meeting date. They also did not have head-to-head comparisons of BA.1 to BA.4/BA.5.

This concerned some of the experts, who expressed as much at the meeting Tuesday.

Dr. Paul Offit, a voting member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), asked Moderna's president Stephen Hoge if the company had yet done a comparison of the BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine candidate against the original coronavirus, known as ancestral, strain.

""We are still collecting that data,"" Hoge said.

That puts a point on the concern that other experts expressed — that the decision was made prior to having any actual data.

""This is a new product, and I think as a new product it should be handled as a new product...we need a higher standard for protection than what we're being given, I think it's uncomfortably scant,"" Offit said Tuesday.

In addition, the question of whether or not a booster was needed at all was raised. Dr. Cody Meissner, a voting member and chief of the division of pediatric infectious disease at Tufts Children's Hospital, noted that while Omicron variants are more transmissible than previous strains, they haven't been as deadly — and the vaccines will not protect as well against infection as they did before.

Which begs the question of does targeting BA.4/BA.5 make sense in light of the speed at which variants have emerged in the past two years — and what could be relevant by October.

""The question is will the strain mutate so that it's resistant to the immunity that's generated by the vaccine. It's very hard to tell when that will happen,"" Meissner said.

He and others also noted that its possible to reach a point when boosting may not be needed at all, and longer-term memory cell protection in our bodies could play a role.

Dr. Céline Gounder, editor-at-large for public health at Kaiser Health News and an infectious disease specialist, told Yahoo Finance that the current analyses and modeling for the subvariants does not provide any real understanding of what type of protection the vaccines offer.

""We need to better model what fold increase is truly significant,"" she said. ""Once you hit four-to-five fold, that's a more significant increase, and may justify an update in the vaccine. But if it's only a two-fold increase, int he antibody levels, that really doesn't justify (boosters).""

Gounder noted that the debate and uncertainty about the strategy was rooted largely in lack of clinical data.

The timeline pressure

Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during the panel Tuesday that the companies needed as early an indication as possible in order to meet the fall booster timeline.

""For the mRNA vaccines, its probably about a three-month window form when they have some idea of what they are going to manufacture to when they can start to have product. That may not be that they will have the full amount of product for the booster campaign, but they will start to have that product,"" Marks said.

The companies indicated that they could have more product sooner of the BA.1 vaccine as they have already begun to produce, at-risk. But if they were directed to pivot, it would push out the timeline.

Moderna, for example, would be ready by August for a BA.1 rollout, but would need to push to late October, early November for a BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech said it would be ready by early October. Novavax said it would target the fourth quarter, broadly, indicating anywhere between October and December — even as its original vaccine has not yet been authorized for use in adults.

But Moderna's Hoge noted that the timeline was based entirely on manufacturing needs alone — which could be disrupted in light of the clinical trial request.

""Again assuming no clinical data requirements, no data to assess the vaccine at all....and assuming a rapid review cycle,"" Hoge said of having a significant amount of the new vaccine produced.

Eligibility and funding

Even with the debate over what the right strategy should be, the question of who will be eligible for the additional doses is also still on the table. In part due to a battle for funding from Congress, and in part the debate over the benefit of the vaccines.

To that end, the U.S. government committed to purchasing 105 million additional doses — for all ages, which includes 30 microgram, 10 microgram and 3 microgram doses — for the Fall. The government has an option to purchase up to 195 million more doses. The cost is $3.2 billion. In total, to-date, the government has purchased nearly $15 billion worth of doses from Pfizer/BioNTech — or nearly half of the projected vaccine sales of the company

Meanwhile, the U.S. has set aside $5 billion for boosters, taking away from treatment and protective equipment funding, as a $10 billion funding request to Congress has stalled.

That amount of funding available would dictate who could be covered for boosters in the fall.

Given this backdrop of uninspiring performance, let’s delve into the details of the fiscal 2025 financial targets, laid down by the currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) FDX, at the investors’ meeting, held after many years..

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

FedEx, which focuses on rewarding its shareholders through dividends and buybacks, expects to have a dividend payout ratio (adjusted) of at least 25% in fiscal 2025. The ratio of capital expenditures to revenues is expected to be less than or equal to 6.5%. FDX is aiming at an annual total shareholder return of 18-25% through fiscal 2025.

Operating income (adjusted) for fiscal 2025 is anticipated to be $3-$4.5 billion more than fiscal 2022 actuals. The adjusted operating income for the Express, Ground and Freight segments is anticipated in the 8-9%, 11-12% and 20-22% bands, respectively, for fiscal 2025. Compound annual revenue growth through fiscal 2025 is expected in the 4-6% band.Moreover, management at FDX anticipates the CAGR for adjusted earnings per share between 14% and 19% through fiscal 2025.

Despite outlining plans to boost earnings and shareholder returns under the new CEO Raj Subramaniam, who took charge on Jun 1, 2022, FDX witnessed share price depreciation, mainly due to the disappointing guidance for adjusted operating margins of its key ground unit, which handles e-commerce deliveries for many retailers. Adjusted operating margin for the unit is expected in the 11-12% range for fiscal 2025, which does not signal any improvement from the pre-pandemic actuals. The readings were 13.9% and 13% in fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. The sluggish forecast highlights the challenges posed by escalating fuel and other input costs as inflation remains sky-high.

Contrary to Standard 2.05, between May 19, 2022, and May 31, 2022, Crown DK CAN Ltd posted or aired multiple broad gambling inducements that included inducements of boosted 2:1 odds. The promotion was distributed widely via television and social media channels. DraftKings Inc. (DE) is the parent company of Crown DK CAN Ltd.

The Standards were put in place to protect Ontarians. They include clear restrictions on the advertising of inducements, bonuses or credits, except when they are on an operator’s site, or through direct advertising and marketing issued after receiving active player consent (Standard 2.05).

Ontario strictly prohibits broad public advertising of bonuses and other gambling inducements.

A registered operator served with an Order of Monetary Penalty by the AGCO has the right to appeal the Registrar’s action to the Licence Appeal Tribunal (LAT), which is an adjudicative tribunal independent of the AGCO and part of Tribunals Ontario.

QUOTES

“The AGCO will continue to monitor the activities of all registered operators and hold them to high standards of responsible gambling, player protection and game integrity. It is in the public interest that we ensure they are meeting their obligations under Ontario’s Gaming Control Act and the Standards.”

Contrairement à la Norme 2.05, entre le 19 mai 2022 et le 31 mai 2022, Crown DK CAN Ltd. a affiché ou diffusé de multiples incitations au jeu à grande échelle qui comprenaient des incitations à des cotes de 2:1 améliorées. La promotion a été largement distribuée à la télévision et les canaux de médias sociaux. DraftKings Inc. (DE) est la société mère de Crown DK CAN Ltd.

Les normes ont été mises en place pour protéger les Ontariens. Elles comprennent des restrictions claires sur la publicité des incitations, des primes ou des crédits, sauf lorsqu’ils se trouvent sur le site d’un exploitant, ou par le biais d’une publicité et d’un marketing directs émis après avoir reçu le consentement du joueur actif (norme 2.05).

L’Ontario interdit strictement la publicité à grande échelle des primes et autres incitations au jeu.

Un exploitant inscrit qui se voit signifier un avis d’amende par la CAJO a le droit de faire appel de l’action du registrateur auprès du Tribunal d’appel en matière de permis (TAMP), qui est un tribunal juridictionnel indépendant de la CAJO et qui fait partie de Tribunaux décisionnels Ontario.

CITATIONS

« La CAJO continuera à surveiller les activités de tous les exploitants inscrits et à les obliger à respecter des normes élevées en matière de jeu responsable, de protection des joueurs et d’intégrité des jeux. Il est dans l’intérêt du public que nous nous assurions qu’ils respectent leurs obligations en vertu de la Loi de 1992 sur la réglementation des jeux de l’Ontario et des normes. »

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:09:55+00:00,E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Weaker to Close Out the Quarter,"September E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are trading lower late in the session on Thursday as investors closed out an extremely weak first-half of the year. Unfortunately, the downtrend could continue in July as investors are still dealing with the war in Ukraine, high inflation, rising interest rates and the threat of a recession.

At 19:09 GMT, September E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are trading 30717, down 282 or -0.91%. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) is at $307.91, down $2.14 or -0.69%.

In stock related news, Walgreens Boots Alliance said its quarterly sales declined and profits got hit by waning COVID-19 vaccination demand, heavy investments in its health-care business and an opioid settlement with Florida. The stock was down about 7.27% late in the session.

In economic news, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 4.7% in May, the Commerce Department reported. This was lower than the month before. Personal Income met expectations, but personal spending came in below expectations. Daily September E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average

Short-Term Forecast

Trader reaction to the short-term 50% level at 30753 is likely to determine the direction of the September E-mini Dow into the close on Thursday.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 30753 will indicate the presence of sellers. The next downside target is the short-term Fibonacci level at 30490. This is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside with 29639 the next likely target.

Taking out 29639 will reaffirm the downtrend with the February 1, 2021 main bottom at 29027 the next major target.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 30753 will signal the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for the rally to possibly extend into a minor pivot at 31137.

Overtaking 31137 will indicate the buying is getting stronger with the short-term 50% level at 31447 the next target.

SEATTLE, June 30, 2022 /CNW/ -- With pent up demand and the U.S. Independence Day travel rush approaching, premium cruise line Holland America Line is reporting a surge in interest for Alaska, experiencing the highest booking levels for Alaska cruising to the bucket list travel destination during the month of June since before the COVID-19 pandemic.  Alaska cruising growing as more travelers look to explore by ship. Holland America Line operates six ships to Alaska through October with convenient departure gateways of Seattle, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia.

Alaska cruising is growing as travelers look to explore again.

""People are excited to travel again while reconnecting with family and friends in a meaningful way,"" said Beth Bodensteiner, senior vice president and chief commercial officer for Holland America Line. ""We're seeing the pent-up demand leading to increased booking as guests realize cruising is a hassle-free way to enjoy unique destinations such as Alaska.""

As a bucket-list locale for many travelers, Alaska offers close-to-home departures without the need for overseas air, stunning scenery and wildlife, deep history and culture, and areas like Glacier Bay that are best reached from the water.

According to AAA Washington, Seattle, Washington, is the number-one summer domestic destination in the U.S. for Washington travelers -- and the second most popular nationwide -- due in large part to the area's bustling cruise industry. During the upcoming July 4 holiday weekend, AAA Washington travel bookings reveal that the number of people traveling by trains, buses and cruise ships is expected to triple compared to 2021. Holland America Line offers round-trip from Seattle cruises to Alaska on two of its ships.

""Our summer travel inquiries and bookings show people are feeling safe to explore again,"" said Michelle Glass, vice president of travel for AAA Washington. ""Alaska is one of my favorite places to visit in the summer. A preferred partner, like Holland America Line, helps us provide clients with convenient departures to and from our own back yard to this amazing place, without the added cost of airfare.""

Overall, Holland America Line continues to see strong interest in cruises that are a short flight or drive from guests' homes. The cruise line visits 225 different ports in 91 different countries on sailings round-trip from the United States, serving more international destinations on cruises sailing round trip from a U.S. homeport than any other brand. The line's U.S. homeports include Seattle, San Diego, Boston and Fort Lauderdale. Holland America Line also offers more sailings to Alaska from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, than any other cruise line.

""With the cost and recent challenges with air travel, we are seeing excitement and traction from guests within driving distance of our cruise homeports such as Seattle and Vancouver,"" said Kacy Cole, vice president of marketing and e-commerce for Holland America Line. ""We recently invested in local marketing near our homeports and we're already seeing that pay off.""

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:05:28+00:00,What Type Of Shareholders Own The Most Number of Channel Infrastructure NZ Limited (NZSE:CHI) Shares?,"A look at the shareholders of Channel Infrastructure NZ Limited (NZSE:CHI) can tell us which group is most powerful. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

Channel Infrastructure NZ is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of NZ$427m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. In the chart below, we can see that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about Channel Infrastructure NZ.

See our latest analysis for Channel Infrastructure NZ  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Channel Infrastructure NZ?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Channel Infrastructure NZ does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Channel Infrastructure NZ's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth

We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Channel Infrastructure NZ. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Exxon Mobil Corporation with 14% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 13% and 8.5% of the stock.

Story continues

We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track.

Insider Ownership Of Channel Infrastructure NZ

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Channel Infrastructure NZ Limited. It seems the board members have no more than NZ$360k worth of shares in the NZ$427m company. We generally like to see a board more invested. However it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

With a 44% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Channel Infrastructure NZ. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Public Company Ownership

We can see that public companies hold 36% of the Channel Infrastructure NZ shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Channel Infrastructure NZ better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Channel Infrastructure NZ has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.

But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:05:07+00:00,Leading With Inclusion To Leave Dow Better,"By Karen S. Carter, Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Inclusion Officer

Northampton, MA --News Direct-- DOW

With our 125-year anniversary upon us, we spoke with our chief Human Resources Officer and chief Inclusion Officer, Karen S. Carter, to reflect on Dow’s journey and progress in the space of inclusion, diversity and equity (ID&E) and what she expects the next 125 years will bring.

Karen, you have been at Dow for more than 25 years and worked across many divisions and businesses...what inspired you to take on your current role as chief Human Resources Officer and chief Inclusion Officer?

When I was a business leader in the commercial organization, my focus was on helping the Company prosper and thrive, become more innovative and capture market share and new customers. I have the same opportunity in my current role. I am still charged with helping the Company prosper and thrive, helping Dow grow. But now, I have the awesome opportunity to do it through our people and our culture. An inclusive culture, a diverse workforce and an equitable workplace strongly position us to address the most pressing challenges of the world, capitalize on new opportunities and anticipate and overcome the challenges ahead.

I feel an incredible sense of urgency to do my part to leave Dow better….to leave the planet better….to leave society better. Our children and their children will look back on this very moment and talk about what we did or did not do, and the world they live in will determine if we made a positive difference.

As we celebrate our 125-year anniversary, we can't help but wonder how far Dow has come. What are some key highlights in Dow's journey to build a more inclusive culture?

Dow has made progress and I am proud of that. But I also recognize and acknowledge that there is still more progress to be made.

Some people think focusing on inclusion and diversity is new at Dow – but it is not. Inclusion and diversity has been a priority for decades, and I along with many others have been involved in these efforts throughout my entire career. But I think the decision to create an Office of Inclusion and the role of Chief Inclusion Officer in 2017 – a role reporting directly to the CEO – was a turning point. It was less about who was named to the job, but more about the focus, intentionality and elevation of inclusion and diversity as a business imperative that made the difference. It was then that we began taking even more deliberate steps to integrate inclusion into our corporate strategy.

When Jim Fitterling – our Chairman and CEO – defined his ambition for our company in 2018 – which is to become the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive, and sustainable materials science company in the world – inclusion was there, front and center, from the beginning. He said, “Our goal is to build a culture where everyone is respected and valued and has an equal opportunity to develop, advance and be heard.” What employee is not inspired by that statement? And what employee doesn’t hear the message in this ambition that we see them, we hear them, and they belong here?

And there have been many other milestones, including publishing our first Inclusion Report, in 2018 which is now a part of our annual ESG report. This allows us to be transparent about our achievements and the stakes we’ve put in the ground for future progress and gives voice to Dow people around the world who make a difference in creating a more inclusive and diverse Dow.

How is Dow approaching ID&E space today?

In 2021, we updated Dow’s ID&E Strategy which still focuses on leading with inclusion and elevating our focus on diversity, but also importantly includes embedding equity into our practices, policies, and processes. We outlined bold new actions to deliver breakthrough results by 2025, while amplifying transparency and accountability.

I can’t talk about progress at Dow, without talking about our ERGs. They are the catalysts for sustained engagement and driving change inside and outside of Dow. Today, we have 10 ERGs with more than 600 local chapters. About 52% of Dow employees participate around the world. And Dow contractors can also join an ERG and participate in most activities. We have ERGs that cover the dimensions of diversity that most people think about, like ethnic minorities, veterans, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ populations, but we also have ERGs for newer hires and those in the prime of their careers. These groups are safe havens for employees to see themselves, be themselves, and to be heard. ERGs are places where allies engage to learn and advocate for people who may be unlike them. And more and more, ERGs are drivers of business success.

And our CEO has made clear his expectation that all people leaders participate in at least one ERG of their choice – as a personal development opportunity, and to demonstrate to their teams the importance of engagement. Why do we encourage ERG participation so much? Because research and our own data tell us that employees who participate are more engaged. Our annual employee survey data shows that Dow’s ERG participants have 9 percentage points higher satisfaction with the company than non-ERG participants. And higher satisfaction leads to higher engagement.

It’s important to also acknowledge that a lot has changed over the past few years, and expectations have changed for many of our stakeholders including our colleagues, community leaders, investors and more. They expect us to be accountable and transparent. So, at Dow, we are committed to both and have put stakes in the ground that define where we want to be by the year 2025, and we are proactively sharing our progress on annual basis in our ESG report. At the same time, ID&E has been pushed beyond our fence line and into our communities, with greater consideration for issues like social justice. Which is why we have put a social justice council in place to help guide our actions and our advocacy efforts.

What work are you particularly proud of right now as it relates to ERGs across the organization?

Let’s talk about EMERGE, our all-ERG conference. And calling it a conference doesn’t do it justice, I prefer to call it a premier employee experience that’s designed to mobilize ERG participants to advance Dow’s strategic priorities through inclusion, diversity and equity. It empowers them to take action, and to have a stronger voice. People from all roles and job levels – from the CEO to the shop floor – come to EMERGE. It’s interactive. It’s hands on. It’s a tremendous learning and motivational experience. And if that wasn’t enough, we also host a Day of Service, where participants team up to volunteer in the community and demonstrate our strong corporate citizenship.

We are bringing EMERGE back this year for the first time since 2019, and it will be a hybrid event. About 500 Dow colleagues representing 33 countries and all 10 of our ERG groups will be in Houston, Texas. Over 900 Dow colleagues will stream in virtually from around the world and will also engage in activities at their location. This event is the most inspirational time of the year for me and my team. It leaves us energized, fueled with new ideas and geared up to make change. And the return on this investment is what EMERGE participants do after they leave, through the numerous grass-roots actions they initiate at the local level which creates a ripple of change.

As we reflect on Dow’s 125th Anniversary, what’s next for ID&E?

At Dow, our strategy is to Decarbonize and Grow. This will not be easy; it is ambitious, and it is only achievable with a diverse team where everyone can grow and thrive in a workplace that is inclusive and fair for all.

That is why this work is important, and this is what is next for ID&E. Ensuring equity in all that we do is essential to achieving visible and meaningful progress in our culture, in our workforce and in our business results. It is not enough to have an inclusive culture without a diverse workforce. And it is not enough to have a diverse workforce that does not have a fair shot at opportunities.

I look back on our 125 years with great pride for all we’ve been able to achieve. But the ongoing issues of hate, violence, discrimination, and divisiveness serve as stark reminders of the progress we have yet to make, and also serves as fuel for the sense of urgency necessary to achieve more, together.

AAPL,2022-06-30T19:02:30+00:00,"Flight cancellations: How to rebook quickly, according to an expert","As more passengers head to the airport, airlines are struggling to keep up with demand, resulting in a chaotic summer travel season with thousands of delayed or canceled flights.

More than 5,800 flights within, departing from, or arriving in the U.S. were delayed on Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware, and another 600 flights were canceled.

The recent disruptions add to what has been a very rough summer for travelers, with more than 2,800 U.S. flights canceled over Memorial Day weekend and more than 3,000 scratched over the Father’s Day and Juneteenth long weekend.

So what should you do if your flight gets canceled? The Points Guy Founder Brian Kelly shared some tips on how to rebook quickly and secure your refund.

“If you need to get to where you're going immediately, pull out your phone and buy yourself a new ticket,” Kelly advised (video above). “The airline is probably not going to be able to rebook you. If you're going to wait in line for hours to be rebooked, then chances are any of the remaining seats will be snatched up.” People wait in long lines amid summer travel chaos and flight cancellations due to lack of personnel at Dusseldorf International Airport in Dusseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany on June 25, 2022. (Photo by Kadir Ilboga/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)

For reimbursement, Kelly warned it may be best to go through a credit card company because U.S. carriers ""don't owe you anything"" for canceled flights.

American Express Platinum and Chase Sapphire credit cards “have what's called trip delay and cancellation coverage,” Kelly added. “So if you're disrupted, ... go to your credit card company to get reimbursed for hotels and rental cars and all those extra expenses.”

Trip protection has become a popular add-on for travelers amid a tumultuous travel season, but where you obtain that coverage is important, Kelly said.

“If you booked through Expedia and others, they're going to pass you around, and no one's going to take responsibility,” he cautioned. “Always decline their coverage to protect your trip.”

Kelly recommended travel coverage from independent online marketplace InsureMyTrip.com instead. ""You can look at all the different policies, and you're going to get much better coverage at a cheaper price,” he said.

'Be prepared for disruptions'

Mass cancellations and delays are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, and airlines are blaming pilot shortages and understaffed air traffic control as two culprits.

“Going into this busy holiday travel weekend, airlines still don't have their footing,"" Kelly said. “People should be prepared for disruptions, and it's pretty much every airline.”

Despite efforts to improve reliability amid soaring demand, airlines have preemptively trimmed schedules this summer.

Delta cut about 100 flights per day in July while United axed about 50 flights a day from Newark Liberty International Airport starting July 1. Alaska Airlines and JetBlue also announced flight reductions.

Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) projects a busy summer season, with passenger volumes that ""will match and may occasionally exceed those of 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began.""

Last Sunday, TSA screened more than 2.46 million people, the most air travelers in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic. This coming weekend, 3.55 million people are expected to fly ahead of the Fourth of July holiday.

“As long as that demand is high and planes are full, we’re going to continue to see these disruptions,” Kelly said. “The demand just continues to grow, and I don't see that stopping unless a big recession hits the U.S.”

This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

View our latest analysis for Leon's Furniture

The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Leon's Furniture

Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Vice-President of Operations at The Brick Ltd Daniel Leon for CA$1.7m worth of shares, at about CA$16.50 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of CA$16.66. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for Leon's Furniture share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.

Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid CA$4.0m for 241.68k shares. On the other hand they divested 13.65k shares, for CA$335k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Leon's Furniture insiders. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).

Insiders at Leon's Furniture Have Bought Stock Recently

Over the last quarter, Leon's Furniture insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Overall, six insiders shelled out CA$3.8m for shares in the company -- and none sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.

Insider Ownership of Leon's Furniture

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Leon's Furniture insiders own about CA$62m worth of shares. That equates to 5.5% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Leon's Furniture Insiders?

It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Leon's Furniture we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) Securities Class Action:

The litigation focuses on Wells Fargo’s statements about its diverse slate hiring policy (“Diverse Search Requirement”), which required that at least half of interview candidates must represent a historically underrepresented group for most posted jobs in the U.S. paying more than $100,000 per year.

Specifically, the complaint alleges Defendants: (1) misrepresented its commitment to diversity in its workplace; (2) conducted fake job interviews to meet its Diverse Search Requirement; and, (3) as a result, was under increased risk of regulatory and/or governmental scrutiny.

On May 19, 2022, the New York Times reported that a former executive in the company’s wealth management division (Joe Bruno) told it that often diverse candidates would be interviewed for jobs already promised to someone else and he was fired after he reported to his superiors that the practice of conducting “‘fake interviews’” was “‘inappropriate, morally wrong, ethically wrong.’” NYT also cited other current and former Wells Fargo employees further corroborating Mr. Bruno’s account.

Then, on June 9, 2022, the NYT reported that federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into whether Wells Fargo violated federal laws by conducting sham interviews of minority and female job candidates.

These disclosures caused Wells Fargo’s shares to decline sharply.

“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving Wells Fargo mispresented its commitment to diversity,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

The deal adds 47 locations to Rarebreed's 71-practice community, making it one of the largest practice groups in the country.

The company will be headquartered in Portland, Maine, and is majority backed by Revelstoke Capital Partners. The combined company is one of the most well-capitalized veterinary health platforms in the U.S., positioned for rapid future expansion through acquisition and building veterinary hospitals.

Sean Miller, COO, commented, ""The acquisition of VBF represents a major milestone for Rarebreed and the veterinary community. Our goal has always been to reimagine the veterinary experience by creating a working environment where team members feel supported, valued, heard — and happy to come to work every day. As we strengthen our community, in a measured and thoughtful way, the closer we are to reaching that goal.""

VBF CEO Jeff Wilson added, ""I am very excited to begin our relationship with Rarebreed. Vet's Best Friend and Rarebreed are similar mission-based organizations that are highly focused on our people. By joining together, we will be able to accelerate our mission throughout the veterinary industry.""

Rarebreed and VBF share a common purpose: to take care of the people who take care of pets. We believe that when you take care of your team, excellent patient care will follow. Both companies reject the one-size-fits-all partnership model, instead working with hospital owners to create a relationship that works for them. The combined company, which includes general practice, urgent care, and specialty emergency hospitals, will work to create a broad network that values healthcare teams and offers the innovation and cutting-edge technology necessary to expand, improve, and optimize service.

""We are thrilled to welcome the VBF team to Rarebreed,"" said Dan Espinal, CEO. ""Their vision to take care of the people who take care of our pets mirrors our own. Together we will be able to positively impact the lives of more veterinary team members from Florida to the northeast corner of Maine. I look forward to working together to improve medical outcomes, bettering the lives of veterinary healthcare teams.""

BOSTON, June 30 (Reuters) - Aerojet Rocketdyne shareholders on Thursday elected the eight-person board slate headed by Chief Executive Officer Eileen Drake, the company said in a statement, ending one of the most bitterly fought proxy contests of the year.

Based on preliminary results, Drake's slate won more than 75% of the votes cast, with Drake herself winning more than 83% of the vote, the statement said. The eight-person slate nominated by Executive Chairman Warren Lichtenstein received roughly 25% of the vote.

The meeting was held earlier this morning and lasted only minutes, said people familiar with the event.

Drake and Lichtenstein, whose Steel Partners and affiliates own more than 5% of the U.S. rocket maker's stock, have been battling each other since the collapse of a planned $4.4 billion merger with Lockheed Martin Corp earlier this year.

""A difficult and costly fight has brought us to this point, but the time has come today to plot a positive path and work with all our shareholders, including Steel Partners, to maximize value,"" Drake said in a statement. She also thanked Lichtenstein and other departing board members for their service.

CHICAGO, June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ComEd today joined the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) to encourage job seekers to enroll in the next class of the Overhead Electrical Line Worker (OELW) training program. The OELW program at Dawson Technical Institute of Kennedy-King College helps prepare job seekers for entry-level craft roles in the electrical industry. The upcoming OELW session will run from September 12, 2022 through March 30, 2023 at the Dawson Technical Institute, located at 3901 S. State Street in Chicago.

""ComEd’s ability to provide access to clean, affordable and reliable power for 9 million people throughout the region depends on a highly skilled workforce – and the Dawson OELW program is key to attracting diverse, local talent needed to power our communities,"" said Diana Sharpe, head of workforce development at ComEd. ""The Dawson OELW program has helped hundreds of students prepare for exciting careers in our industry. We encourage more residents to apply to learn a skilled trade and to help guide the clean energy transition.""

Participation in the OELW program can provide job seekers a competitive edge in applying for employment at ComEd, including jobs such as line workers, which offer starting hourly wages of nearly $29, as well as employee benefits such as 401k and family wellness programs. ComEd has recently announced its plans to hire an additional 500 entry-level workers over the next three years to help meet the demands of the clean energy transition.

ComEd and CCC are committed to removing barriers to job training and access to employment opportunities. To that end, ComEd has committed $50,000 in scholarships for 10 Chicago residents to pursue the Dawson OELW program. Additionally, interested applicants may be eligible to enroll in the OELW program at no cost through City Colleges’ Future Ready program, which provides students access to high-demand, short-term programs at no cost. To learn more about Future Ready, go to www.ccc.edu/futureready.

""We are thrilled that ComEd shares our mission and is helping Chicagoans meet their career objectives with these generous scholarships,"" said Juan Salgado, Chancellor of City Colleges of Chicago. ""Together with ComEd, we are supporting our students to pursue their life goals in a pathway that leads to in-demand and well-paying careers with an upward trajectory in the exciting field of energy.""

ComEd and CCC launched the OELW training program at Dawson Tech in 2006 to help expand access to specialized training needed to support job seekers pursuing roles in the electrical and utility trades. During the program, participants learn a combination of math and physical skills needed to succeed in the electrical industry. Participants receive field training as well as classroom preparation needed for the construction and skilled trades (CAST test) and fundamentals of electricity to perform work safely. Upon completion, students receive an Advanced Certificate from CCC, and job placement support.

Since the program launched, more than 435 participants have graduated, with the program helping residents acquire skills needed in math and physical training to advance in utilities industries. More than 60 percent of OELW graduates have been hired by ComEd.

CCC is accepting applications for the Fall OELW program now. There are some pre-requisites including scheduling a one-hour orientation with a CCC advisor, taking an English and math placement exam, and completing a pole climbing evaluation at Dawson Tech.

This summer, ComEd will host a series of climb clinics and interviewing workshops to help applicants overcome barriers to training and employment. Additionally, applicants can take an online practice CAST test, an industry entrance exam that tests math and reading skills.

To learn more about pre-qualifications and to submit an application, please visit: City Colleges of Chicago - Kennedy-King - Dawson Technical Institute (DTI) of Kennedy-King College (ccc.edu) or apply today, visit www.ccc.edu/apply.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:56:49+00:00,How to protect your data in a post Roe v Wade world,"The fall of Roe v. Wade is raising serious concerns about whether women’s’ online data could be used to prosecute them in states where abortions will soon be, or are now, illegal.

The thinking is that the digital footprints women leave behind while discussing or searching for information about abortions or clinics could be scooped up by law enforcement in anti-abortion states and used as evidence in cases against them.

It’s not unheard of for authorities to use women’s’ online data, including abortion-related search history, to prosecute cases. And with the possibility that anti-abortion states could attempt to prosecute women who have abortions, protecting your online data has taken on increased urgency.

While this list isn’t exhaustive in the ways it can help you protect your data, it’s a means to get started if you find yourself in need of doing so.

Getting rid of your data

Many women have been deleting period tracking apps for fear that the information they gather could be used against them in the future. But this is a dangerous move in two ways. The first is, deleting the app doesn’t get rid of the data a company already has on you, and it’s not just period tracking apps that collect tons of information.

Before deleting your account in any app, whether it’s a period tracking or even a social media app, you’ll first want to request that a company deletes your data on their end. This ensures that it doesn’t have any information about you to turn over to authorities.

You should only delete the app itself after you submit a request for the company to delete your data.

Use a privacy-focused web browser

Chrome is the world’s most popular web browser with a global market share of nearly 65%, according to Statcounter. But Chrome isn’t exactly the most private browser. After all, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) makes the vast majority of its revenue from ad sales, and the more data it can collect on its users, the better it can target them with ads.

Story continues

To help sweep away the breadcrumbs left behind while you browse the web, you can download and use private browsers instead. Brave browser is a highly-rated web browser that eliminates user data like cookies and blocks third-party trackers. And because Brave is based on Google’s Chromium open-source software, but largely stripped of its tracking capabilities, you’ll still be able to access the vast majority of Chrome compatible websites. The Brave browser is a privacy-centric web browser. (Image: Brave Software)

Changing your browser alone, though, doesn’t matter if you’re also using a search engine that tracks your usage like Google. To better protect yourself and your anonymity, you can try DuckDuckGo, a privacy-centric search engine that promotes itself as a means to prevent third parties from collecting your user data.

Use VPNs to obscure your location

VPNs, or virtual private networks, essentially create a tunnel through the web that allow you to connect to the same websites you normally do, but without giving up your own internet protocol, or IP, address. Think of an IP address as your device’s mailing address. It tells websites where you’re physically located, which can be used to provide you with things like hyper local search results at the expense of also recognizing where you’re browsing from.

A VPN, however, spoofs your actual location data, meaning that if you’re, say, located in Texas or another anti-abortion state and want to look up information about getting an abortion in New Jersey where it’s legal, you could make it appear as though you’re actually browsing from Jersey rather than Texas.

This can also help obscure your identity online, especially when paired with a privacy-centric browser and privacy forward search engine.

Understand what information apps gather

The apps you use on a daily basis also collect massive amounts of data about you. It’s not only the data you dump into those apps, such as photos, status updates, or birth dates, either. Apps can also collect data about your browsing habits in other apps and websites.

That’s why it’s important to understand exactly what kind of data apps and websites gather about you. In a perfect world, you’d be able to do this quickly for every app and website you use. But that’s just not tenable given the numerous apps and sites most people use on a daily basis. Apple's App Tracking Transparency can block apps from tracking your information across the web. (Image: Apple)

Instead, you can focus on the apps that you would use to discuss or look into abortions. Apple (AAPL) has a feature called App Transparency Tracking (ATT), which can provide you with a detailed look at the kind of information that apps collect about you. You can also select whether apps can access certain features on your smartphone including GPS data. Google is working on a similar tool.

It’s also important to read apps’ privacy policies to determine whether or not they share your data with third parties and find out their stances on working with governments. Some companies try to limit the amount of information they turn over to authorities when requested to do so via a subpoena, while others will not. Looking into their privacy policies will give you a better understanding of just how safe your data is while using certain apps.

Use encrypted communications tools

Online communications, whether that’s emails or text messages, could also be used against women in court cases related to abortion. To prevent that, it’s best to use services that offer end-to-end encryption.

End-to-end encryption scrambles your data using a special key from the moment it leaves your phone or device to the moment it gets to the person you’re messaging. Only the person you’ve sent it to can decrypt the message, so third parties can’t capture your data.

Apps like WhatsApp and Signal offer end-to-end encryption, meaning no one, not even their parent companies can gain access to your conversations. That means even if the government tried to subpoena your data, Meta, WhatsApps’ parent company, and Signal can’t turn anything over.

Email services like Proton Mail also provide also offer end-to-end encryption features. When emailing another Proton Mail user, messages are automatically end-to-end encrypted, and when emailing, say, a Gmail user, you can set up a password so the user can decrypt your messages.

The analyst maintained an Outperform rating. The company announced a revised outlook for 2022, noting that demand trends have fallen due to macro headwinds such as rising interest rates and declining luxury home sales. The analyst noted the outlook is disappointing, and the stock is likely to trade sideways in the near term with the housing market cooling off and the stock market under pressure. However, the analyst believes that RH remains a strong brand and is transforming into an international luxury lifestyle player from a U.S. home furnishing retailer.

Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.

In a recent episode, I featured a gentleman who has designed what I believe is the ultimate personal finance software. It's better than anything I've ever seen.

That episode which came out on May 12 was titled Get Your Money Game In Top Shape With Mark Harvey, The MoneyPlan Coach.

What I loved about Mark Harvey's approach was the comprehensive nature of the platform for all areas of your financial life. And all the calculations were well connected so you could create scenarios for anything you wanted to see.

Mark is also big on getting the message to people when they are young and impressionable -- but also flexible in their habits -- with financial education and tools like this.

Be sure to catch that episode if you haven't yet because it's packed with good perspective from a guy who was cutting his teeth in the mortgage market over 30 years ago and he's now an RIA and has the highest fiduciary role with the IRS to serve his clients, that of the Enrolled Agent.

Meet the College Investor

As I was helping Mark look for other podcasts to visit and spread the word, I came across another gem of a teacher, Robert Farrington of The College Investor. The website is a dynamic hub of information, resources, methodologies, and platform, institution, and technology reviews for new investors. Here's the quick overview...

The College Investor is on a mission to help you escape student loan debt so that you can start building real wealth for the future.

They help you navigate your personal finance decisions - so you can escape debt, earn more money, learn how to start investing, and more.

The College Investor has been providing expert guides, reviews, tutorials, and more for their readers since September 2009. What started out as a personal finance blog by founder Robert Farrington has evolved into a financial media brand reaching millions of readers per month - across their website, podcast, and video channels.

In the podcast, I talk with the very enthusiastic founder Robert Farrington, America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America's Student Loan Debt Expert.™

After talking a little about Robert's early experiences with money, debt, and investing, I dive right into asking him about three benchmark articles for his wide audience, including the up-and-coming Gen Z...

How To Get Started Investing In College
How To Get Started Investing In Your 20s
How To Get Started Investing In Your 30s

What impresses me about Robert's approach to early investing education is that it basically ""flips the script"" for a college grad from ""saddled with debt"" to a mentality of ""proactively crushing debt and building lifetime wealth.""

That headstart at 20 vs 30 is powerful!

And what I also love about getting to high school and college kids is that if you can teach them to budget for saving and investing, you've taught them one of the most powerful skill-habits that will serve them tremendously in their prime earning and spending years.

One question I forgot to ask Robert was this: I've started to see a mini-revolt online (YouTube influencers) toward the 401k as if it is some type of giant scam. If you as a reader or listener have a view here, please share in the comments, or when you share the podcast and article on social media.

The $100 Billion Cult Doubles

In 2018, I talked about ""The $100 Billion Cult: Video Gaming and Youth Culture"" and now that market is going to cross $200 billion this year. Microsoft thinks it's such a big part of what I call the ""ET Squared Economy"" (Exponential Technology X Experience + Transformation) that they were willing to bet $68.7 billion to swallow up Activision Blizzard.

Millennials and Gen Z are working, earning, creating, and spending in this new ET Squared Economy that allows them to individually build wealth as they partake in massive global wealth generation.

Last week, my guest was Zechariah Schaefer of the Advice-Only firm Ascent Personal Finance where he focuses on helping Gen Z and Millennial investors with financial planning. Catch that episode for more insight on what drives the youth fascination for games, tech, crypto, and the new rules of a new economy.

And if I had to recommend five stocks for those 45 and under right now, I'd go with NVIDIA NVDA, Apple, Shopify SHOP, Block, and CrowdStrike CRWD. Maybe I'd throw in MongoDB too as a robust and innovative database technology platform that offers a new ecosystem outside Google and AWS for developers.

Why NVIDIA? The #1 provider of advanced technology for machine learning/AI, gaming/creating, medical diagnostics, and automation/robotics capabilities.

Why Apple AAPL? The juggernaut will continue to dominate in devices and software, even for what comes next in augmented reality (AR) after the iPhone.

Why Shopify? As Robert Farrington recommends, all young investors should be building multiple streams of income, and Shopify will be a magnet for learning the ropes of e-commerce.

Why Block SQ? The premier ecosystem for small business is dedicated to serving all kinds of independent creators and staying in tune with the Blockchain economy.

Why CrowdStrike? A top cybersecurity platform specializing in endpoint threats at the edge of the cloud. This is vital in a world of IoT, 100 billiion connected devices, and remote work.

College Investor Audio Show

Finally, I want to highlight the genius of Robert Farrington with his alternative podcast mode. Instead of long, rambling interviews (I feel seen), he publishes short episodes of the College Investor Audio Show every week that highlight new research, reviews, or recap an existing article.

Sounds like I could learn a few things from Robert and his team.

Be sure to listen to our ""shorter"" chat and get the goods from a mission-driven investor who's been working over a decade to help Millennials (and now their kids) sketch their roadmap and get the vehicles for a life of wealth building.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:52:00+00:00,"In NCLA Amicus Win, SCOTUS Limits EPA’s Regulatory Authority Under Clean Air Act","Washington, D.C., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a blockbuster 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) sweeping claim of regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The Court stated that EPA could not satisfy the “major questions” doctrine nor “point to ‘clear congressional authorization’” to devise carbon emissions limits. The New Civil Liberties Alliance, a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group, filed an amicus brief in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, supporting the Petitioner States’ challenge against EPA.

EPA argued that its statutory authority should be read broadly, and that the CAA grants the agency a license to order the wholesale restructuring of the power industry in order to address climate-change concerns. But the Court held that any such major restructuring implicates the “major questions” doctrine—under which Congress is presumed not to have authorized major regulatory activity unless it has issued a clear statement to that effect. The Court noted that the CAA includes no such clear statement.

Writing for the six-justice majority, Chief Justice Roberts said, “it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme in Section 111(d). A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.” In his concurrence, Justice Gorsuch wrote that the Court applies the “major questions” doctrine when interpreting federal statutes, in part because doing so ensures that all legislative power is exercised by Congress, not by unaccountable federal bureaucrats—who are not authorized by the Constitution to exercise Congress’s legislative power. Gorsuch’s concurrence cites NCLA founder and CEO Philip Hamburger’s work three times.

NCLA’s amicus brief argued that the essence of the American Republic is that the people are bound only by laws enacted by their representatives. The “major questions” doctrine, a canon of statutory interpretation that secures this fundamental freedom holds that Congress must make major national policy decisions, not by administrative agencies. The Court correctly held that decarbonization of the energy industry is a major policy decision that Congress has not expressly made.

NCLA commends the Court for its decision but is concerned that the major questions doctrine’s reasoning might be misused by lower courts to decide that Congress may divest its legislative power if it does so knowingly and expressly. The majority opinion contains no such suggestion, but neither does it expressly disavow Congress’s authority to divest legislative power. When enacting the Constitution, the people gave to Congress, and Congress alone, the power to legislate, most centrally the power to make binding rules—those limiting their liberty. The major questions doctrine is a clear-statement principle to enforce the over-arching constitutional principle that Congress should not readily be interpreted to have delegated its legislative power. But when Congress does act knowingly and expressly, the doctrine must not in any way be deemed to authorize divesting massive legislative power.

NCLA released the following statements:

“The court reached the right outcome, but on strange reasoning. It seems to be saying: If Congress is going to violate the Constitution (by divesting massive legislative power), it must do so knowingly and clearly. As if that somehow would be a cure!” 
— Philip Hamburger, Chief Executive Officer, NCLA

“The Court agreed with NCLA that Congress did not grant EPA authority to restructure the entire power industry. And we are gratified that Justice Gorsuch’s concurring opinion emphasized a point on which NCLA’s amicus brief focused: if Congress through the Clean Air Act really had granted EPA the unbounded authority to regulate energy production it was asserting, the legislation would have violated the Constitution’s mandate that all legislative power must be exercised by Congress.”
— Rich Samp, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“At heart, this decision is a victory for democracy: the major decisions affecting people’s lives are to be made by the people’s representatives in Congress, not by unelected bureaucrats. Just in time for the anniversary of our nation’s freedom, the Court has gifted the American people a renewal of their democracy.”
— Brian Rosner, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

Walnut Street in downtown Springfield, MO, within walking distance to Missouri State University.

Built in 2019 by Cornerstone Development out of St. Louis, MO, the property has an excellent unit mix of one, two, three and four bedroom units, all with bed/bath parity. Tenant amenities include a pet spa, swimming pool, fitness center, business center, and game room, among others. Units are offered with luxury finishes, balconies or patios, and in-unit laundry.

Sean Lyons, founding partner of Triad, stated: “Teaming up with RRA/GREA on this transaction proved to be a very successful strategic approach to expose this asset to a very wide and diverse buyer pool. This resulted in a competitive bidding process that provided the seller with multiple options in our final selection process.”

Missouri State University has an enrollment of over 24,000 students and has seen a 5% increase in enrollments since 2015. Douglas Sitt, Co-Head of Student Housing at RRA/GREA stated: “The student housing market at Missouri State University is well positioned to perform extremely well, as there are no purpose built student housing projects in the development pipeline, while pre-leasing velocity and growth is significantly outpacing last years leasing activity.”

“We were able to execute on the sale during a challenging debt market environment. Working with Triad, a great Midwest broker team, and utilizing the RRA/GREA platform brought in buyers from all over the country. We ended up closing with a market leader in the student housing industry,” added Ken Wellar, Managing Partner at RRA/GREA.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:48:48+00:00,U.S. gives NFG more time to build PA-NY Northern Access natgas project,"June 30 (Reuters) - National Fuel Gas Co (NFG) on Wednesday got more time from federal regulators to build the U.S. energy company's proposed Northern Access natural gas pipeline project in Pennsylvania and New York.

The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved NFG's January 2022 request for a 35-month extension to build the project by December 2024.

Northern Access is one of several fossil fuel projects held up by regulators in New York over the past several years. Others include Williams Cos Inc's Northeast Supply Enhancement and Constitution gas pipelines.

FERC approved the project in February 2017 and said NFG had to put it in service by February 2019.

NFG, however, did not build the project because it could not get a water quality certificate from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).

In November 2018, NFG asked FERC for more time to complete construction due to the delay in getting the water quality certificate. In January 2019, FERC gave NFG until February 2022 to finish the project.

In October 2020, NFG asked FERC for another extension until December 2024 to complete the project, but FERC dismissed that request as premature.

NFG made the current request for more time to finish the project in January 2022 after a court determined the NYSDEC waived its water quality certification authority by waiting too long to act on the company's request.

Northern Access, which includes a 99-mile (159-km) pipeline, is designed to deliver about 0.49 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania to New York.

In the past, NFG projected the project would cost about $500 million. Officials at the company were not immediately available for comment.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:47:54+00:00,Why Cruise Line Stocks Plunged Again Today,"Not only is the broader market's decline dragging down their share prices, but there are also fears that the companies are seeing pricing pressure for tickets. Carnival (NYSE: CCL) fell by as much as 8.7% in early trading, while Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL) dipped as much as 8.4%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH) dropped 9.2%. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Jamie Rollo said in a report that he was worried that cruise line companies could ultimately face insolvency if their business conditions don't improve soon.",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/85e30170-2468-3b4f-9ad2-b0c08b5e872d/why-cruise-line-stocks.html,"['CCL.LSE', 'CCL.US', 'CUK.US', 'CUKPF.US', 'CVC1.F', 'NCLH.US', 'POH1.F', 'POH3.F', 'RCL.US']"
AAPL,2022-06-30T18:47:17+00:00,Costco Stock Could Extend Rebound Into July,"Though it's seen a sharp pullback from its early April record highs near the $610 region, retail concern Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has held fast to a nearly 21% year-over-year lead -- quite impressive considering the tumble the broader market has taken this quarter. More recently, COST staged a bounce off the $406 mark, and quickly broke past pressure at the 30-day moving average, which now sits just below as potential support. And while the $490 area now looms as potential resistance, there's reason to believe Costco stock could be a noted outperformer in July, and potentially break north of here by the end of the month. cost june 30

This is because the equity just landed on Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's list of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 in July going back 10 years. According to this data, COST has staged positive returns during the month 90% of the time, averaging a gain of 4.6%. A similar move from its current perch would put the security right near the $503 level, which hasn't been touched since mid-May. What's more, Costco stock is just one of two retailers to show up on the list, next to Target (TGT), which has averaged a 4.6% monthly return.

Despite the relative outperformance, several analysts analysts remain hesitant , and this could leave the door wide open for more bull notes. Of the 18 in coverage, five consider the stock a ""hold.""

An unwinding of pessimism among options traders could also put wind at the stock's back. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the stock sports a 10-day put/call volume ratio of 1.11, which sits higher than 84% of readings from the past year. In other words, puts are getting picked up at a quicker-than-usual clip.

Short-term options traders have also been unusually put-biased. This is per COST's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.32, which stands in the 76th percentile of its 12-month range.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-stock-could-extend-rebound-184717955.html,"['COST.MX', 'COST.US', 'COWC34.SA', 'CTO.F']"

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:35:33+00:00,GM calls off plan to sell India car plant to China's Great Wall,"By Aditi Shah

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - General Motors (GM) said on Friday it had called off the sale of a shuttered Indian plant to China's Great Wall Motor after they failed to obtain regulatory approvals, amid a tougher stance by New Delhi towards investments from Beijing.

GM struck a deal in January 2020 to sell the plant to Great Wall, with the Chinese SUV-maker expected to pay up to $300 million as part of a broader plan to invest $1 billion to establish a presence in India's growing car market.

The agreement, which was extended twice, expired on June 30.

""We have been unable to obtain the required approvals within the time frame of the deal,"" George Svigos, executive director, communications, GM International, told Reuters.

""Our strategy in India remains unchanged and we will now explore further options for the sale of the site,"" he said, adding the company ""hopes to achieve a price that reflects the value of the asset"".

Great Wall and the Indian government did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

GM's deal with Great Wall was agreed just months before India toughened its stance in April 2020 on investment from neighbouring countries including China, making them the first major casualty of the move that has held up billions of dollars of capital inflow in sectors such as automobiles and technology.

This was part of a broader crackdown by India on businesses with Chinese links amid worsening diplomatic relations. Separately, New Delhi also banned more than 300 Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok, over security concerns.

The move draws a line under a more than two-year effort by GM and Great Wall, forcing the U.S. firm to restart its hunt for a buyer while it continues to spend money on maintaining some machinery and tooling in the factory.

Asked if the plant could be used to make electric vehicles, Svigos said it was suitable for a number of industrial uses, including by non-automotive companies, and GM would explore all options.

Story continues

GM, which stopped selling cars in India at the end of 2017, has already sold its other plant to SAIC Motor Corp, where the Chinese automaker builds cars under its British brand, MG Motor.

This will also send Great Wall back to the drawing board on its plans to enter India, which it considered an important part of its global strategy to break into new markets like Latin America, Thailand and Brazil.

Last year, Great Wall re-allocated to Brazil a portion of its $1-billion investment earmarked for India and reassigned some of its staff after delays in winning government approvals.

NEW DELHI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -General Motors (GM) said on Friday it had called off the sale of a shuttered Indian plant to China's Great Wall Motor after they failed to obtain regulatory approvals, amid a tougher stance by New Delhi towards investments from Beijing.

GM struck a deal in January 2020 to sell the plant to Great Wall, with the Chinese SUV-maker expected to pay up to $300 million as part of a broader plan to invest $1 billion to establish a presence in India's growing car market.

""Great Wall Motor will keep its attention to the Indian market in the future and continue looking for new opportunities,"" the Chinese automaker said in a statement on Friday, while confirming the termination of the plant deal.

The Indian government did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:35:08+00:00,This Analyst Thinks Blueprint Medicines' Non-Dilutive Funding 'Deflates M&amp;A Speculation',"Today Blueprint Medicines Corp (NASDAQ: BPMC) announced strategic financing agreements with Sixth Street and Royalty Pharma Plc (NASDAQ: RPRX) for up to $1.25 billion, including $575 million upfront upon deal closure. SVB Securities thinks the terms of the deals are fairly valued on the Sixth Street portion and favorable for Blueprint Medicines on the Royalty Pharma portion. ""In addition, these deals provide non-dilutive capital and independent validation by sophisticated investors, although we think this is largely counterbalanced by what may be perceived as deflating the likelihood of near-term strategic optionality for the company,"" the analyst writes. As per the analysis, the Sixth Street Ayvakit deal is relatively neutral at first glance, but additional debt could make the deal less attractive. For Royalty Pharma, SVB believes the transaction appears favorable for Blueprint Medicines. ""We think most investors did not view BPMC as having a short cash runway or needing financing...Therefore, we think that the impact on near-term strategic optionality, at a time when several acquisitions have been announced, and the bid/asks appear to be aligning, may disappoint some investors hoping for a larger transaction,"" the analyst notes. Price Action: BPMC shares are down 0.90% at $51.74 during the market session on the last check Thursday.

The good news: Ready, who was Google's President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users and before that served as PayPal's COO, both appears to be a capable exec and has a background that should serve Pinterest well as it tries to flesh out its e-commerce/payments features to help grow its top line. In some ways, Pinterest is a product-discovery platform as much as it is a social network, and with its average revenue per user (ARPU) standing at just $4.98 in North America and $1.33 globally in Q1, there still appears to be a lot of headroom to improve monetization.",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/72ebc9ce-df09-35fe-8d87-1cc5c51be171/is-pinterest%27s-ceo-change.html,"['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'PINS.US', 'QCI.F', 'QCI.XETRA', 'QCOM.MX', 'QCOM.US']"

SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Health Net, one of California's longest serving and most experienced Medi-Cal partners, has been recognized by the Institute for Medicaid Innovation (IMI) for their various initiatives throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to address social determinants of health and to reduce inequities. Health Net Colored Logo (PREFERRED) (PRNewsfoto/Health Net)

""The pandemic meant we needed to rapidly pivot how we do our work to continue meeting the needs of our members,"" said Dr. Pooja Mittal, Chief Health Equity Officer at Health Net. ""We are proud of the work our teams have done to help members stay connected to care and services, whether through telehealth or community outreach. We will continue these efforts for years to come.""

When the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, many providers halted outpatient care for days, weeks or longer to decrease the risk of transmitting the virus to patients or health care workers. But Californians continued to need food, information and support. Health Net stepped in and listened, adapting existing initiatives and developing new ones to meet the health and social needs of the communities they serve.

IMI hosted a webinar to examine and highlight initiatives that addressed social determinants of health and health inequities exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, Health Net had four programs that were showcased to attendees, including their COVID-19 Telehealth Capacity Support, MLKCH Street Medicine Program, Family Hui Initiative and Los Angeles Food Bank Pilot.

COVID-19 Telehealth Capacity Support
As medical appointments quickly shifted to virtual visits during the pandemic, Health Net launched its COVID-19 Telehealth Capacity Support program to establish and expand telehealth services for Medi-Cal enrollees. In 2020, Health Net awarded 138 Telehealth Capacity grants, totaling $13.4 million, to Medi-Cal providers across California. Grantees identified the following benefits of providing telehealth services:

Story continues

31% said funding allowed them to conduct routine checkups and wellness visits. 42% indicated that telehealth was an important tool for patient screenings. 17% provided health education, including nutrition, physical activity counseling, and smoking-cessation programs. 16% reported success in providing mental health services.

MLKCH Street Medicine Program The effects of the pandemic have been particularly difficult for individuals who are experiencing homelessness. That's why Health Net funded the MLKCH Street Medicine program, a collaboration between Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital (MLKCH) and University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. The program engages experts in street medicine to help reduce disparities in health outcomes for people experiencing homelessness in South Los Angeles by achieving the following outcomes:

Increased connection to primary and specialty medical care; Increased access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment; Improved sanitation and nutrition; Decreased avoidable hospital and emergency department visits; Reduced disparities in hypertension and diabetes control.

Family Hui Initiative Recognizing the challenges of parenting throughout the pandemic, Health Net funded the community-based organization, Lead4Tomorrow, to provide Family Hui parental, peer-led support groups in Imperial, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Bernardino and San Joaquin counties. Named for the Hawaiian term ""Hui"" (hoo'ee), a cooperative group working together for a shared purpose, Family Hui aims to promote healthy child development. The program supports and empowers parents and caregivers in the joys of raising their children and addresses the challenges in healthy ways through providing:

A trauma-informed parenting curriculum; Leadership training for peer facilitators; Resilience-building activities; Connections for parents to services to build a strong support community.

Los Angeles Food Bank Pilot With inflation making food more costly, food banks and community organizations need help feeding families who struggle to put food on the table. Health Net awarded the Los Angeles (LA) Regional Food Bank a grant to assist members in managing their health through increased food access and nutrition awareness. The LA Food Bank Pilot program provided home-delivered groceries and went beyond food distribution to sponsor an interactive, educational webinar series on nutrition and its role in managing chronic illness. The pilot worked to accomplish the following objectives:

Encourage a relationship between the health plan and its members; Promote healthy lifestyle changes; Provide education on healthy food options and practices; Provide healthy foods to individuals experiencing financial or transportation barriers.

With more than 40 years of experience providing care for the state's most vulnerable residents, Health Net continues to lead the charge to improve health equity with multi-faceted, collaborative and culturally relevant programs and interventions at the statewide and local level.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:28:23+00:00,"Delta Air Lines offered passengers $10,000 each to get off an oversold flight","Passengers on a Delta flight from Michigan to Minnesota say that the airline offered them $10,000 cash to give up their seats on an oversold domestic flight.

In the end, the hour-long flight departed just 20 minutes later than scheduled from Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, according to Cirium’s flight tracker.

Jason Aten, a tech columnist at Inc. magazine, boarded the plane with his family and was waiting for it to leave the gate when a flight attendant came over the intercom, he wrote earlier this week. The crew was looking for eight volunteers to give up their seats on the apparently oversold flight, offering them $10,000 cash each.

“If you have Apple Pay, you’ll even have the money right now,” the flight attendant said, Aten wrote.

Delta, along with other airlines, has canceled huge numbers of flights recently because of major staffing shortages. Holiday weekends in the U.S., including Memorial Day and Juneteenth, have been marked by chaos.

The airline has gone as far as to offer July 4 weekend flight changes at no cost. And on Thursday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized to its customers for a wave of flight cancellations and delays.

“We’ve spent years establishing Delta as the industry leader in reliability, and though the majority of our flights continue to operate on time, this level of disruption and uncertainty is unacceptable,” Bastian wrote to its SkyMiles frequent flier program members in a letter reported by Bloomberg.

Another passenger on the flight out of Grand Rapids, Todd McCrumb took to social media to confirm Aten’s experience. “It’s a true story. I was on that flight!” he tweeted. “Unfortunately, my wife has some health issues and cannot travel alone. She would not bump bc she was anxious to be home, for health issues and some other concerns. I couldn’t abandon her for any amount of $$.”

McCrumb told Fortune there were earlier offers made by the flight crew, and an agent made an opening bid of $5,000 while people were waiting at the gate. After there weren’t any takers, Delta bumped its offer up to $7,500 once boarding began and reached $10,000 by the time most passengers were on board.

Though some passengers got up and took the money immediately, Aten told Fortune it took a second announcement of the $10,000 and 20 minutes of waiting for enough people to take Delta’s cash offer, and the flight to take off.

While the offer was tempting, Aten’s group of eight ultimately turned down what would have been $80,000.

“The reason we didn’t jump on it was because they didn’t initially say how many volunteers they needed. Had we known it was eight, we would have gotten off. By the time that was clear, four or five people had already left,” he said.

When reached for comment by Fortune, a Delta spokesperson did not confirm or deny whether the flight offered passengers $10,000.

“The ability to provide compensation empowers our employees to take care of our customers and get our aircraft out on time,” the spokesperson said.

In 2017, Delta increased its maximum compensation from $1,350 to nearly $10,000 for passengers removed from oversold flights, according to a leaked bulletin to staff published by CNBC. That policy change happened in the wake of United’s 2017 incident, where passenger David Dao refused to give up his seat and ended up being dragged off the plane.

But even today, it is rare for airlines to offer $10,000 for denied boardings, especially for such a short flight and in cash rather than gift cards or travel vouchers.

SVB Leerink says that the new contract implies the price per Comirnaty dose is ~$30.50. Comirnaty U.S. pricing per dose has increased from $19.50 (2020 contracts), to $24 (+23%; 2021 contract), and now to ~$30.50 (+27%). The analysts raised FY22 comirnaty sales estimate to $35 billion from $33 billion, with Pfizer's price target unchanged at $55 and maintaining a Market Perform rating. SVB forecasts Q3 sales of $2 billion, up from the prior outlook of $1.3 billion, and raising Q4 estimate to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. ""The contract size (105 million and up to 300 million) and 27% price bump supports Pfizer's plan to raise vaccine prices coming out of the pandemic,"" SVB notes. At the $30.50 price, another 195 million doses would imply $5.9 billion in additional revenue. These additional doses could also cover each of those individuals for another booster in 2023 and cover the roll-out of the primary series for children under five.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark;June 30, 2022 – Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) today announced its intent to submit a biologics license application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for subcutaneous epcoritamab (DuoBody®-CD3xCD20), an investigational bispecific antibody, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), in the second half of 2022.

The BLA submission is supported by results from the large b-cell lymphoma (LBCL) cohort of the pivotal EPCORE™ NHL-1 open-label, multi-center trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory CD20+ mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). In April 2022, Genmab and AbbVie announced the topline results from EPCORE™ NHL-1 trial. In June 2022, primary results were presented in a late-breaking oral presentation as part of the Presidential Symposium at the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Hematology Association (EHA2022) in Vienna, Austria.

“Relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma is often difficult to treat, and patients are in need of novel therapies that are effective, tolerable and accessible,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “The results from the EPCORE NHL-1 trial, and other clinical trials evaluating epcoritamab in a variety of patients and treatment settings, have demonstrated that epcoritamab has the potential to offer people living with LBCL a new therapeutic advance with a manageable safety profile.”

Epcoritamab is being co-developed by Genmab and AbbVie as part of the companies' oncology collaboration. The companies are committed to evaluating epcoritamab as a monotherapy, and in combination, across lines of therapy in a range of hematologic malignancies, including an ongoing phase 3, open-label, randomized trial evaluating epcoritamab as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (NCT: 04628494).

About Large B-cell Lymphoma (LBCL)
LBCL is a fast-growing type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), a cancer that develops in the lymphatic system and affects B-cell lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. There are an estimated 150,000 new LBCL cases each year globally. LBCL includes DLBCL, which is the most common type of NHL worldwide and accounts for approximately 31 percent of all NHL cases.i,ii,iii,iv

About the EPCORE™ NHL-1 Trial
EPCORE™ NHL-1 is an open-label, multi-center safety and preliminary efficacy trial of epcoritamab including a phase 1 first-in-human, dose escalation part; a phase 2 expansion part; and an optimization part. The trial was designed to evaluate subcutaneous epcoritamab in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory CD20+ mature B-NHL, including LBCL and DLBCL. Data from the dose escalation part of the study, which determined the recommended phase 2 dose, were published in The Lancet in 2021. In the phase 2 expansion part, additional patients are treated with epcoritamab to further explore the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab in patients with different types of relapsed/refractory B-NHLs who had limited therapeutic options.

The primary endpoint of the phase 2 expansion part was overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an IRC. Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response, complete response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, time to response, time to next therapy, and rate of minimal residual disease negativity.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:23:11+00:00,REFILE-US STOCKS-S&amp;P 500 wobbles to the end of its worst first-half since 1970,"(Removes extraneous words in 2nd paragraph)

* U.S. May consumer spending rises moderately; inflation stays hot

* S&P 500 headed for worst first-half since 1970

* Indexes down: Dow 0.35%, S&P 0.20%, Nasdaq 0.45%

By Stephen Culp

NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street slid into the finish line of a dismal month and quarter on Thursday as a continued sell-off put a grim punctuation mark at the close of the S&P 500's worst first-half in more than half a century.

All three major U.S. stock indexes were down but off session lows on the last day of the month and the second quarter, putting the S&P 500 on course for its steepest first-half percentage drop since 1970.

The Nasdaq was on its way to its worst-ever first-half performance, while the Dow appeared on track for its biggest January-June percentage drop since 1962.

All three indexes were bound to post their second straight quarterly declines. That last time that happened was in 2015 for the S&P and the Dow, and 2016 for the Nasdaq.

The year began with spiking cases of COVID-19 due to the Omicron variant. Then came Russia's invasion of Ukraine, decades-high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which have stoked fears of a possible recession.

""The reality is that we will very likely end up in a mild recession,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""From an investor’s perspective, it's important to remember that sell-offs happen well ahead of recession and markets have a history of rising during shallow recessions.""

Economic data released on Thursday did little to allay those fears. Disposable income inched lower, consumer spending decelerated, inflation remained hot and jobless claims inched higher.

""We’ve started to see a slowdown in consumer spending,"" Pursche added. ""And it seems that inflation is taking its toll on the average consumer and that translates to corporate earnings which is what ultimately drives the stock market.""

Story continues

The graphic below shows year-on-year growth of core inflation indicators, all of which suggest that while a peak appears to have been reached in March, they all continue to soar well above the Fed's average annual 2% target:

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 107.49 points, or 0.35%, to 30,921.82, the S&P 500 lost 7.79 points, or 0.20%, to 3,811.04 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 50.13 points, or 0.45%, to 11,127.76.

Of the 11 major sector of the S&P 500, utilities were up the most, with energy suffering the largest percentage drop.

Even so, energy is the sole sector to show a year-to-date gain, aided by crude prices spiking over supply concerns due to Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The major stock indexes are on track to show monthly losses, with the S&P 500 set for its worst June since the Financial Crisis.

Second-quarter reporting season begins in several weeks, and 130 of the companies in the S&P 500 have pre-announced. Of those, 45 have been positive and 77 have been negative, resulting in a negative/positive ratio of 1.7 stronger than the first quarter but weaker than a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.

Worries over inflation dampening consumer demand and threatening profit margins will have market participants listening closely to forward guidance.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc fell 5.6% as its quarterly profit plunged 76%, hurt by its opioid settlement with Florida and a decrease in U.S. pharmacy sales on waning demand for COVID-19 vaccinations.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.36-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 42 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 14 new highs and 342 new lows.

Inotiv, Inc. (NASDAQ: NOTV) Securities Fraud Class Action:

The litigation challenges Inotiv’s claims regarding its Envigo business, which the company acquired in Sept. 2021, including that Envigo maintained “high standards of animal welfare” at its Cumberland, Virginia facility and other animal testing sites.

Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and concealed that: (1) the Cumberland facility engaged in widespread and flagrant violations of the Animal Welfare Act (“AWA”); (2) Envigo and the Cumberland facility continuously violated the AWA; (3) Envigo and Inotiv did not properly remedy issues with regard to animal welfare at Cumberland; (4) as a result, Inotiv was likely to face increased scrutiny and government action; (5) Inotiv would imminently shut down Cumberland; and, (6) Inotiv did not perform proper due diligence of Envigo.

On May 20, 2022, Inotiv announced that on May 18 federal and state law enforcement conducted a search and seizure warrant on the Cumberland facility. The company also announced the DOJ sued Envigo for violations of the ACA.

Then, on May 21, 2022, the court in the DOJ’s case ordered a halt to violations of the AWA at Cumberland. The court’s order observed that hundreds of beagle puppies died in the Cumberland facility (many of which were not given anesthesia before they were euthanized by intracardiac injection), nursing female beagles were denied food, and many puppies died from cold exposure. About 3 weeks later, Inotiv announced it was closing Cumberland.

These events sent the price of Inotiv shares crashing lower.

“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving Inotiv misled investors about its adherence to animal welfare standards,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:22:47+00:00,COVID SCIENCE-Pausing methotrexate improves booster response; first-trimester of pregnancy vaccination most beneficial,"By Nancy Lapid

June 30 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.

Pausing immunosuppression improves COVID-19 booster response

People taking a commonly-used drug for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis get weaker-than-average protection from COVID-19 vaccines, but stopping the drug for two weeks after a booster dose doubled patients' antibody response in a randomized trial.

UK researchers studied 254 adults receiving methotrexate for their conditions who were about to get their third dose of a vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna , or AstraZeneca. Participants were randomly assigned to interrupt methotrexate treatment for two-weeks after the booster, or to continue taking methotrexate as usual. Blood tests one and three months later showed antibody levels were more than twice as high among patients who paused methotrexate for two weeks as among patients who kept taking it. This was true regardless of methotrexate dose, type of inflammatory disease, type of vaccine, and whether or not patients had ever been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Patients' reports of disease flares were slightly more common in the interruption group, but there was no difference between the groups in seeking healthcare input for flares, and there was no impact on quality of life or general health, the researchers reported on Monday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00186-2/fulltext.

""Further research is required to assess whether interruption in treatment with other similarly acting immunosuppressive drugs will also enhance vaccine-induced immunity,"" the researchers said.

First-trimester COVID-19 vaccine particularly beneficial

Pregnant women getting vaccinated against COVID-19 should consider the type and timing of vaccination, new research suggests.

Story continues

The 158 pregnant women in the study received mRNA vaccines from Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech or the adenovirus-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. As reported on Tuesday in Nature Communications https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31169-8, the Moderna shot provided subtle advantages over the Pfizer shot in antibody levels and function, and both RNA vaccines induced more potent antibodies than the J&J shot. Immune responses to the shots were stronger when administered in the first or third trimester compared to the second trimester, while the transfer of protective COVID-19 antibodies to the fetus through the placenta was most efficient following first and second trimester vaccination.

When unvaccinated women become pregnant, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises vaccination as soon as possible to maximize the amount of time during which the mother and fetus are protected from COVID-19. The researchers say their findings show that first-trimester vaccination induces an immune response as good as or better than responses later in pregnancy, along with ""high transfer efficiency"" of antibodies to the fetus. Furthermore, ""maternal and neonatal immunity may be further enhanced by boosting in the third trimester,"" the researchers said.

By Daniel Wiessner

June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday turned away Alaska Airlines Inc's challenge to being bound by the employment laws of states where their workers are based, the central issue in its legal battle with California-based flight attendants.

The justices declined to hear an appeal by Alaska Airlines of a lower court's ruling that Virgin America, which it acquired in 2018, had to give these flight attendants meal and rest breaks required by California law. Industry groups have said the lower court's decision will lead to canceled flights and higher ticket prices.

The court also turned away a separate case by trade group Airlines for America challenging the state of Washington's ability to enforce state employment laws against airlines.

In a statement, Alaska Airlines said it was evaluating how it could comply with California's strict meal and rest break laws while also following federal guidelines requiring airline crew to perform specific duties.

Airlines for America said in a statement ""the lack of a definitive answer from the court does not resolve the conflict between state and federal law ... and will result in a patchwork of costly and conflicting state regulations, as at least 19 states have some form of meal and rest break laws.""

Charles Cooper, a lawyer for a group of flight attendants who sued, said the Supreme Court's action confirms that a lower court ruling against Virgin was correct.

A federal law bars states from adopting measures that affect the prices, routes and services offered by airlines. But the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year decided that state wage laws that generally apply to all workers also cover airline employees because they have only an indirect impact on airline services.

The 9th Circuit threw out the Washington state lawsuit a few days later, citing its ruling in Virgin's case.

Story continues

Alaska Airlines in its petition to the Supreme Court to hear its appeal said federal law was designed to impose a uniform nationwide standard for airlines to follow. Forcing airlines to give California-based flight attendants breaks while in the air would interfere with takeoffs and landings, ""leaving planes stranded on runways at unpredictable times and causing cascading delays at airports nationwide,"" the airline said.

The Virgin flight attendants accused the airline of various violations of California law in a 2015 lawsuit.

Airlines for America told the Supreme Court in a brief last year that imposing state requirements on the industry would increases labor costs, leading to reduced services and higher prices for flights.

Alaska Airlines was also backed in its appeal by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobby, and 19 Republican-led states.

Pertinent factors that are driving the market growth:

A surge in demand for devices

There has been increasing use of endoscopic devices due to the overall increase in the number of endoscopic procedures performed. The devices enable surgeons better visual access to the surgical site. As per a study conducted by the Japan Society of Gynecologic and Obstetric Endoscopy, over 67,000 endoscopic procedures were carried out in 3 years. In the US, over 75 million endoscopic procedures were performed. According to a study published in the British Medical Journal, over 2 million endoscopic procedures were carried out in the study period. Thus, with a staggering use of endoscopic procedures for accurate diagnoses, we would see further demand for the devices in the years to come.

Increasing Gastrointestinal (GI) Disorder Cases

There has been a steady increase in GI diseases. According to statistics from the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), approximately 60 to 70 million people are affected by a digestive disease. Further, the report specifies that nearly 63 million people are affected by constipation. According to the United European Gastroenterology report, over one million deaths are caused each year due to liver and GI diseases. With the rising prevalence of GI diseases, we would see an uptick demand for endoscopic devices.

Ageing Population in Developed Countries.

Globally, developed countries have a rising population of people over 60. According to the UN, by 2050, nearly 25% of the total population of Europe and North America will be above the age of 60. The World Economic Forum report on ageing shows that fertility rates have dropped 50% in the last 70 years, meaning there are fewer younger people in general. Additionally, the global median age also increased from 25 years to 33 years. Worldbank statistics show that as of 2020, the population of people above 60 in Japan is approximately 28% of the population. With the overall rise in the age of the population, there will be an increase in health conditions, especially GI diseases, as they tend to affect people above the age of 35. Therefore, with a steep rise in the geriatric population, there will be an increased demand for endoscopic devices.

Based on product, the endoscopy visualization systems held the highest market share at 36.5%. The systems enable physicians to assess the patients’ condition using devices and software. The use of visualization systems has become indispensable in diagnosing GI diseases. NIDDK statistics suggest that gallstones are prevalent in approximately 20 million US citizens, with over a million cases presented yearly. Gallstones are one the most common GI conditions that require hospitalization. CDC reports also suggest that there are over 48 million cases of food-borne illnesses that present with GI symptoms. As per Eurostat, salmonella is one of the most commonly occurring GI diseases in the region. Therefore, with the increased prevalence of disease presenting with GI symptoms, we would see an exponential increase in the demand for endoscopic devices.

By application, the gastrointestinal endoscopy segment dominated the segment with 53.2% of the total revenue. There is a high occurrence of GI diseases such as haemorrhoids, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and pancreatitis. CDC statistics suggest there are between 4.9 to 35 cases per 100,000 of pancreatitis. NIDDK statistics estimate nearly 15.3 million people suffer from irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, 75% of the US population above 45 suffer from haemorrhoids. The CDC recommends colonoscopies for those above 50; hence, over 18 million colonoscopies will be performed in 2021. Thus, we would see the market develop further with a rising number of endoscopic procedures.

By end-user, hospitals dominated the market due to the rising number of diagnostic tests and surgical procedures involving endoscopes. According to a study, on an average, over 112,000 endoscopies were performed in UK hospitals. Between 2020 and May 2022, over 61 hospitals were added to the US healthcare systems. As per the European Commission report on healthcare, over 25% of all European countries spend over 10% of their GDP on healthcare, with Switzerland’s allocation being the highest at 12.7%. Thus, with increased spending on healthcare, and the rising number of hospitals, in addition to the increasing prevalence of diseases, we would see an increase in the demand for endoscopic devices.

Going forward, Skyworks Solutions is expected to generate growth from a number of potential catalysts. Demand for connectivity to start rapidly expanding across multiple essential wireless protocols, including 5G, advanced Wi-Fi and precision GPS.

Skyworks’ management team provided an outlook for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2022. They anticipate revenue between $1.200 billion and $1.260 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.36 at the midpoint. We expect 8% annual EPS growth over the next five years.

Skyworks has enjoyed tremendous growth over the past decade thanks to smartphones’ proliferation that use its chips. The company increased EPS by double-digit percentages each year in the past five and 10-year periods. These past two years of 2020 and 2021 saw a significant upturn for many semiconductor companies, including Skyworks.

Skyworks stock trades for a 2022 P/E ratio of 8.4. Our fair value P/E is 15 for Skyworks, which implies significant upside for the stock. Shares also have a dividend yield of 2.4%. Total returns could reach 22% per year over the next five years.

Lennox International (LII) dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.

Next among dividend stocks is Lennox International, a company that manufactures and sells HVAC products (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning). About 94% of sales come from North America (particularly the U.S. and Canada), and about 6% of sales are international.

The company operates through three segments: residential heating and cooling, commercial heating and cooling, and refrigeration, which made up 66%, 21%, and 13% of 2021 sales, respectively. To preface this business, 75% of sales come from replacements, and only 25% of sales come from new construction – which means that this business’s performance isn’t directly tied to new home sales.

On the residential side, the company is focused on geographic expansion of their store footprint, so they can serve more households. At the end of 2021, the business had 232 stores, and the company expects to add 30 stores in 2022 to bring the store total to 262. The business wants to have 350 stores by 2026.

In the 2022 first quarter, Lennox generated $2.36 in adjusted earnings-per-share, up 4% year-over-year, and revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $1.01 billion. Revenue and profits grew in the residential and refrigeration segments. Overall, the strong performance on the residential side masked underperformance on the commercial side.

The company has a strong track record of growth. In the past five years the company grew its earnings-per-share by 12% annually. Dividends rose 18% per year in the same period. Lennox International has grown dividend payments for 14 consecutive years.

Lennox stock trades for a 2022 P/E of 14.2, which is significantly below its 10-year average around 21. Lennox recently hiked its dividend by 15% and the stock now yields 2.1%. We also expect the company to grow earnings-per-share by 10% per year. As a result, total returns could exceed 20% per year over the next five years.

Dividend Stocks: Ally Financial (ALLY) The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.

Ally Financial, our last dividend stocks entry, provides financial services to consumers, businesses, automotive dealers and corporate clients. Its segments include automotive finance, insurance, mortgage finance and corporate finance. Its services include term loans, lines of credit, fleet financing, vehicle financing, commercial insurance products, etc.

Ally also has a held-for-investment consumer mortgage finance loan portfolio with mortgages that were originated by third parties.

7 Growth Stocks to Buy for a Rich Retirement

Ally reported first-quarter earnings results on April 14. The company reported revenues totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter, which was 11% more than its revenues during the same quarter a year ago.

Ally originated $12 billion in new consumer auto loans during the quarter and managed to grow deposits by $1.3 billion during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, retail deposits totaled $136 billion. Due to lower provisions and higher revenues, Ally’s bottom-line performance improved markedly on a year-over-year basis, and the company managed to hit net earnings of more than $700 million during the quarter.

ALLY stock earnings-per-share during the first quarter were strong, as the company generated profits of $2.03 per share. Earnings-per-share showed a strong recovery in 2021, as earnings-per-share hit a new record level of $8.60. It is expected that Ally Financial’s earnings-per-share will decline in 2022 due to lower reserve releases, but profits should nevertheless remain well above pre-pandemic levels this year. We expect 3% annual EPS growth over the next five years.

Ally is a shareholder-friendly company that returns cash aggressively through buybacks and dividends. On Jan. 11, the company simultaneously announced a 20% dividend increase and $2 billion share buyback authorization, which represents approximately 18% of the stock’s current market cap. Shares currently have a dividend yield of 3.5%.

The company has increased its dividend for six consecutive years. Ally will pay around 15% of its earnings in the form of dividends this year. This low of a payout ratio leaves plenty of room for future dividend increases.

The stock trades for a 2022 P/E ratio of just 4.3; our fair value P/E is 7.5 which leaves potential returns above 17% per year over the next five years.

SEATTLE, June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: RDFN) —More and more, home sellers are ceding to the mounting pressure on affordability posed by this month's rapid mortgage-rate hike, according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage.

The median asking price of newly-listed homes for sale is down 1.5% from the all-time high it reached in the spring, and a record-high share of sellers dropped their asking price during the four-week period ending June 26. Pending sales continued to fall, posting their largest decline since May 2020, but there are signs that early-stage homebuyer demand is starting to level off.

""Data on home-tours, offers and mortgage purchase applications suggest that homebuyers have noticed the shift in power and are no longer leaving the market in droves,"" said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather. ""Buyers coming back will provide support to the housing market, but between now and the end of year I think the power will continue to shift towards buyers, resulting in mild price declines from month to month.""

""Homebuyers are worried about interest rates, having to go back to the office, getting laid off, and wondering if they can get a better deal by waiting out the market,"" said Redfin Seattle-area real estate agent Caroline Loudenback. ""On the other side, sellers are adjusting to this new reality and learning that sometimes there’s not much they can do to increase buyer interest. Sometimes price isn’t even the reason a home is sitting on the market without selling—some more remote areas that were super popular during the pandemic are now being overlooked as buyers reconsider long commutes with high gas prices. It’s a tricky market and you have to pay close attention to your local sales and listings to understand what’s happening.""

Story continues

Leading indicators of homebuying activity:

For the week ending June 30, 30-year mortgage rates fell slightly to 5.7%. Fewer people searched for ""homes for sale"" on Google—searches during the week ending June 25 were down 7% from a year earlier. The seasonally-adjusted Redfin Homebuyer Demand Index—a measure of requests for home tours and other home-buying services from Redfin agents—was down 15% year over year during the week ending June 26, but up 7 points from the previous week. Touring activity as of June 26 fell 3% from the start of the year, compared to a 24% increase at this time last year, according to home tour technology company ShowingTime. Mortgage purchase applications were down 24% from a year earlier, while the seasonally-adjusted index was up 0.1% week over week during the week ending June 17.

Key housing market takeaways for 400+ U.S. metro areas:

Unless otherwise noted, this data covers the four-week period ending June 26. Redfin’s weekly housing market data goes back through 2015.

The median home sale price was up 14% year over year to a record $399,249. The median asking price of newly listed homes increased 15% year over year to $405,547, but was down 1.5% from the all-time high set during the four-week period ending May 22. The monthly mortgage payment on the median asking price home increased to $2,459 at the current 5.7% mortgage rate, but is down slightly from the peak of $2,494 during the four-week period ending June 12. This was up 45% from $1,694 a year earlier, when mortgage rates were 2.98%. Pending home sales were down 13% year over year, the largest decline since May 2020. New listings of homes for sale were down 7% from a year earlier. Active listings (the number of homes listed for sale at any point during the period) fell 8% year over year—the smallest decline since March 2020. 46% of homes that went under contract had an accepted offer within the first two weeks on the market, down from 49% a year earlier. 32% of homes that went under contract had an accepted offer within one week of hitting the market, down from 36% a year earlier. Homes that sold were on the market for a median of 17 days, down from 18 days a year earlier and up slightly from the record low of 15 days set in May and early June. 54% of homes sold above list price, up from 53% a year earlier. This measure peaked in mid-May and has declined 2.5 points since then. Last year it peaked in mid-July. On average, 6.5% of homes for sale each week had a price drop, a record high as far back as the data goes, through the beginning of 2015. The average sale-to-list price ratio, which measures how close homes are selling to their asking prices, declined to 102.2%. In other words, the average home sold for 2.2% above its asking price. This was up from 102.1% a year earlier.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:10:57+00:00,How Heinz provoked Tesco in the battle of the beans,"heinz baked beans

The selection of beans on Tesco’s shelves are already noticeably limited. Visitors used to a sea of Heinz Beanz cans were instead met with gaping holes on Thursday. Online, notices of “this product’s currently out of stock” floated under many of Heinz’s best-known items.

While it may seem reminiscent of pre-lockdown panic buying, this time Tesco is not racing to re-stock Heinz goods.

On Wednesday, the two sides went head to head following Heinz’s decision to pause supply of its beans and ketchup to the grocer after a pricing dispute.

“We will not pass on unjustifiable price increases to our customers,” said Tesco, which is headed by chief executive Ken Murphy. “We’re sorry that this means some products aren’t available right now.”

Heinz countered that it was facing significant increases in commodity and production costs and wanted to provide goods at the right price “without compromising quality”.

The US company said it always sought to “provide value through price, size and packs.... at a price point that works within their budgets”.

The row has thrown the spotlight on the tricky relationship between suppliers and supermarkets: it comes six years after Unilever brands Marmite, PG Tips tea and Pot Noodles disappeared from shelves in a similar wrangling, and five years after Heineken brands were pulled. This time, inflation has sparked tension.

“Delistings are rare,” says Jefferies’ Martin Deboo. “More often than not, they materialise as a margin risk for the supplier, due to the retailer driving a hard bargain, rather than absence from the shelves.

“Bargaining power favours the retailer,” he adds, explaining that a company such as Heinz would rely more on sales from Tesco’s customers than vice versa.

However, the pressure will be mounting for a resolution on both sides. While more customers than ever are swapping to own-brand and value items, industry insiders say Heinz products are emblematic for supermarkets – key brands that sell well and draw customers to the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury’s, whose private label options are more limited than discounters such as Aldi.

Story continues baked beans heinz branston tesco - Paul Grover for the Telegraph

According to insiders, this means the food manufacturer can be tougher on price demands. Heinz is understood to have asked for a more than 30pc price increase at some retailers, described by one industry insider as “unheard of”.

Retail data suggests prices of Heinz products have already risen. According to figures compiled for The Telegraph by Assosia, the average price of a 415g tin of Heinz Baked Beanz at supermarkets is up 22pc since the start of the year. Ketchup, meanwhile, has risen 17pc.

Increases at Tesco have so far not been as pronounced as elsewhere. The supermarket raised its price for baked beans from 85p to £1 last December – a hike of 17.6pc, according to the figures. Asda, however, increased theirs from 90p to £1.20 earlier this month – up 33.3pc – and Sainsbury’s from £1 to £1.20, or 20pc.

For ketchup, Morrisons raised its prices by the most – from £2 to £2.79 for a 460g squeezy bottle, in a 39.5pc increase.

The costs of rival brands have risen less sharply. Branston beans are up by an average of 6.7pc since last May, the data showed, and own-label ketchup is up just 6.3pc across retailers since last summer.

“In all fairness to Heinz, who knows what issues they've actually got?” says one canned foods importer, adding that their own costs have been rising in all areas. “There's just nothing that hasn't gone up substantially. Nothing.”

Tomatoes, which used to cost between €7 and €9 (£6 and £7.8) a case are now €15. Prices have gone up 25pc on beans.

Heinz last year cautioned over inflation “across the board”, saying it was struggling with a lack of truck drivers and soaring commodity prices.

Logistics for Heinz’s UK production could also pose a problem. It makes its Baked Beanz at a site in Kitt Green, Wigan, producing 3m cans per day. The UK consumes an average of 2.5m cans of its beans every day.

To make the final product, the company rehydrates imported beans from North America, before combining them with spices and tomato sauce to cook in the can. Relying on imports can lead to further costs amid surging fuel prices.

These challenges will be at the forefront of Heinz’s mind as it faces off against Tesco – a company which has positioned itself as a consumer champion in this battle. Some say the supermarket will ultimately have to give in.

“Here we go again,” says Ged Futter, a former senior Asda buyer. “Of course they will be passing it on… As a wise man once said 'you can't sell fresh air', it might be worth reminding a few of the retailers of this as they seem to have forgotten it.”

Even if a resolution is reached, there are signs the tussle between suppliers and retailers could run for some time. Other suppliers could soon follow and threaten to pull items if they cannot get the price they request.

Earlier this month, Mark White, the head of the grocery watchdog, said inflation had “affected the entire groceries sector as witnessed by the sheer scale of requests from suppliers to increase prices.”

Although he is not able to directly intervene in pricing talks – and can only take action if items are pulled without enough notice – White said he was “concerned that the pressure has impaired relationships and created wider problems”.

“My priority is to work with all the retailers to ensure they treat their suppliers fairly as they navigate the cost price process during this difficult time.”

According to the latest official figures, released this month, only 47pc of suppliers had not faced any code-related issues with retailers in 2022. Retailers have to abide by the code, which is enforced by an independent regulator and includes requirements such as giving suppliers enough notice if items are being taken off shelves.

Earlier this month the regulator said this suggested that “following two years of pandemic where retailers and suppliers worked closely together and improved their relationships, the pressure from rising prices has strained relationships”.

That strain is clearly playing in the dwindling baked bean cans on Tesco’s shelves.

“We are confident of a positive resolution with Tesco,” Heinz said this week.

Yet, for now, Tesco shoppers will have to get used to the fact it is no longer the case that ‘Beanz means Heinz’.",https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/heinz-provoked-tesco-battle-beans-181057564.html,"['KHC.MX', 'KHC.US', 'KHCB34.SA', 'KHNZ.F', 'KHNZ.XETRA', 'TSCDF.US', 'TSCDY.US', 'TSCO.LSE']"

LOS ANGELES --News Direct-- The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth

LOS ANGELES, June 24, 2022 /3BL Media/ - During the 9th Summit of the Americas held in Los Angeles, California, Mastercard reinforced its commitment to advancing financial and digital inclusion in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras with a new set of commitments and programs focused on advancing economic empowerment for women and girls in the region. The commitments are part of Mastercard’s engagement, as a founding member, in the Partnership for Central America (PCA).

According to the Latin American Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CELIEM) Women's Entrepreneurship Monitor of 2022, 60% of women business owners in Central America said they finance their business activities with their own resources due to lack of access to financing options, while the high costs to formalize their business presents yet another obstacle.

Mastercard is working to address these challenges by ensuring women entrepreneurs can access and leverage necessary tools and resources to start, build and grow their businesses as integral foundations for their communities. This includes a commitment to digitize 300,000 women-owned and -led businesses in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador over the next five years – providing them with accessible digital financial tools to increase sales and access to credit that will enable them to expand their business, foster sustainability and further their contribution to their local economies.

“We know communities see exponential returns when we empower women, and particularly women entrepreneurs, with the tools, capital and resources necessary to sustain and grow their businesses,” said Michael Froman, vice chairman and president, Strategic Growth, for Mastercard. “In working across the public and private sector, our priority needs to center on the long-term prosperity of these entrepreneurs and their businesses as critical contributors to the local economy and job creation.”

Driving impact through collective action

The company is also leveraging the power of collective action by partnering with organizations including Accion, INCAE Business School, Cargill and PriceSmart. Enabled by initial support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, Accion, in partnership with Fundacion Genesis Empresarial (Génesis), they will develop an innovation ecosystem for fintech startups in the agricultural and small business sector. The ecosystem will empower one million women and other social innovation startup founders to access business and technology partnerships, data exchange standards, open banking frameworks, and funding over five years.

In collaboration with PriceSmart and Cargill, Mastercard will work with long-time partner INCAE Business School to launch the Women’s Business Growth Initiative, an effort to support 120 women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Honduras and Guatemala and help them to gain access to markets and capital to grow their businesses and support job creation.

“The global pandemic has exacerbated inequalities around the world. According to the World Bank, women have been most impacted in terms of employment and income loss. For Mastercard, driving a sustainable and equitable digital economy where everyone can thrive means providing female entrepreneurs and micro and small business owners the financial tools, access to capital and networks needed to grow and sustain their businesses. It means inspiring young girls to see a future career in technology and business so that the next generation of women will be even more empowered than the next,” said Carlo Enrico, president, Mastercard Latin America and Caribbean. “We look forward to collaborating with partners, governments and civil society organizations to create the impact needed to make a difference.”

Expanding financial literacy for financial inclusion

Financial literacy is vital for the adoption of financial tools that are necessary for economic development. Through Mastercard’s Cuentas Claras digital financial literacy program in Central America, the company has reached more than seven million people (55% female) with information on topics such as savings, loans, opening a bank account and more since the program started in 2020.

Empowering the next generation of women leaders

In addition to supporting current women-owned and -led businesses, Mastercard also commits to inspiring the next generation of women leaders to pursue a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) through its award-winning Girls4Tech program. Mastercard will provide 5,000 girls in Northern Central America education in STEM principles connected to the topics core to its payments business (i.e. fraud detection, artificial intelligence, cryptography, among others) over the next five years. The company will celebrate today’s announcement by hosting an inaugural Girls4Tech session on June 8 with 100 girls from participating schools in Guatemala City.

Expanding the benefits of financial inclusion to everyone in Northern Central America

Most recently, Mastercard announced the launch of a new financial inclusion program in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras with the objective of accelerating financial inclusion for five million unbanked individuals and digitizing one million micro and small businesses (MSMBs) over the course of five years. Under the new program, the company will work with partner banks to encourage and enable them to offer the best financial tools and solutions to unbanked individuals and MSMB owners that need access to capital and the tools to digitize their business. Solutions include digital and physical debit or prepaid Mastercard card programs for consumers and micro business cards for MSMB owners. In addition, consumers and MSMBs will be able to make and receive digital payments for things like accessing social benefits, remittances (including person-to-person), point-of-sale purchases, access to small business financing, and more.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:10:00+00:00,Center for Identification Technology Research Celebrates 20th Year,"Potsdam, NY, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), based at Clarkson University, is celebrating its 20th year.

CITeR, which performs research in the growing areas of identity science and biometric recognition, is a National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center. Biometrics is the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral traits. Centers like CITeR focus on the needs of industry and government through collaborations between these groups and universities.

Stephanie Schuckers, Clarkson's Paynter-Krigman Endowed Professor in Engineering Science, serves as director of CITeR.

""At points, we wondered whether this research would become a 'solved' problem, and then new challenges would emerge: spoof detection, biometric cryptography, altered finger detection, biometrics at a distance, biometric permanence, and more,"" she says. ""And now, here we are in 2022, with additional challenges such as face morphing, deepfakes, bias, template security, biometrics in children and many others.""

Since awarding its first research grants in 2002, CITeR has performed cutting-edge research as new problems evolve each year.

Some fundamental scientific studies funded by CITeR examine permanence -- how a trait remains essentially unchanged throughout one's lifetime -- in aging adults and children. The research found that accurate identification by fingerprint in adults remained high over a 12- 15 -year period. CITeR researchers have also studied biometric recognition in children, which has applications in areas including immigration, refugee efforts and distribution of benefits. The findings show that identification by irises is stable for the three years they studied in children aged 4 to 11, and face recognition algorithms fail over a three-year period.

In the last three years, CITeR researchers have also developed several single and differential morph detectors to circumvent the problem of morph attacks. Face morphing is the process of combining two or more subjects in an image to create a new identity that contains features of both individuals. Morphed images can fool facial recognition systems into falsely accepting multiple people, leading to failures in national security and border control applications.

Single morph detectors are used during passport applications to authenticate if the submitted passport photo is a real or morphed image. Differential detectors are used to validate if the photo of the passport holder is the same as the photo in the passport.

Other current and past CITeR research highlights include cross-spectral face recognition; noncontact fingerprint recognition; template security and privacy; bias in face recognition; presentation attack detection (liveness detection); and soft and novel biometrics.

An anniversary celebration was held May 10-12 as part of CITeR's semiannual program review for industry and government affiliates and guests. The event was hosted at the Buffalo Museum of Science and University at Buffalo and included a keynote by University Distinguished Professor Anil K. Jain of Michigan State University and technical presentations on CITeR's ongoing research projects.

CITeR was founded in 2001 and held its first meeting in 2002. Lawrence Hornak at West Virginia University (WVU) was the founding director and was joined by Anil Jain from Michigan State University and Jim Wayman from San Jose State University. WVU faculty included Bojan Cukic, Michael Schuckers, Tim Norman and Stephanie Schuckers. In 2002, Bojan Cukic moved to the co-director role. Today, there are 40 active faculty members.

In 2011, Stephane Schuckers became CITeR director. Over time, CITeR also added the University of Arizona, University at Buffalo, Michigan State University and an international site, the Idiap Research Institute in Martigny, Switzerland.

The key to CITeR’s success is the participation of its affiliates. IUCRCs are unique in that their affiliates become directly involved in all phases of the center's research from planning to completion.

At the time of its 2002 founding, CITeR had five affiliates: the Department of Defense — Office/Biometrics Fusion Center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency, the Biometrics Foundation, and Viisage.

Today, CITeR boasts 22 members: ACV Auctions, Army Futures Command — Combat Capabilities Development, Command Armaments Center (CCDC — Armaments), Athena Sciences, Aware Inc., Cyber Street Solutions, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC), Department of Defense — Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA), Department of Homeland Security — Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM), Department of Homeland Security — Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IDEMIA, National Security Agency, Precise Biometrics, Public Safety Canada, Qualcomm Incorporated, SICPA, Synolo Biometrics Inc., TECH5, Veridium, and Xator Corporation.

The global market rout has wiped $13 trillion off world stocks in the worst start to any year on record as business and consumer confidence collapses amid surging inflation.

The MSCI World Equity Index has shed more than 20pc so far this year in the steepest first-half decline since its creation, led by a plunge in loss-making tech companies as investors panic over the end of ultra-low interest rates.

In the UK, the FTSE 100 fell 1.96pc on Thursday to close out its worst month since the early days of the Covid pandemic.

All but ten stocks closed in the red, reducing the value of blue chip companies by £50bn, amid fears the country will suffer the steepest recession in Europe.

It came after official figures revealed that British families have suffered the longest fall in disposable income ever, with a decline of 1.3pc in the year to March 2022.

Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “Although GDP and consumer spending won’t fall as far as real incomes, it’s pretty clear that the economy is going to be very weak for a while. A recession is a real risk.”

Wall Street also suffered heavy losses on Thursday as fears of a slowdown were compounded by data showing that inflation-adjusted US consumer spending fell in May for the first time this year.

The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.7pc, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 2.4pc. The S&P 500 has shed 20pc so far this year, marking its worst first half of the year since 1970 and its worst performance over two quarters since the financial crisis in 2008.

The Nasdaq posted its biggest ever declines over the same period, losing $5.4 trillion in value.

Investor worries deepened this week as top central bankers reiterated their commitment to raise interest rates to tackle a surge in prices fuelled by Russia's war in Ukraine.

Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, warned that Britain faces a faster and steeper downturn than other rich countries, but still vowed to act “more forcefully” if high inflation – currently forecast to peak at 11pc in October – persists.

Story continues

Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, insisted he would not allow the US economy to slip into a “higher inflation regime”.

Policymakers are expected to announce the second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate rise next month.

In a further sign of the strain on families, data released on Thursday showed UK household incomes fell for a fourth straight quarter at the start of the year.

Adjusted for inflation, disposable incomes dropped 0.2pc in the first three months of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics, leaving incomes 1.3pc lower than a year earlier, even before the impact of a jump in energy bills and taxes in April.

The ONS figures also confirmed that the economy grew 0.8pc in the first quarter. However, the Bank of England expects a contraction in the second quarter as inflation continues to rise and consumers cut spending.

This gloom sent the FTSE 100 down more than 6pc in June, the biggest monthly slump since the first wave of coronavirus triggered a market crash in March 2020.

Market chaos also spread to cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin racking up its biggest quarterly loss in more than a decade.

The 58pc plunge in the world’s biggest digital coin is the largest since the third quarter of 2011, when Bitcoin was still in its infancy, according to Bloomberg data.

The notoriously volatile sector has suffered a torrid period as interest rates rise and investors flee riskier assets, while a string of high-profile crashes and a looming regulatory crackdown have fuelled fears of a “crypto winter”.",https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/13-trillion-wiped-off-markets-180816772.html,"['FTSE.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX']"
AAPL,2022-06-30T18:08:00+00:00,"ATTENTION UBS YES INVESTORS:  Law Firm Dimond Kaplan &amp; Rothstein, P.A. Alerts YES Investors of $25 Million SEC Fine","MIAMI and LOS ANGELES, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National investment fraud law firm Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. (“DKR”) (http://www.dkrpa.com) alerts investors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has fined UBS Financial Services, Inc. (“UBS”) $25 million for misconduct relating to UBS’s sales of the UBS Yield Enhancement Strategy (“YES”). UBS is a subsidiary of UBS Group A.G. (NYSE: UBS).

YES is a complex options strategy that UBS sold as a way for investors to receive a modest amount of income. The SEC found that UBS failed to adequately train its brokers about YES and failed to disclose to investors (or even to UBS brokers) the significant downside risk of YES, which UBS’s daily internal reports reflected. The SEC also found that UBS’s risk disclosures were inadequate and that UBS engaged in “fraud and deceit” upon YES investors.

Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. Has Recovered Millions of Dollars for YES Investors

Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. has been representing YES investors since early 2019. To date, DKR has recovered YES losses for more than 20 YES investors and the firm continues to prosecute YES cases for clients throughout the United States.

The SEC’s findings against UBS are consistent with the theories that DKR has been using in its cases against UBS. Based on numerous discussions with UBS brokers, it is apparent that in addition to failing to disclose information about YES to investors, UBS even kept important information about YES from its own brokers. As a result, we believe that many UBS brokers did not understand YES.

YES Loss Recovery Through FINRA Arbitration

UBS YES investors can file FINRA arbitration claims in an effort to recover their losses. FINRA arbitration is a private dispute resolution process for disputes with brokerage firms.

If you lost money in the UBS YES options strategy, contact Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. DKR has extensive experience representing YES investors. With offices in Miami, Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, and New York Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. represents investors throughout the United States, Mexico, and Latin America in stockbroker negligence and brokerage firm misconduct cases.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:03:30+00:00,6 Strong Dividend Stocks to Buy for High Inflation,"This article today is about six strong dividend stocks to buy for high inflation. They have higher yields than the current inflation rate, which as of June 10, was reported to be 8.6% in the last 12 months.

Most of these stocks are REITs (real estate investment trusts) or MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships) which are required to pay out 90% of their net income in order to keep their non-taxable status. MLPs tend to be focused on the oil and gas industry, although they are not required to be there.

REITs are focused on the real estate industry — 75% of their income must come from related real estate activities, including rents, mortgage interest, or gains from the sale of the property. Just like MLPs, 90% of their income must be distributed. REITs tend to use leverage to enhance their income.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

These two industries tend to be focused on producing cash flow that can be distributed to investors. That makes them ideally suited to produce strong dividends to battle inflation.

In addition, some of these stocks are business development companies (BDCs), which are also regulated investment companies. They also must pay out 90% of their income. However, BDCs must invest at least 70% of their assets in businesses worth $250 million or less.

Many BDCs have high dividend yields because they invest in debt instruments from private companies on a leveraged basis. One really good source of information we use for these stocks is BDCinvestor.com.

7 REITs to Buy for a Bear Market

Let’s dive in and look at these stocks.

CCAP Crescent Capital $15.28 CGBD Carlyle Secured Lending $12.61 FSK FS KKR Capital Corp $19.16 OHI Omega Healthcare Investors $29.10 OPI Office Properties Income Trust $20 GLP Global Partners LP $23.88

Dividend Stocks To Buy: Crescent Capital (CCAP) A man counts money he's holding.

Dividend Yield: 10.7%

Crescent Capital (NASDAQ:CCAP) is a $489 million market cap BDC that invests in the debt of middle-market companies in the U.S. Its present dividend rate is $1.64 annually, based on a “regular dividend” of 41 cents quarterly rate. That alone gives the stock a stated yield of 10.7% at Wednesday’s close of $15.28.

Story continues

However, the company has also started paying a 5-cent special dividend for the past three quarters. That works out to 46 cents in quarterly dividends in total, or $1.84 annually, if it continues.

Therefore, its real run rate dividend yield now is 12.04% (i.e., $1.84/$15.28) — again, assuming that the extra special 5 cents quarterly dividend continues.

For example, the company declared four of these special dividends on Nov. 10, 2021. CCAP has already paid three of them. The fourth will be paid on July 15, for shareholders of record as of June 29. That means it is too late to get this fourth special dividend. It is not yet clear if the company will renew a new round of special cash dividends.

I would not necessarily count on the extra 5 cents continuing if the U.S. is in a deep recession. Many companies will begin defaulting on their debt obligations. That will make it harder for Cresent Capital to keep up the extra payments. So investors should probably just count on the $1.64 dividend annually for now — and a 10.7% yield is still significantly higher than inflation.

Another reason to hang on to CCAP stock is that its net asset value (NAV), as of March 31 was $21.18. So, at a price of $15.28, the stock trades for just 72% of its NAV. That means a lot of bad news, in terms of discounting its loan assets, is already in the stock price. That makes it a very conservative investment.

Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) a man sitting on a chair, typing on a laptop while cash falls from the ceiling

Yield: 12.7%

Just like Crescent Capital above Carlyle Secured Lending (NASDAQ:CGBD) is a BDC that pays two types of quarterly dividends. But it calls its larger dividend a “base” dividend, for 32 cents quarterly. The “supplemental” dividend is 8 cents, bringing the total quarterly dividend to 40 cents, and $1.60 on a run rate. This gives it a total run-rate yield of 12.7% at a price of $12.61 on June 29.

This language is different than a “regular” and “special” dividend like at Crescent. Moreover, Carlyle does not pre-announce four quarters of special dividends like at Crescent. It announces the special dividends each quarter along with the base dividend.

However, the quarterly base and supplemental rates have jumped around a good deal. For example, last year the total quarterly dividends ranged from 40 cents to 46 cents. But starting in 2022, the 32 cents base and 8 cents supplemental dividends became the norm.

I think investors can continue to count on the 32 cents base dividend. But the supplemental amounts could be lower each quarter. Therefore the total yield now at a price of $12.61 is $1.60/$12.61, or 12.7%. But it could be as low as 10.15% (i.e., (32 cents x 4) / $12.61).

However, for the time being, I suspect investors can count on the full 40-cent total quarterly dividends. That 12.7% yield makes it one of the strong dividend stocks to buy to beat inflation.

7 Growth Stocks to Buy for a Rich Retirement

Given the uncertainty due to the extra smaller dividends, CGBD trades at a discount to NAV. As of March 31, its NAV was $17.11. So the discount ($12.61/$17.11) is 73.7%. That is another major reason to buy CGBD stock.

Dividend Yield: 14.2%

Like other two other above BDCs above that are managed by private equity companies, FS KKR Capital Corp (NYSE:FSK) invests in middle-market company loans. However, it pays a total quarterly dividend with no special or supplemental features like the other two BDCs. However, FSK stock’s quarterly dividend announcements bounce around depending on that quarter’s profits.

For example, last quarter FSK paid a 68-cent dividend, up from 63 cents in the quarter before that and 62 cents earlier. So, at Wednesday’s closing price of $19.16, the stock has a dividend yield of 14.2%.

Moreover, just like the other two BDCs, FSK is well below its quarterly NAV price.  Last quarter its NAV was $27.33, up from $27.17 at the end of Dec. 31. that puts it at just 70.1% of its NAV.

This makes it one of the cheapest and highest-yielding strong dividend stocks to buy to beat inflation.

Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) a doctor looks at a tablet

Dividend Yield: 9.2%

Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) is a REIT run by the large Omega private equity firm that is focused on investing in facilities run by skilled nursing and assisted living operators. For the past several years it has paid a quarterly dividend of 67 cents, or $2.68 annually. At Wednesday’s closing price of $29.10, this gives the stock a yield of 9.2%.

That gives investors a good deal of stability compared to the high-yield BDCs earlier mentioned on this list. They have variable dividends each quarter and investors can’t count on a regular level. Sometimes more stability gives the stock a higher valuation.

For example, its tangible book value is $13.71. So the stock’s price-to TBV is over 2.1 times. That means the market is willing to value this stock as an operating company rather than a mutual fund or regulated investment company like BDCs.

This is important since the company is actively buying back its shares. That lowers the shares outstanding and increases the ability of the company to raise its dividends on a per-share basis in the future.

7 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever

Moreover, its yield is well over the 8.6% CPI inflation rate, making it one of the strong dividend stocks to buy to cover inflation.

Dividend Yield: 11%

This company is also an REIT that invests in office properties and leases them to high-quality organizations like government entities. Office Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ:OPI) pays a quarterly dividend of 55 cents each quarter and has done so for the past several years.

So at Wednesday’s closing price of $20, its annual run-rate dividend of $2.20 gives it an annual yield of 11%. Moreover, its tangible book value per share is $30.09. That means its price-to-TBV per share is 66.5%.

This makes it a typical value stock, trading at two-thirds of book value with a high dividend yield. It is one of the best dividend stocks to buy to beat inflation.

Dividend Yield: 10%

Global Partners LP (NYSE:GLP) is an MLP that invests in gasoline-producing facilities. It engages in the purchasing, selling, gathering, blending, storing, and logistics of transporting gasoline and gasoline blends. It also produces and sells distillates, residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil, and propane to wholesalers, retailers, and commercial customers in the New England states, Mid-Atlantic region and New York.

This is a timely way to fight inflation — buy companies that are clearly benefiting from higher oil and gas prices to consumers. Moreover, the stock pays a quarterly dividend of 60 cents (recently raised by 1 cent in the last two quarters). That puts its annual run rate at $2.40 per share. So, at Wednesday’s closing price of $23.88, the annual yield is 10%.

That clearly beats the present 8.6% CPI inflation rate. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is low at just 7x, according to Seeking Alpha. Even if earnings fall next year with a lower oil and gas price, this still makes the stock cheap.

Billcliff said the company has reached $4 million in revenue. He credits a colorful background and an entrepreneur’s drive with his success. One of the keys, he believes, is hiring the right people.

“We hire passionate artisans to do our work and that shows with the response from our clients and our growth,” Billcliff said.

Despite the economic outlook, he said one of the major renovations that should not be ignored is your roof.

Billcliff said don’t wait until a roof leaks to fix it. Taking preventative action can save you  from a more expensive repair. Go into your attic to look for any sign of leaking. Getting on the roof and looking for loose shingles is a good idea.

Sometimes a leak can be fixed without a major repair. Adding flashing or cleaning out gutters is something Merrimack sees regularly. In the area there was a shortage of reliable help the past few years, Merrimack Valley Roofing and Gutter established itself as a reliable provider that didn’t take advantage with overpriced bids.

“We want to treat everyone fairly,” Billcliff said.

Billcliff is also the owner of The Bear Cave, one of the largest bars in New England as well as Drive Again Motors and Mitty’s Big Beef. He is also a musician and an officer in a local musicians union.

Gradually with sound investments, savings, and timely decisions, he built his way up and made his mark as a successful entrepreneur. He owns, manages, and oversees over 16 business ventures that he’s either created, acquired, or initiated.

He was a founding member of the Rebels and Rockers motorcycle club. He is also the President and founding member of Braap Pack, an off-road club. One of his key achievements is being the youngest artist to have won the gold key award at the Halifax Art Festival. He had a full scholarship to the New England Art Academy and has also held an exhibition at the Daytona Art Museum.

Moreover, he is a former national wrestler, probably not surprising considering the sheer energy, passion, and hunger for achieving more than that he possesses. He is also a full-credit press associate and daredevil adventurist who has performed and filmed several stunts around the globe.

In addition, Barry has performed, filmed, and published an enormous number of daredevil stunts and adventures around the world. He was once chased to the Colosseum by a tour guide dressed as a gladiator. He climbed the great pyramid of Giza and broke into a poppy field where he was held at gunpoint by the Mexican drug cartel.

Merrimack Valley Roofing and Gutter was founded in 1976 in Southern New Hampshire.  They work with a variety of projects including Mansard, Saltbox, or Flat Roof. They are also a leading distributor of gutters in the New Hampshire region.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2472484/0/en/Merrimack-Valley-Roofing-and-Gutter-Celebrates-Revenue-Mark-With-Expansion.html,[]

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:00:02+00:00,Here’s When You Should Skip Costco and Shop at the Dollar Store,"Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com

There’s no denying the value warehouse stores such as Costco have for American consumers. After all, where else can you spend a day getting your tires changed, enjoying a cheap lunch, shopping for groceries for the month and filling your prescriptions?

Check Out: 7 Secret Money Traps at Walmart
More: 20 Best Places To Live on Only a Social Security Check

And while Costco has unbeatable prices on many items, that doesn’t mean everything you buy will save you money. Bulk packaging is the trademark of warehouse stores, and do you really need — or have room to store — a dozen cans of green beans and 30 rolls of toilet paper? And unlike toilet paper, which has an infinite shelf life, some Costco items won’t last forever, and you could wind up throwing out half of what you bought. Or more. And where’s the savings in that?

That’s why it’s worth a stroll down the aisles of your local dollar store to check the prices and availability of what you need before plopping down big money for a big package. Even though Dollar Tree raised its prices from $1 to $1.25 on many items to offset increases in shipping and other costs, shopping at dollar stores can still provide consumers with the most bang for their buck on some things.

As you prepare your shipping list, here are six things you’re probably better off buying at the dollar store instead of at Costco.

Glassware

“Dollar Tree has a ton of different specialty glassware, whereas at Costco you’ll have a seriously limited selection and you’ll have to pay more,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com said. “For instance, a margarita glass at Dollar Tree is $1.25, which means you can buy six for around $7.50; meanwhile, if you want a set of margarita glasses at Costco, you’ll end up paying around $24 or so for six of them. Even a 12-piece plastic tumbler set at Costco is around $25, but at Dollar Tree you can snag each one for $1.25, which works out to about $15 for a whole “set.”

Story continues

Spices and Seasonings

How many old jars of spices and seasonings do you have in your kitchen cabinet, and how long have you had them? Maybe so long that you moved them from your first apartment to your forever home – and maybe they’ve lost their kick by now. When recipes only call for a half-teaspoon or a pinch, it could take a very long time to use the contents.

McCormick, a well-known manufacturer of spices and seasonings, says on its website that dried seasonings, herbs and spices in jars will last about one to two years. Herbs such as oregano and seasoning blends will add flavor for one to three years, and ground spices in the jar could be good for two to four years.

POLL: Are You Concerned That Social Security Benefits Will Be Reduced During Your Lifetime?

That’s where your local dollar store helps. Throw out all the old ones and start fresh. Unless you’re feeding an army – literally – the Costco spices and seasonings likely will have a good portion remaining before their shelf life runs out. Dollar Tree sells a 6.52-ounce jar of garlic salt and 4.65 ounces of lemon pepper. Their McCormick counterparts at Costco? The 41.25-ounce container of garlic salt costs $5.29, while 28 ounces of lemon pepper sells for $10.49.

Dinnerware

“If you like to mix up your styles of dinnerware, Dollar Tree is most definitely where to go. Costco has more than a few sets, but they’re going to cost you — think 16 pieces for around $40 or more,” Ramhold said. “At Dollar Tree, each piece is $1.25 each, which means you can put together your own 16-piece set for around $20. Even the 12-piece melamine sets at Costco are more expensive per piece than what you’ll pay at Dollar Tree — it’s about $2.75 per piece, whereas Dollar Tree once again will have pieces for $1.25 each.”

Party Goods

Whether you’re throwing a birthday party for your 5-year-old or a sophisticated cocktail party, you can turn to the dollar store for many of your tableware needs.

With little ones, you’ll inevitably have spills and messy faces, so you’ll need plenty of napkins. But as with most Costco items, napkins come in large quantities. Really large quantities. A 2,000-count package of Marathon napkins costs $12.49 – way more than you’ll need for your party. Dollar Tree sells 20-count packages of dinner napkins and 30-count beverage napkins, and they come in festive colors, unlike the white napkins at Costco. The light blue napkins – along with the matching 48-count package of plastic silverware – will fit your “Frozen”-themed party just fine.

While you’re in the party aisle, you also can pick up some inexpensive decorations and single-use plastic tablecloths to help protect your furniture. You don’t want to cry over spilled milk, do you?

Mixing Bowls

“Especially if you’re using bowls for crafting purposes and not making foods, you can’t beat $1.25 for plastic bowls with handles at Dollar Tree,” Ramhold said. “A set of four melamine bowls with lids is about $20 at Costco, but different mixing bowls at Dollar Tree are only $1.25 each. You can even get two-packs of plastic bowls without handles for $1.25, which is an even better deal. And the dollar store also has stainless steel bowls in assorted sizes, which are $1.25 each; at Costco, a three-piece set of stainless steel mixing bowls is about $15, or $5 each. Dollar Tree has a fair amount of other kinds of mixing and prep bowls too, including glass prep bowl sets, which you likely won’t find at Costco — at least not all the time.”

Coffee

If you can’t get going in the morning without your coffee, you’ve probably already figured out you should skip the drive-thru of the local shop and brew your own. And while it’s convenient to have the 40-ounce bag of Kirkland Signature Medium Roast on hand ($14.99 per package), is it really the best buy? Probably not, unless you’re brewing enough for a large group of coffee drinkers at the office.

Martha Stewart’s website reports that, according to the National Coffee Association, ground coffee begins to lose its flavor about one week after its sealed container is open if it’s a dark roast, or after two weeks for other roasts. In fact, the association recommends buying smaller quantities of coffee more often.

Instead, Dollar Tree sells 6-ounce bags of ground coffee – the perfect size for a fresh brew at home. And 40 ounces of dollar store coffee is about half the price of Kirkland coffee.

Remember when you go to Costco next time that sometimes, good things do come in small packages.

Following completion of the capital increase through the conversion of the Negma convertible bonds the total number of shares issued by Oxurion amounts to 49,821,189 outstanding ordinary shares carrying voting rights (compared to 48,604,973 outstanding ordinary shares previously).

Within that framework, the cash covenant has been reduced from EUR 4 million to EUR 3 million and the interest-only period has been extended until the end of the third quarter of 2022. The reimbursement reduces the total number of shares to be issued upon a potential conversion of the Kreos/Pontifax Convertible Bonds by 1,034,482 shares without impacting the cash runway included in the Company’s Prospectus issued in March 2022.

AAPL,2022-06-30T18:00:00+00:00,Keysight’s Participation in O-RAN Global PlugFest Spring 2022 Enables Ecosystem to Speed Open RAN Technology Development and Specifications Maturity,"Comprehensive portfolio used to verify conformance, interoperability, performance, security and demonstrated innovative proof of concepts such as energy savings and AI/ML assisted optimization

SANTA ROSA, Calif., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: KEYS), a leading technology company that delivers advanced design and validation solutions to help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, participated in the fourth global PlugFest event organized by the O-RAN ALLIANCE, accelerating development of Open RAN (O-RAN) technologies with open standard interfaces, intelligence and security.

Keysight Open RAN Architect (KORA) solution portfolio enabled 15 vendors, 4 mobile operators and 2 Open Testing and Integration Centers (OTIC) at 3 PlugFest venues and 5 labs across Asia, Europe and North America to verify integration of multi-vendor network functions and compliance to O-RAN specifications.

Keysight collaborated with leading vendors and mobile operators on industry first demonstrations in key areas of innovation including:

Evaluation and assessment of energy savings features using live networks traffic profiles which have shown significant reduction in energy consumption for a multi-vendors cloud-native O-RAN system. Enablement of RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) assisted artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) optimization for energy savings and admission control use cases, as well as an orchestration framework that supports rapid deployment of test and validation for near-real time RICs and xApps. Pre-certification testing of the O-RAN Radio Unit (O-RU), automated security testing for DevSecOps with 3GPP Security Assurance Specification (SCAS) test cases, Denial of Service (DoS) and fuzzing attacks simulations and performance testing of O-RAN Xhaul transport network elements’ fronthaul implementation under real-world conditions.

""Keysight is pleased to collaborate with partners in the fourth O-RAN Global PlugFest during which we have successfully completed several industry-first demonstrations in key areas including energy savings, RIC-enabled AI/ML based optimization, test automation framework for RICs and applications, pre-certification testing, DevSecOps security with attacks simulation and transport network elements performance testing,"" said Giampaolo Tardioli, vice president and general manager of Keysight’s Network and Operators group.

Story continues

Fourteen Keysight solutions were used to make progress in the development of technical and test specifications for open standard interfaces, Xhaul transportation, O-Cloud, RIC, and AI/ML that enabled use cases and O-RAN security requirements. Keysight worked with the global PlugFest hosts, sponsors and labs in:

Europe with Telefonica (European OTIC in Madrid) Taiwan with Auray Technology Corp. (OTIC in Taiwan) United States with AT&T and DISH (co-sponsors) in the COSMOS Testbed sandbox at WINLAB, Rutgers University, POWDER Platform at the University of Utah and University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory

PlugFest participants seamlessly integrated KORA software and hardware platforms to test the following:

O-RAN Energy Savings - Keysight’s O-RAN Energy Savings test solution was used to demonstrate reduction in power consumption for a multi-vendors O-RAN system that includes containerized O-DU and O-CU software, O-Cloud software and hardware including state of the art processors with telemetry and power management features and accelerators using live network traffic profiles. Collaborators: Intel, Radisys, Vodafone and Wind River

This test solution consists of O-RU emulator with embedded UEE capabilities (RuSIM), core emulator (CoreSIM) and test automation framework (PathWave Test Automation) for stateful emulation of the network digital twin to test the O-RAN system.

(NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company, and part of The IBERDROLA Group, today announced it has signed on to the United Nations Global Compact Sustainable Ocean Principles, affirming its commitment to advancing sustainable and responsible ocean energy projects that accelerate the transformation to a cleaner and more resilient energy system. The framework, which was also signed by IBERDROLA and over 150 international businesses across various industry sectors, outlines responsible business practices for ocean activities and processes, including the development of offshore wind power.

""As we pioneer the offshore wind industry in the United States, AVANGRID is proud to join IBERDROLA and stand with the international community to reinforce our ongoing commitment to protect and preserve our ocean resources,"" said Pedro Azagra, CEO of AVANGRID. ""Through every stage of the development process, we have worked diligently to ensure that these historic offshore wind projects are built in an environmentally responsible manner that safeguards critical ecosystems and marine life, and in committing to this framework our company renews our promise to uphold these fundamental values.""

In signing the Sustainable Ocean Principles, AVANGRID commits to ensuring that material ocean-related risks and opportunities are integrated into its corporate strategy, risk management and reporting, and to taking action to promote the well-being of the ocean for current and future generations. The nine principles outline specific actions to safeguard Ocean Health and Productivity, ensure responsible Governance and Engagement, and promote Data Sharing and Transparency.

In January 2022, AVANGRID announced the completion of the restructuring of its existing Vineyard Wind joint venture to become the largest offshore wind supplier in New England. In total, AVANGRID has a projected offshore wind pipeline of 5 Gigawatts (GW) on the East Coast of the United States – enough to power more than two million households. In addition to its 50% stake in the first-in-the-nation Vineyard Wind 1 project (800 MW total), AVANGRID owns 100% of Commonwealth Wind (1200 MW to Massachusetts), Park City Wind (804 MW to Connecticut) and Kitty Hawk Wind (2500 MW off the coast of North Carolina).

The United Nations Global Compact has identified the development of clean renewable offshore energy such as offshore wind as a foundation of the societal transition toward a lower carbon future and a reduction in ocean and atmospheric pollution.

Building on its commitment to the Sustainable Ocean Principles, AVANGRID is attending the 2022 U.N. Ocean Conference, which seeks to propel much needed science-based innovative solutions aimed at starting a new chapter of global ocean action. Jay Borkland, AVANGRID’s Director of U.S. Ports & Supply Chain and an internationally-recognized expert on offshore wind port development, is participating in several panel discussions focused on infrastructure, decarbonization, and ocean-based climate solutions.

In November 2021, AVANGRID committed to United Nations (UN) Global Compact, the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. In making this commitment, AVANGRID joined thousands of other companies from around the world in demonstrating its support for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices focused on a clean and just energy transition.

(NYSE: AGR) is a leading sustainable energy company transitioning America toward a clean and connected future headquartered in Orange, CT, and has a footprint in 24 states with $40 billion in assets.

TORONTO, June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LifeWorks, a leading provider of digital and in-person total wellbeing solutions, presented its newest offering at the Corporate Knights 2022 Corporate Citizens Gala, an event honouring Canada’s top corporate citizens.

LifeWorks president and chief executive officer, Stephen Liptrap, spoke at the Corporate Knights 2022 Corporate Citizens Gala yesterday evening. The Gala recognizes Canada’s Best 50 corporate citizens based on an assessment of nearly 7,000 public companies with revenue over US$1 billion.

While congratulating this elite group, Mr. Liptrap highlighted workplace mental health as critical and increasingly important to corporate responsibility, as well business performance.

We now know that such inattention has dire long-term consequences. We have also seen that doing the right things for both people and the planet is aligned with better business performance. In our people powered economy, an organization’s actions and investments in the mental health of their people will increasingly be a differentiator of the same or great weight, and their actions relate to the environment. We recognized that organizations needed evidence-based guidance in this area, which is why we invested in the development of the LifeWorks Workplace Strategy Index for Mental Health.""

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:53:05+00:00,"Walgreens Boots (WBA) Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Miss","Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. WBA reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 96 cents in third-quarter fiscal 2022, down 36.4% year over year (down 28.9% at constant exchange rate or CER). The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.

GAAP EPS from continuing operations for third-quarter fiscal 2022 was 33 cents compared with the year-ago quarter’s $1.27. The metric plunged 74% year over year.

Total Sales

Walgreens Boots recorded total sales of $32.59 billion for the fiscal third quarter, down 4.2% year over year and 2.8% at CER. The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.

Quarterly Details

During its Q1 fiscal 2022 earnings call, Walgreens Boots’ announced the formation of a new operating segment, Walgreens Health, in line with the introduction of its new consumer-centric healthcare strategy. Given the announcement, the company divided its business into three reportable segments—the United States, International and Walgreens Health—at the start of the fiscal year.

United States

The segment’s sales totaled $26.69 billion for the fiscal third quarter, representing a decline of 7.1% year over year.

Comparable sales increased 1.8% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a 2% increase in comparable pharmacy sales and a 1.4% rise in comparable retail sales.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote

In comparable stores, total prescriptions filled decreased 2.5% from the year-ago quarter, including immunizations adjusted to 30-day equivalents.

Pharmacy sales were down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by an 11-basis points (bps) headwind from the AllianceRx Walgreens business.

Retail sales increased 1% and comparable retail sales grew 1.4% year over year. Comparable retail sales (excluding tobacco and e-cigarettes) also increased 2.4% from the prior-year quarter.

Story continues

Health and wellness sales increased 7.9%, backed by at-home COVID-19 tests and cough cold flu.

Personal care increased 2.6%, partially offset by beauty and consumables and general merchandise, which fell 0.4% and 1.9%, respectively.

International

Revenues at the International division rose 0.3% on a year-over-year basis and 9.3% at CER to $5.31 billion for the fiscal third quarter.

Boots UK sales rose 13.5% year over year. The Germany wholesale business sales increased 6.8% in the fiscal third quarter.

Boots UK’s comparable retail sales increased 24%, driven by market share gains across all categories, led by beauty.

However, Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales declined 0.4% year over year, as growth in comparable National Health Service (NHS) volumes was more than offset by favorable timing on NHS reimbursement in the year-ago quarter.

Walgreens Health

The Walgreens Health segment reported fiscal third-quarter revenues of $596 million.

Within the segment, the Shields business rose 47% on a pro forma basis versus their standalone results in the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by key contract wins, continued partnership growth and a strong focus on execution. Meanwhile, VillageMD increased 69% owing to existing clinic growth and footprint expansion.

Margins

Gross profit for the reported quarter fell 8.1% year over year to $6.57 billion. Gross margin contracted 86 bps to 20.2%.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 14.8% year over year to $7.02 billion.

The company reported an adjusted operating loss of $447 million in the quarter under review.

Financial Condition

Walgreens Boots exited the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.29 billion compared with $1.89 billion recorded at the fiscal second-quarter end. Total debt was $13.46 billion at the fiscal third-quarter end, up from $13.31 billion at the second-quarter fiscal 2022 end.

Net cash provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2022 was $3.81 billion, down from the year-ago period’s $4.31 billion.

The company has a 5-year annualized dividend growth rate of 4.7%.

Fiscal 2022 Guidance

The company has maintained the full-year adjusted EPS guidance to low-single-digit growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $5.06.

Our Take

Walgreens Boots exited third-quarter fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The Boots business continued its rally in the fiscal third quarter, with robust sales growth across the Boots UK and Boots.com. The company witnessed increased online growth momentum, with digital sales up 25% in the United States. Further, sales contributions from the newly-formed Walgreens Health segment instill investors’ optimism.

Walgreens Boots also played a significant role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 4.7 million vaccinations and 3.9 million tests in the reported quarter and more than 16 million boosters to date. The rollout of VillageMD continued to progress well in the fiscal third quarter. VillageMD had 315 total clinics open by quarter-end, indicating an increase of 97 clinics from the year-ago period.

Walgreens Boots’ fiscal third-quarter revenues fell shy of estimates and declined year over year. The top-line performance was affected by a sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens. Contraction of gross margin does not bode well. The company also reported an operating loss in the quarter, raising apprehension.

Zacks Rank and Key Picks

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:52:52+00:00,Credit Suisse Reasons Why It Remains Bullish On Paychex Despite Selloff Post Q4 Beat,"Credit Suisse analyst Kevin Mcveigh maintained Paychex, Inc (NASDAQ: PAYX) with an Outperform and cut the price target from $165 to $140. While his view remains overly bullish, he recognizes that the -4% selloff in the PAYX stock was likely due to macroeconomic uncertainty impacting the relative market amid decelerating growth, mainly due to tougher comparisons. The selloff occurred despite the F4Q beat and FY23E above expectations amid retention at structurally higher levels. Paychex introduced FY23 including +7-8% Y/Y revenue fueling 9-10% adj. EPS amid 40-41% adj. EBIT margin. The results reinforce his recent HCM software thesis that the market consistently underappreciates the current addressable market and growth. Paychex is poised to benefit from higher rates as client funds are above 2007-08. Interest income is currently lower, but higher Fed funds rate expectations of 3.5% by the end of the year, as per Credit Suisse, offers potential upside. As a reminder, he estimates every 25bps increase in rates would add about $0.01/share. Price Action: PAYX shares traded higher by 0.77% at $115.73 on the last check Thursday.

(“Three Valley Copper” or the “Company”) announced today that its 2022 annual general and special meeting of shareholders (the “Meeting”) concluded without a quorum after being adjourned from the original meeting date of June 22, 2022. In addition, immediately after the Meeting, Messrs. Liu and Smith resigned from the Board of Directors (the “Board”) reflecting the intended result of the Meeting should quorum had been met, as set out in the Company’s management information circular dated May 20, 2022 (the “Meeting Information Circular”).

At the time the Meeting was continued earlier today, proxies had been submitted by shareholders representing approximately 21.5% of the Company’s common shares outstanding and entitled to vote, which did not constitute the requisite 25% quorum. As a result, all matters set out in the Meeting Information Circular of the Company could not be acted upon. Given the minimal number of proxies received since the date of the originally scheduled Meeting on June 22, 2022, the Board did not believe a further adjournment of the Meeting would be sufficient to reach the quorum requisite for the Meeting. As such, the Meeting was cancelled and not adjourned until a later date. The Company will call another shareholders’ meeting to elect directors, appoint its auditor, amend the by-laws related to quorum for shareholders’ meetings and conduct other special business, if any, in due course.

As a result of not meeting quorum for the Meeting, the current slate of directors continues as does the auditor of the Company. The Meeting Information Circular contemplated Messrs. Liu and Smith not standing for re-election and in support of this, Messrs. Liu and Smith today stepped down from the Board reflecting the intent of the Board composition as outlined in the Meeting Information Circular.

“On behalf of our Board and TVC’s management team, we thank David and Bo for their outstanding service and commitment to the Company,” stated Terry Lyons, Chairman of the Board. “We greatly appreciate the leadership, insight and expertise that each of David and Bo provided over the last several years and wish them well in their future endeavors.”

Dental Scalers Market: Key Insights – Future Trends
Technological advances have led to the development of ultrasonic scalers. This tool relies on low-frequency soundwaves to vibrate against your teeth, effectively removing difficult tartar buildup. There are two types of ultrasonic scalers. The magnetostrictive model operates at ~25,000-30,000 cycles per second, the head moving in a circular motion. The piezoelectric scaler moves at 28,000-36,000 cycles per second while the tip vibrates back and forth against the tooth. Ultrasonic scalers ensure excellent stain removal compared to hand scaling, are more effective at removing tartar buildup than a manual scraper, and require less water during dental scaling. All these benefits of ultrasonic dental scalers propel the dental scalers market growth.

In North America, the US holds a significant share of the dental scalers market. The market growth in the US is due to the availability of most foreign companies in the healthcare sector that have their R&D centers in the US. Since these facilities rely on dental scalers to provide high-quality outcomes, this industry is projected to proliferate. Moreover, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 84.9% of children aged from 2 to 17, 64.0% of adults aged 18-64, and 65.6% of adults aged 65 and above had at least one dental visit in 2018. In a study published in the American Dental Association, scaling and root preparation are helpful for patients with chronic periodontitis. Recurrent periodontitis affects 47.2% of adults over age 30 in the US. Two main factors influencing the demand for general oral care are the prevalence of oral diseases and abnormalities in the population.

Dental Scalers Market: Segmental Overview
Based on end user, the dental scalers market is segmented into hospitals, dental clinics, and others. In 2022, the hospitals segment held the largest share of the market. However, the dental clinics segment is expected to witness the highest CAGR from 2022 to 2028. Many dental patients visit private practice dental clinics due to the availability of specialists. Over 80% of the dental practices or dental clinics are run by the owners. The number of independent practices and dental clinics is rising globally. People prefer to visit dental clinics rather than hospitals for dental treatment as they are cost-efficient. The growing number of dental clinics in rural areas of developing and developed countries is driving the growth of the dental clinics segment, hence driving the overall growth of the dental scalers market.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:47:26+00:00,Delta Air CEO apologizes for flight disruptions,"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian on Thursday apologized for flight cancellations that have hit summer plans for many travelers, adding that it would take some time for disruptions to subside.

The airline has canceled over 400 flights since Monday, as per flight-tracking website Flightaware.com, amid bad weather and an industry-wide staff shortage that has not spared even the U.S. aviation regulator.

""If you've encountered delays and cancellations recently, I apologize,"" Bastian said in a LinkedIn post. (https://bit.ly/3a2qtLA)

""Things won't change overnight, but we're on a path towards a steady recovery."" he added.

Delta has flown over 96% of its scheduled departures in June, Bastian said, as the airline works to speed up hiring. The company has recruited 15,000 new employees since the beginning of 2021.

Bastian said the company is continuing to speak with the Federal Aviation Administration to improve air traffic management.

""The environment we're navigating today is unlike anything we've ever faced,"" Bastian said.

Persistent staffing shortages, fewer flights and booming demand have cast a shadow on the busy July Fourth holiday weekend and the entire summer travel season.

Analysts and some industry executives don't see a meaningful improvement in conditions before fall, when travel demand tends to slow down.

Shares of Delta were down about 1.8% in afternoon trade.

(NOTV) Investors and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm Before August 22, 2022","NEW YORK, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on behalf of those who acquired Inotiv, Inc. (“Inotiv”) (NASDAQ: NOTV) securities from September 21, 2021 through June 13, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until August 22, 2022 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Inotiv is a contract research organization which provides nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services and research models and related products and services.

On November 5, 2021, Inotiv completed the acquisition of Envigo RMS, LLC (“Envigo”) which is now a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Inotiv.

On May 20, 2022, Inotiv filed with the SEC a current report on Form 8-K which announced the search and seizure at Inotiv’s Cumberland, Virginia facility (the “Cumberland Facility”) and the subsequent DOJ Complaint alleging violations of the Animal Welfare Act (“AWA”). On this news, the price of Inotiv shares declined by $5.19 per share, or approximately 28.31%, from $18.33 per share to close at $13.14 per share on May 23, 2022.

On June 13, 2022, Inotiv issued a press release entitled “Inotiv, Inc. Announces Site Closures and Consolidation Plans” which announced the closure of two Envigo facilities mere months after the acquisition. On this news, the price of Inotiv shares declined by $0.25 per share, or approximately 1.92%, from $13.03 per share to close at $12.78 per share on June 14, 2022.

The lawsuit alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Envigo and Inotiv’s Cumberland Facility engaged in widespread and flagrant violations of the AWA; (2) Envigo and Inotiv’s Cumberland Facility continuously violated the AWA; (3) Envigo and Inotiv did not properly remedy issues with regards to animal welfare at the Cumberland Facility; (4) as a result, Inotiv was likely to face increased scrutiny and governmental action; (5) Inotiv would imminently shut down two facilities, including the Cumberland Facility; (6) Inotiv did not engage in proper due diligence; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Inotiv securities, have information, or would like to learn more about these claims, please contact Thomas W. Elrod of Kirby McInerney LLP by email at investigations@kmllp.com, or by filling out this contact form, to discuss your rights or interests with respect to these matters without any cost to you.

(Reuters) -Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc is bracing for a leaner second half of the year, as it copes with macroeconomic pressures and data privacy hits to its ads business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The company must ""prioritize more ruthlessly"" and ""operate leaner, meaner, better executing teams,"" Chief Product Officer Chris Cox wrote in the memo, which appeared on the company's internal discussion forum Workplace.

""I have to underscore that we are in serious times here and the headwinds are fierce. We need to execute flawlessly in an environment of slower growth, where teams should not expect vast influxes of new engineers and budgets,"" Cox wrote.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The memo is the latest rough forecast to come from Meta executives, who already moved to trim costs and pause hiring across much of the company this year in the face of slowing ad sales and user growth.

Tech companies across the board have scaled back their ambitions in anticipation of a possible U.S. recession, although the slide in stock price at Meta has been more severe than at competitors Apple and Google.

The world's biggest social media company lost about half its market value this year, after Meta reported that daily active users on its flagship Facebook app had experienced a quarterly decline for the first time.

Its austerity drive comes at a tricky time, coinciding with two major strategic pivots: one aimed at re-fashioning its social media products around ""discovery"" to beat back competition from short-video app TikTok, the other an expensive long-term bet on augmented and virtual reality technology.

In his memo, Cox said Meta would need to increase fivefold the number of graphic processing units (GPUs) in its data centers by the end of the year to support the ""discovery"" push, which requires extra computing power for artificial intelligence to surface popular posts from across Facebook and Instagram in users' feeds.

Story continues

Interest in Meta's TikTok-style short video product Reels was growing quickly, said Cox, with users doubling the amount of time they were spending on Reels year over year, both in the United States and globally.

Some 80% of the growth since March came from Facebook, he added.

That user engagement with Reels could provide a key route to bolster the bottom line, making it important to boost ads in Reels ""as quickly as possible,"" he added.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in April that executives viewed Reels as ""a major part of the discovery engine vision,"" but at the time described the short video shift as a ""short-term headwind"" that would increase revenue gradually as advertisers became more comfortable with the format.

Cox said Meta also saw possibilities for revenue growth in business messaging and in-app shopping tools, the latter of which, he added, could ""mitigate signal loss"" created by Apple-led privacy changes.

He said the company's hardware division was ""laser-focused"" on successfully launching its mixed-reality headset, code-named ""Cambria,"" in the second half of the year. Meta was also focused on linking accounts across its virtual reality products and traditional social media apps, he said.

Zuckerberg will share more on the company's priorities and outlook at the company's next Q&A, he said. The weekly session is set to take place on Thursday.

""Liquidity is now our top concern after the company burned over $500 million in 1Q,"" BofA Analyst Jason Haas stated in a note titled: ""BBBY’s liquidity circles the drain.""

On Wednesday, Bed Bath & Beyond announced a loss of $224 million for its adjusted operating profits. The retailer ended the quarter with a worrisome $107 million in cash.

""As of the end of 1Q, Bed Bath & Beyond has a $100 million cash balance and $700 million available on its [credit] revolver,"" Haas explained. ""The company drew an additional $200 million on its revolver post quarter end. We're modeling $200 million of cash burn in 2Q, $100 million cash burn in 3Q and a $200 million inflow in 4Q assuming Bed Bath & Beyond can work down its inventory levels as planned post-holidays.""

BBBY stock fell more than 23% on Wednesday and remained negative on Thursday.

The stock, which more than tripled during the meme trading craze of late 2020 and early 2021, is down over 80% from highs reached in early '21.

Bed Bath & Beyond also reported that it saw same-store sales crash 27% at its namesake brand in the most recent quarter as shoppers pulled back on discretionary purchases. Shoppers also continued to shun the retailer's move to scale back coupons.

BofA's Haas concluded that Bed Bath & Beyond is now in a very precarious position financially, especially if vendors tighten credit terms as they fear not getting paid for merchandise. The dire situation is not unlike the one that ultimately sent Sears into the grave several years ago.

""That said,"" Haas added, ""we're cautious that vendors could start to reduce payable terms. If these are cut from 60 to 30 days, it would imply a cash outflow of $400 million which would put Bed Bath & Beyond in a very difficult liquidity situation, in our view.""

Along with the dismal results, Bed Bath & Beyond announced CEO Mark Tritton is leaving the company and the board, effective immediately. Tritton had joined Bed Bath & Beyond in 2019 after a successful stint at Target.

Board member and retail veteran Sue Gove is taking over the retailer on an interim basis. Bed Bath & Beyond declined to make Gove available to Yahoo Finance for an interview.

Others analysts on Wall Street echo Haas' views on the company and don't believe a change in leadership matters at this point.

""We are looking at a situation in which this company is probably not going to be around,"" Loop Capital Analyst Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""It’s not going to take years. We could be talking about months at this point. We are in the end days. These results were a dumpster fire. There is no other way to put it.""

With the rise in bond yields mostly priced in, the market is on track to pare its 9.25% year-to-date loss, they say. State and local government finances are also looking healthy, which adds to the rosy sentiment.

Large money managers including BlackRock Inc. to Nuveen LLC have become positive on municipal debt recently. Many say munis have suffered from an overreaction by investors, who pulled out a record $87 billion from muni funds, spooked by inflation and aggressive action by the Federal Reserve to contain prices by raising interest rates.

The market posted a record loss for the first six months of the year, with 10-year and 30-year AAA municipal bond yields rising about 170 basis points. Munis could finish the year down 6.25% to 7.25%, according to Barclays Plc and Charles Schwab strategists.

“We’re not going to be able climb our way out of this hole, but we’re setting ourselves up for a pretty good Q4 and 2023”, said Mikhail Foux, head of municipal strategy at Barclays. “The focus is clearly shifting away from inflation to possible recession or at least slower growth. That should put some kind of cap on how high rates will go.”

Investors have bolted from munis even though state coffers are filled with federal stimulus cash as well as personal and corporate income tax receipts. State tax revenue is 25% above its pre-pandemic peak, according to Nuveen, and state rainy day funds are at historic highs, S&P Global Ratings Inc. says.

“The story is that credit quality is very strong,” said Cooper Howard, muni fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab.

Story continues

A looming recession doesn’t dampen the view. State and local governments have historically performed relatively well during the early parts of recession, even though it has taken them much longer to eventually recover from one, according to Barclays. Some 37 states are already planning to maintain or increase their rainy day fund balances next year to brace for a slowdown, the latest quarterly fiscal survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers, shows.

With recession risk rising, Charles Schwab’s Howard recommends higher-rated AA and AAA bonds. The yield premium on AA bonds has widened to 17 basis points from seven basis points since the beginning of the year, according to Bloomberg indexes.

Investors should also consider longer-duration bonds because the yield premium is higher, Howard said. The difference in yield between 10-year AAA rated debt and 2-year bonds is 80 basis points.

“Now that we believe that the peak in yields is likely behind us, it makes sense to extend duration,” he said.

But investors should still brace for a “choppy” summer in the short term, Barclays’ Foux said. June’s inflation reading and the Fed’s July meeting, along with the end of its bond-buying program, could result in higher yields and make munis cheaper than Treasuries, he said.

“There’s a lot of near-term technicals that could put pressure on rates and make them volatile,” Foux said.

(Nasdaq: CPSS) (“CPS” or the “Company”) today announced that on June 28, 2022 it increased the capacity of its credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from $100 million to $200 million

Loans under the amended credit agreement will be secured by automobile receivables that CPS now holds, will originate directly, or will purchase from dealers in the future. CPS may borrow on a revolving basis through January 31, 2024, after which CPS will have the option to repay the outstanding loans in full or to allow them to amortize through January 31, 2028.

About Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.

Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. is an independent specialty finance company that provides indirect automobile financing to individuals with past credit problems, low incomes or limited credit histories. We purchase retail installment sales contracts primarily from franchised automobile dealerships secured by late model used vehicles and, to a lesser extent, new vehicles. We fund these contract purchases on a long-term basis primarily through the securitization markets and service the contracts over their lives.

Forward-looking statements in this news release include the Company's expectation that the revolving period will extend for two years, and that an amortization period may follow. The revolving credit agreement renewed on January 31, 2022 provides for both a revolving period and an amortization period to follow, but it is possible that the Company may suffer certain defaults or events of default that would terminate the revolving period or result in acceleration of maturity of the credit extended. In general, such defaults or events of default would result from losses that the Company might incur in the future. In turn, such losses might result from poor performance of receivables acquired or to be acquired by the Company, from increases in the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings, which could adversely affect the Company’s rights to collect payments from its portfolio; from changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; or from adverse economic conditions, either generally or in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:40:02+00:00,Netflix's ad rollout signals 'paradox of choice' for both brands &amp; consumers: Expert,"Netflix (NFLX) confirmed that an ad-supported tier will indeed be hitting the streaming service.

""We [are] adding an ad tier; we’re not adding ads to Netflix as you know it today. We’re adding an ad tier for folks who say, ‘Hey, I want a lower price and I’ll watch ads,'"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said at last week's Cannes Lions advertising festival.

Advertisers have praised the upcoming rollout with David Cohen, CEO of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), telling Yahoo Finance that ""this is a net benefit to the market as this will mean significantly more supply that the market can purchase.""

He added that consumers have flocked to streaming services amid the pandemic, creating even more opportunities for engagement amid the ""erosion"" of linear TV.

""There are nearly unlimited options for both consumers and marketers to connect with audiences,"" Cohen said, although he did caution ""that's a blessing and a curse.""

""There is a paradox of choice, and it's a complicated market with lots of players so it's more challenging to aggregate reach and aggregate scale,"" he explained.

Advertising isn't a cure-all and it isn't free money...Bank of America

New reports have shown the kinks when it comes to streamers and OTT platforms embracing advertising.

According to The Wall Street Journal, which cited a study by WPP PLC’s ad-buying giant GroupM and ad-measurement firm iSpot.tv Inc., many commercials continue to play on ad-supported streaming services even after viewers turn off their televisions — contributing to an estimated waste of more than $1 billion per year for brands.

But experts in the space have shrugged off any concerns, comparing it to the ""natural growing pains"" seen throughout media's history.

""It's expected,"" stated Laura Grover, head of client solutions at advertising measurement platform EDO, underscoring that ""there's this period for all media — as it evolves — where the industry is figuring out measurement.""

Netflix's 'cautious' foray into advertising  Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer and co-CEO at Netflix, gestures as he speaks during a conference at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, France, June 23, 2022. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard

Netflix is reportedly in talks with both NBCUniversal (CMCSA) and Google (GOOGL) for exclusive partnership deals to help the company create its ad tier; however, a Netflix spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the company is ""still in the early days of deciding how to launch a lower priced, ad supported option and no decisions have been made.""

Story continues

Experts say that the streamer will need to find an ad partner that ""is not only innovative in how they sell and serve ads but also understands the importance of next-gen measurement,"" EDO's Grover said.

""The right ad sales partner should understand the importance of real-time, outcome-based measurement that enables marketers and networks to see what triggers the conversion from awareness to intent,"" she continued.

'Advertising isn't a cure-all'

Wall Street, meanwhile, still needs convincing that an ad-supported tier is the answer to Netflix's problems.

According to recent data, cited in a new note by Bank of America, customers across all income levels would switch to a discounted ad-based alternative — however, ""ad-tiering could serve as a way for consumers across all income brackets to extend their streaming budget by trading down to subscribe to an additional service, benefiting Netflix's competitors much more than Netflix itself.""

The analysts warned that Netflix should enter the ad space cautiously, describing it as a costly endeavor that needs to be crafted with the consumer experience in mind.

""Advertising isn't a cure-all and it isn't free money,"" the note emphasized.

IAB's Cohen agreed, noting: ""The challenge that we have as an industry is to not go down the path that we did in the past, historically, by trying to cram too many ads and clutter the consumer experience.""

Overall, though, the executive surmised that ""the consumer experience is going to be very, very good relative to ad supported streaming in the future"" — citing the flexibility and fluidity of streaming relative to the rigidness of traditional TV.

Netflix stock, currently trading at around $180 a share, has plummeted 70% year-to-date amid a broader market sell-off that's slammed growth stocks and fueled talk of a potential recession.

The ad-supported tier, coupled with a crackdown on password sharing, should help boost revenues as the platform grapples with a post-COVID slump in subscribers.

Netflix announced an unexpected first-quarter subscriber loss of 200,000 users in April. It expects to lose another 2 million subs in the current quarter.

To offset some of that churn, the company issued another round of job cuts last week, eliminating 300 positions.

The job cuts follow Netflix's last round of layoffs in May when the streamer laid off 150 members of its workforce. In recent weeks, a number of technology companies and venture capital–backed firms have announced plans to either freeze hiring, rescind accepted offers, or lay off employees entirely.

The airline has canceled over 400 flights since Monday, as per flight-tracking website Flightaware.com, amid bad weather and an industry-wide staff shortage that has not spared even the U.S. aviation regulator.

""If you've encountered delays and cancellations recently, I apologize,"" Bastian said in a LinkedIn post. (https://bit.ly/3a2qtLA)

""Things won't change overnight, but we're on a path towards a steady recovery."" he added.

Delta has flown over 96% of its scheduled departures in June, Bastian said, as the airline works to speed up hiring. The company has recruited 15,000 new employees since the beginning of 2021.

Bastian said the company is continuing to speak with the Federal Aviation Administration to improve air traffic management.

""The environment we're navigating today is unlike anything we've ever faced,"" Bastian said.

Persistent staffing shortages, fewer flights and booming demand have cast a shadow on the busy July Fourth holiday weekend and the entire summer travel season.

Analysts and some industry executives don't see a meaningful improvement in conditions before fall, when travel demand tends to slow down.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:38:00+00:00,"Transwestern Ventures Brings State-of-the-Art Biomanufacturing Campus to Vacaville, CA","VACAVILLE, Calif., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transwestern Ventures (TWV) and the City of Vacaville together announce plans to develop a 390,000-square-foot biomanufacturing campus on 22.4 acres in Vaca Valley Business Park, located at the interchange of I-80 and I-505 in Vacaville, California. The project will be built in two phases: Phase 1 comprises 233,888 square feet with delivery estimated in Summer 2024, and Phase 2 comprises 158,316 square feet.

Part of the Bay Area, Vacaville is situated along the main thoroughfare between the state capital and the Bay Area. Its proximity to San Francisco, Sacramento, and the University of California’s Berkeley and Davis campuses provides access to top talent from across the life sciences and advanced manufacturing sectors. Additionally, Solano Community College’s Vacaville campus has distinguished itself through the offering of two biomanufacturing baccalaureate programs. Vacaville is also home to the California Biomanufacturing Center Inc., a nonprofit dedicated to accelerating biomanufacturing growth.

“Vacaville is a biomanufacturing leader in the U.S., making this area incredibly attractive to companies looking for modern facilities in a region with a critical shortage of available life sciences space,” said Fred Knapp, Managing Partner, Transwestern Ventures. “Some of the world’s leading life sciences firms have come to Vacaville to capitalize on the synergies created by a combination of extraordinary talent, relative affordability, and the city’s strong economic and demographic trends.”

Companies such as Agenus, Kaiser Permanente, Genentech, and Polaris currently have a presence in Vaca Valley Business Park. The site newly acquired by TWV was sourced by Transwestern Real Estate Services (TRS) and purchased in an off-market transaction.

The TRS Life Sciences team of Managing Director Ken Meyersieck, Senior Vice President Peter Conte, and Vice President Andrew Wheeler will oversee leasing for the new campus, which can meet occupier needs ranging from biomanufacturing and R&D space to healthcare and medical office. The buildings are suitable for a single user or may be divided.

“Vacaville works hard to appeal to both businesses and residents, and we are extremely proud of our reputation as a growing biomanufacturing corridor,” said Ron Rowlett, Mayor of the City of Vacaville. “Our city is uniquely positioned to offer life sciences firms both superior space in newly developed facilities and the quality of life a young, talented workforce expects. We are delighted to collaborate with Transwestern Ventures to bring its vision to life.”

With a population of more than 102,000, Vacaville is a vibrant city in one of the country’s fastest-growing areas. It is an attractive family community with a historic past deep in culture, and a wealth of amenities including parks, community centers, museums, public venues, attractions and events.

PLUG stock won’t likely stay at its current price much longer, and even has the potential to double or more.

As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on, nations are increasingly prioritizing energy security and independence. At the same time, consumers have had enough of high oil and gas prices, and are ready for cheaper alternatives.

If any company is ready and willing to provide cleaner fuel solutions, it’s Plug Power. Folks on Wall Street might not fully appreciate Plug Power’s progress in the U.S. and abroad, but that’s fine as it presents a chance to invest at a great price.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Ticker Company Current Price PLUG Plug Power Inc. $16.81

What’s Happening with PLUG Stock?

Not long ago, InvestorPlace contributor Tezcan Gecgil cited PLUG stock as one of five hydrogen stocks to buy before they go higher. Does Plug Power deserve to be on the list? Lately, investors don’t seem to think so. Shockingly, the share price has fallen from its 52-week high of $46.50 to less than $20.

Hopefully, traders will come to their senses and push the stock back up to the $40s again. There hasn’t been any terrible company-specific news lately. Perhaps investors are jittery about so-called growth stocks, so they sold off their Plug Power shares.

Yet, the multinational transition to clean energy sources isn’t slowing down. Plus, Plug Power is among the most ambitious hydrogen businesses. As Gecgil pointed out, Plug Power is collaborating with Olin (NYSE:OLN) to “produce and market green hydrogen to support growing fuel cell demand in the global hydrogen economy.”

Major Production in the Works

Gecgil also cited Plug Power’s first-quarter 2022 financial results, which were impressive. The company roughly doubled its revenue, from $72 million in the year-earlier quarter to $140.8 million in Q1 2022. On top of that, Plug Power reported “meaningful improvement in service margins on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure with a positive 30% [sequential] increase.”

Furthermore, Plug Power has made inroads into the green hydrogen market, both in the U.S. and the E.U. With Olin, Plug Power hopes to provide green hydrogen throughout North America. The first production plant will be located in Louisiana, and is expected to produce 15 tons of green hydrogen per day.

Meanwhile, Plug Power has also signed a 30-year agreement to build a 100-megawatt green hydrogen plant at the Belgian Port of Antwerp-Bruges. Amazingly, Plug Power expects to produce “up to 12,500 tons per year of liquid and gaseous green hydrogen for the European market” from this plant.

What You Can Do Now

It’s baffling, and maybe a bit frustrating, that PLUG stock is trading at such a steep discount now. After all, Plug Power is a powerful revenue generator. The company is also an aggressive clean hydrogen producer in multiple geographies.

However, you don’t have to be frustrated because Plug Power shares are cheap. If anything, this should be viewed as an opportunity to take a position, or add to an existing one. Soon, the stock price could reach back into the $40s, and then just keep on going.

June 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Thursday it is seeking full U.S. approval for its oral COVID-19 antiviral treatment Paxlovid, which is currently available under an emergency use authorization (EUA).

Pfizer said it submitted a New Drug Application for Paxlovid to the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19 in vaccinated and unvaccinated people at high risk of progression to severe illness.

That is basically consistent with the drug's current EUA, which Pfizer said covers 50% to 60% of the U.S. population, citing estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A full approval could mean the company would have the option to sell Paxlovid on the open market like other drugs, depending on whether or not the U.S. government decides to stop buying the drug and providing it for free nationwide.

Also, ""the company might have more control over educating the public with commercials, or however they want, to boost uptake,"" said Karen Andersen, healthcare strategist at Morningstar.

The two-drug treatment taken for five days beginning shortly after onset of COVID symptoms reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 88% in non-hospitalized, high-risk adult patients in Pfizer's clinical trial, which did not included vaccinated people.

Data from a study in Israel earlier this month showed Paxlovid reduced COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients 65 years and older, but was not found to prevent severe illness among younger adults.

More than 1.6 million courses of Paxlovid have been administered in the United States, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.

The funding was received through NRCan’s Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program (ZEVIP), which is intended to support initiatives that are helping Canada meet its net-zero by 2050 commitment.

“Together with the Government of Canada, we are making the necessary investments in EV charging infrastructure to help secure a sustainable future for Canada,” said Jonathan Sandler, President of Baseload. “The electrification of transportation is essential to ensuring that we steward our planet well, leaving it in better shape than how we found it for our future generations.”

“We are very pleased to support AURA and Baseload Power in this major deployment,” said Louis Tremblay, FLO President and CEO of FLO. “FLO’s expansion across principal locations in Canada, particularly in Ontario via the AURA network, has been key in the network’s overall growth, providing EV drivers with the service that they expect and deserve.”

AURA’s fast EV chargers are located at commercial properties including those owned by RioCan and co-owned by RioCan and KingSett Capital. “We are proud to be making this announcement at The Burlington Centre and are excited to be working with co-owners RioCan and KingSett who are both leading Canadian real estate companies that share our enthusiasm for promoting EV adoption,"" said Paul Merkur, Baseload’s Executive VP.

“As community stewards and a leader in the Canadian real estate industry, we strive to bring sustainable options to the communities in which we operate. We are excited by this significant step forward in increasing the number of EV charging stations in our portfolio,” said Oliver Harrison, RioCan’s Senior Vice President, Operations.

“This important initiative with Baseload and RioCan aligns perfectly with KingSett’s commitment to driving progress on climate change and providing our stakeholders with greater access to clean transportation charging solutions,” said Theresa Warnaar, KingSett’s Senior Vice President, Retail & Asset Resilience.

Baseload’s core focus is on developing and building electric vehicle charging, renewable energy and energy storage infrastructure. Baseload will continue to lead and invest to meet the future needs of e-mobility by expanding its AURA network across Canada.

Ex-Monero developer Ricardo “Fluffypony” Spagni will surrender on July 5 to the U.S. Marshals Service for extradition to South Africa, where he faces fraud charges, according to court documents filed Thursday.

He will depart for South Africa shortly thereafter, the documents said. South African officials will be on hand to “effectuate his arrest.”

South African officials have accused Spagni of committing $100,000 in invoice fraud against his former employer, Cape Cookies. Facing trial in early 2021, he instead fled South Africa, going on the lam in the U.S. until his capture that August in Nashville, Tenn. He’s been fighting extradition ever since.

Spagni’s lawyer didn't pick up the phone, and when reached by CoinDesk, Spagni declined to comment.

Monero (XMR) is trading at $110, down 6% in the past 24 hours amid a broader crypto sell-off.

Helstu fréttir af starfsemi:

Rekstur á fyrsta ársfjórðungi gekk vel, með 19% veltuaukningu milli ára og heildarhagnaði 27% yfir fyrra ári.Seldum stykkjum í dagvöruverslunum fjölgar milli ára og heimsóknum viðskiptavina fjölgar auk þess um rúm 10% á fjórðungnum. Magnaukning í eldsneytis­lítrum á 1F er rúm 17%. Framlegð í krónum talið eykst um 10,4% milli ára en framlegðarhlutfallið lækkar um 1,6%-stig, einkum vegna aukinnar sölu eldsneytis til stórnotenda og hækkunar á heimsmarkaðs­verði. Lengri afgreiðslutími verslana Bónus skilar áfram fjölgun viðskiptavina og aukinni sölu. Áhrif COVID-19 hafa minnkað en ýmissa hnökra gætir í framleiðslu matvöru og í aðfangakeðjunni, vegna eftirstöðva farsóttar og vegna stríðsátaka í Úkraínu – hefur leitt til hækkandi aðfangaverðs og aukið líkur á vöruskorti einstaka vöruflokka.Í mars 2022 var gengið frá samningum um kaup Haga á öllu hlutfé í Eldum rétt ehf. Kaupin eru háð samþykki SE. Í júní 2022 undirrituðu Hagar sátt við Samkeppniseftirlitið vegna kaupa félagsins á nýju hlutafé í Klasa ehf.

Finnur Oddsson, forstjóri:

Starfsemi Haga á fyrsta fjórðungi rekstrarársins 2022/23 gekk heilt yfir vel og einkenndist m.a. af áframhaldandi tekjuvexti og ágætri afkomu. Vörusala jókst um 19% miðað við sama tímabil á fyrra  ári og nam 38,2 ma. kr. EBITDA nam 2.668 m.kr. og hagnaður var 926 m.kr.

Eftirstöðvar COVID-19 og stríðsátök í Úkraínu höfðu nokkur áhrif á reksturinn og skýra hækkanir aðfangaverðs, bæði í dagvöru og eldsneyti, og tekjuvöxt að einhverju leyti. Bætta afkomu Haga á milli fjórðunga má að stórum hluta rekja til starfsemi Olís sem skilaði umtalsvert betri afkomu en í fyrra. Þar raungerist ávinningur vegna nokkurra þátta, þ.e. hagræðingar í rekstri Olís á síðustu misserum, breyttum áherslum í rekstri þjónustustöðva, fjölgun erlendra ferðamanna og mikið auknum umsvifum hjá stórnotendum, m.a. í útgerð og ferðaþjónustu. Framlegð vörusölu hjá Olís jókst í krónum talið í takti við aukið magn, en lækkar sem hlutfall af tekjum.  Helstu áhrifaþættir eru mikil hækkun á heimsmarkaðsverði olíu og umtalsverð söluaukning til stórnotenda.

Tekjur vegna sölu á dagvöru í Bónus og Hagkaup jukust um tæp 6% á fjórðungnum, seldum stykkjum fjölgaði lítillega og heimsóknum viðskiptavina töluvert. Tekjuaukningu má að hluta rekja til aukningar hjá Bónus og að hluta til hærra vöruverðs, en verð á aðföngum frá framleiðendum og birgjum hélt áfram að hækka á fjórðungnum, af fyrrgreindum ástæðum. Afkoma í dagvörusölu var svipuð á milli ára.

Vinna við breyttar áherslur í starfsemi Haga hélt áfram á fjórðungnum og gekk vel.  Þar má m.a. nefna breytingar á vörumerki Olís og umbreytingu á starfsemi smásölusviðs, einföldun á fyrirtækjasviði Olís og stofnun nýrrar rekstrareiningar, Stórkaups, í maí. Nýjar áherslur og lengri opnunartími hjá Bónus hafa einnig gefist vel, náðu til fleiri verslana og endurspeglast ágætlega í nýrri og glæsilegri verslun sem opnuð var á Akureyri í maí.  Kaup Haga á hlut í Klasa voru samþykkt af Samkeppniseftirlitinu, en kaupin eru liður í því að auka fókus stjórnenda Haga í sölu á dagvöru og eldsneyti og treysta um leið verðmætasköpun á grunni þróunareigna félagsins. Gengið var frá samningum um kaup Haga á Eldum rétt ehf., sem einkum eru hugsuð til að bregðast við breyttum neysluvenjum og aukinni áherslu á hollar og einfaldar lausnir fyrir viðskiptavini. Vinnu við stafræn verkefni miðar vel, annars vegar til að tryggja betur grunnrekstur upplýsingakerfa og hins vegar til að efla þjónustu við viðskiptavini, m.a. með áframhaldandi þróun netverslana fyrir Hagkaup og Stórkaup.

Við erum ánægð með árangur Haga á þessum fyrsta fjórðungi rekstrarársins. Heilt yfir þá gekk vel og eins og síðustu fjórðunga þá njótum við nú góðs af aðgerðum til að auka skilvirkni rekstrar. Vegna hækkandi aðfangaverðs sem meðal annars hlýst af átökum í Úkraínu er ljóst að það eru ögrandi tímar framundan í smásölu. Sem fyrr verður okkar mikilvægasta viðfangsefni að tryggja framboð á nauðsynjum og gæta sérstaklega að hagkvæmni í allri okkar starfsemi, einkum til að vega upp á móti verðhækkunum á nauðsynjum sem nú gætir bæði hérlendis og erlendis.

Nýlega uppfærð afkomuspá gerir ráð fyrir að EBITDA samstæðunnar á yfirstandandi rekstrarári verði á bilinu 10.200 – 10.700 m.kr., án áhrifa vegna viðskipta með Klasa.

Hancock said. “With the Supreme Court’s ruling today limiting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, it’s even more critical that we act now at the local level. I urge cities and leaders across the nation to join us in taking strong action on climate to protect our future and our children’s future.”

The global climate crisis is contributing to Denver’s longer and more frequent droughts, hotter temperatures and poor air quality, among other hazards. Scientists and experts agree that wealthier nations and cities must act swiftly to curb further greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and support adaptation and resilience for those most vulnerable to address the impacts we are already experiencing today.

“Two-thirds of the global population live in cities, so cities need to take action,” said Grace Rink, Denver’s chief climate officer. “Denver’s Climate Protection Fund is exceptional among local governments, and can equitably support the policy measures designed to get us to net zero by 2040.”

In 2021, CASR led or supported key climate policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, including:

Energize Denver, led by the Energize Denver Task force and implemented by Community Planning and Development and CASR to drastically cut buildings’ reliance on fossil fuels. Bring Your Own Bag, led by City Council and implemented by CASR to reduce the use of plastic bags #SkiptheStuff, led by City Council and implemented by CASR to reduce the use of single-use items when ordering takeout or delivery.

The city’s Climate Protection Fund provides approximately $40 million each year dedicated to climate action in six key areas, including Adaptation & Resiliency, Buildings & Homes, Climate & Environmental Justice, Sustainable Transportation, Renewable Energy, and Workforce Development. The CPF Five Year Plan outlined funding priorities in each of these areas. In its first year of funding, the Climate Protection Fund committed to:

$18 million in community solar, with 30 percent of the power generated helping pay bills for Denver Public Schools families with lower incomes. Nearly 1,000 paid positions in workforce development programs designed to give under-resourced residents a clear pathway to the quality, in-demand jobs of the future.

Planting more than 2,000 trees to increase tree canopy in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. A free, on-demand micro-shuttle to help Montbello residents move around their neighborhood and connect to transit. Co-creating climate and environmental justice solutions with historically underrepresented communities. Retrofitting the Forum Apartments to an all-electric building, improving the health, safety and comfort of residents experiencing homelessness.

More than half of the Climate Protection Fund’s first-year investments directly benefit Denver’s most climate-vulnerable residents, surpassing its mandate to direct 50 percent of the funds towards those communities. As of today, Denver’s most climate-vulnerable residents can immediately take advantage of:

Rebates for e-bikes and e-cargo bikes to replace car trips, covering up to 100% of the cost Rebates for energy efficient heating and cooling, covering up to 100% of the cost Free e-bike libraries for essential workers in the Westwood and Globeville, Elyria, and Swansea neighborhoods Reduced costs for solar panel installations Paid workforce training programs

Free reusable bags Funding for neighborhoods and small businesses to go green

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:26:05+00:00,Auto Market Quite Resilient Right Now: Here's Why,"Amid the bad news in the Conference Board’s consumer confidence survey for June was one line that drew my attention: “Purchasing intentions for cars, homes, and major appliances held relatively steady.”

Cars in particular still seem to be in demand. At least that is the feeling you get from commentary coming out of the major auto retailers. AutoNation AN, Group 1 Automotive GPI, Lithia Motors LAD and Penske Automotive Group PAG management have all said on their respective earnings conference calls that the greatest deterrent to higher new vehicle sales was the supply chain.

In fact, all these auto dealers have no new vehicle inventory. In Penske’s case, vehicles are sold well before they enter the lot. Group 1 and Penske management explain that this is attributable to pent-up demand as new vehicle sales have been very low in the last couple of years. So companies are seeing their order backlogs build up, some going into 2023.

Luckily for the auto retail industry, players are not limited to new vehicle sales. Most derive a larger percentage of their revenue from used vehicle sales. The used vehicle business depends on a couple of factors: first, the ability to acquire vehicles at reasonable prices and second, the ability to quickly refurbish and put back on sale.

The visible trend among the top players is to acquire directly from end users. This could reduce the acquisition cost and time to acquisition by eliminating the middle man, often the fleet owners.

AutoNation is optimistic about its ability to build used vehicle inventories because of an efficient sourcing system and its own refurbishing skills. Management says that 94% of its used vehicles are acquired directly from consumers.

Similarly, Group 1’s strategy is to acquire used vehicles through its AcceleRide digital marketplace for vehicles. In the last quarter, it recorded a nearly 300% increase in vehicle sourcing through AcceleRide. Lithia Motors uses the same strategy, acquiring through its digital platform Driveway.

Story continues

And CarShop, the online platform formed as a result of an arrangement between Penske and Cox Automotive is doing pretty much the same thing. Lithia Motors also has a dedicated online platform for energy conscious customers. Its GreenCars marketplace as it is called tells interested customers how they could acquire EVs and related goods and services.

Operating an online platform is also beneficial in other ways. Most people are used to researching online the item they are looking to buy. So this way, the dealers can pick up some advertising revenue while also hooking up their customers to the OEMs themselves. This could be an advantage in speeding up the booking process, especially when inventories are running so low.

Additionally, one of the biggest growth drivers for auto dealers in recent times has been the aftermarket. Even when sales disappoint, as they are likely to do when there’s inadequate inventory, or when people are trying to save money, the need to repair/refurbish or otherwise service whatever transportation they own becomes even more important. So, it is a kind of a hedge.

Because of all these positives, AutoNation, Group 1, Lithia Motors and Penske Automotive continue to see rising estimates. And this is translating into Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) ratings on these shares.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:25:05+00:00,SL Green (SLG) Acquires 450 Park Avenue in Joint Venture,"SL Green Realty Corp. SLG is positioning itself well to capitalize on the recovery of the New York City real estate market and leverage the capital deployment interest of international investors in the market. Recently, it announced the closing of the 450 Park Avenue acquisition in a newly formed joint venture. It marks a notable boost for SL Green’s growing investment management platform.

The ownership group comprises institutional investors from South Korea and Israel. SLG, which retained a 25.1% stake in the property, will administer the leasing and management of the property on behalf of the partnership.

450 Park Avenue is a prominent 33-story Class A tower encompassing a total of 337,000 square feet of luxury office and prime retail space. With its premium location at the corner of 57th Street and Park Avenue, the property boasts of high-end boutique financial services and luxury tenants, including Banco Bradesco, BDT Capital Partners and Oxford Properties. Also, the corner retail location will be occupied soon by Aston Martin’s first-ever Manhattan showroom.

On behalf of the ownership group, SL Green has plans for capital investments, including developing a new amenity offering, providing high-quality, tailored programs and services for building tenants.

Markedly, SL Green has a mono-market strategy focus with an enviable footprint in the large, high-barrier-to-entry New York real estate market. This, along with the ownership of premier Manhattan office assets, has enabled the company to enjoy decent occupancy across its portfolio over the years.
 
Additionally, the company aims at maintaining a diversified tenant base to hedge the risk associated with dependency on single-industry tenants. As a result, its largest tenants include renowned firms from different industries. Moreover, with long-term leases to tenants with strong credit profile, it is well-poised to generate stable rental revenues over the long term.

The U.S office real estate market continues to struggle with the aftereffects of the health crisis, with negative absorption and increasing vacancy levels. The lackluster environment can be attributed to pandemic-led job cuts and remote-working models, which have diminished office space utilization.

While a significant government stimulus and increasing vaccination coverage are likely to support job growth, a significant turnaround is less likely, specifically at older office properties that are witnessing rent declines amid the increasing tenant preference for high-quality buildings. Also, the emergence of the new variants of COVID-19 could further dampen the ongoing recovery in the office real estate market.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 36.2% over the past six months compared with the industry's fall of 19.6%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:25:05+00:00,Is It Wise to Hold Macerich (MAC) in Your Portfolio Now?,"The Macerich Company MAC has a high concentration of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. These properties are located in densely populated areas where affluent consumers with significant disposable income live and play, offering the company the solid scope to generate decent cash flows and positioning it for a strong post-pandemic rebound.

Macerich’s decent number of well-capitalized retailers in its tenant roster and a well-laddered lease maturity schedule helped it navigate through turbulent times as well as gain from a solid rebound of the retail real estate market post-pandemic.

The relaxation of government-mandated restrictions and the high levels of vaccination across the United States have resulted in a significant improvement in sales and traffic across the company’s portfolio. In the first quarter of 2022, portfolio comparable tenant sales from spaces less than 10,000 square feet were 14.5% higher year over year. Moreover, MAC’s portfolio tenant sales per square foot for spaces less than 10,000 square feet in the trailing 12 months ended Mar 31, 2022 touched $843, taking it to a record high.

Macerich has been making efforts to enhance its asset quality and customer relationships through the increasing adoption of the omnichannel model. Also, a shift toward re-use and mixed-use properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants remains a key emphasis of Macerich, while bringing brands to the new markets at its mall is likely to attract shoppers.

Macerich recently announced that Target TGT, a leading retailer, will be opening its store in Danbury Fair. The mall is located in upscale suburban Connecticut, 55 miles away from New York City. This will also mark Target’s first store in Danbury, CT. Target will open its store in the former Sears site, and it will be a 126,000-square-foot, two-level store. TGT also recently opened a three-level store at Macerich's Kings Plaza in Brooklyn at a former JCPenney location.

However, higher e-commerce adoption, shrinking traffic at its retail properties and store closures are key concerns. However, with widespread vaccination drives and relaxations being implemented, the mall traffic is witnessing a rebound. However, the recovery is expected to be slow, given the concerns regarding the emergence of the new variants of COVID-19 and more consumers learning about the convenience of online purchases. Further, the substantial asset concentration raises Macerich’s risks.

Also, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for MAC. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden and its total debt as of Mar 31, 2022 was approximately $6.9 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86%. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) firm have plunged 43.1% over the past three months compared with the industry's decline of 12.5%. Moreover, estimate revision trends for 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share do not indicate a favorable outlook for the company as estimates have remained unchanged over the past month. Given the abovementioned concerns and lack of upward estimate revisions, the stock has limited upside potential in the near term.

In light of the current rise in P2F conversions in the aviation market, Mammoth Freighters is securing its position in 777 conversions and has contracts through 2026 and beyond. In this context, Triumph Interiors will offer manufacturing and engineering services to the redesigned air distribution ducting system in the cargo compartment of the converted aircraft.

With the current deal, Triumph Interiors will complement Mammoth's unique business model by offering an expanding portfolio of industry-leading P2F solutions, including integrated hydraulic power packs for the cargo door system.

Prospects for Triumph Group

The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in travel restrictions and the grounding of aircraft worldwide, which created an opportunity for converting passenger aircraft to freighters. The massive growth in e-commerce and the movement of COVID vaccines to different regions worldwide are creating the need for more freighters.

The higher demand for freighters is going to boost the growth prospects of companies like TGI that have an established position in manufacturing complex electro-hydraulic and mechanical systems and equipment for the aerospace and defense industry.

Per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the global freighter aircraft market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of more than 4.5% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth prospects bode well for Triumph Group as it is the leading supplier of aircraft parts and services to prominent defense companies.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:19:58+00:00,U.S. Supreme Court rejects American Axle case on patent eligibility,"By Blake Brittain

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declined to hear American Axle & Manufacturing Inc's bid to revive its patent on technology for quieting driveshaft noise, turning away a case that may have clarified the circumstances under which inventions warrant a patent.

The justices rejected American Axle's appeal of a lower court ruling that invalidated the Detroit-based company's patent in a legal fight with Farmington Hills, Michigan-based rival Neapco Holdings. Critics have said court precedent on patent eligibility has produced unpredictable decisions and undermined the U.S. patent process.

President Joe Biden's administration in May urged the high court to take up the case, saying American Axle's invention was a classic example of a patent-eligible industrial process.

The Supreme Court last addressed patent eligibility in a 2014 ruling called Alice Corp v. CLS Bank International that helped establish a two-part eligibility test. The test requires courts to determine if an invention involves an unpatentable abstract idea, natural phenomenon or law of nature, and if so, whether it includes an inventive concept.

Defendants in patent-infringement cases often challenge the validity of patents to try to end these cases quickly. Detractors have said the Alice case ruling and subsequent decisions guided by it have created confusion and inconsistency that has led courts to cancel patents on inventions that should be protected.

American Axle sued Neapco in federal court in Delaware in 2015, accusing it of infringement of a patented method of manufacturing a driveshaft that vibrates less. At issue were Neapco driveshafts made for the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon pickup trucks.

After a judge in Delaware ruled in favor of Neapco, American Axle appealed to the Washington-based Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, but lost again. A three-judge Federal Circuit panel voted 2-1 to invalidate American Axle's patent after finding that it covered a simple application of Hooke's law, a physics principle.

Story continues

The Federal Circuit then decided, thanks to a 6-6 deadlock, not to rehear the case with all of its judges. Dissenting judges said the panel's decision could threaten ""most every invention for which a patent has ever been granted,"" and that the court's eligibility rulings had turned the patent system into a ""litigation gamble.""

The dispute left the Federal Circuit ""bitterly divided"" and ""at a loss"" on how to apply the law, as one of its judges put it. All 12 of the Federal Circuit's then-active judges asked the Supreme Court to hear a similarly divisive 2019 case that the high court rejected despite a recommendation by former President Donald Trump administration's to take it up.

The Supreme Court has also denied several other petitions related to patent eligibility since the Alice case.

A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office spokesperson said after the ruling that innovation ""cannot thrive in uncertainty,"" and that the office is committed to ""making every effort to ensure that the U.S. patent system is as clear and consistent as possible.""

An attorney for Neapco said the decision validates its view that the current framework for patent eligibility does not need to be overhauled.

American Axle and its lead attorney in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:15:00+00:00,Thor Equities Group Acquires Industrial Portfolio in Savannah for $48.5M,"New York, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Thor Equities Group, a global leader in urban real estate development, leasing and management, is pleased to announce the acquisition of an eleven-asset portfolio in the sought-after Savannah industrial market.

Situated on approximately 27-acres within the SPA Industrial Park, Thor’s portfolio totals 524,500 square feet and is located 5 minutes from the nearest I-95 interchange, the main distribution thoroughfare for the East coast of the United States. The assets are also ideally located less than 15 minutes from the Port of Savannah, the fourth largest port in the United States, and a 10-minute drive from the Savannah / Hilton Head International Airport. The portfolio is nearly 100% leased to tenants including S&M Transportation, Transrepublica, Pactra Logistics, CRS Inc., Thunder Logistics, and more.

“This latest investment represents our drive to expand our industrial footprint in the US, and our strategy to acquire and develop high-quality properties in top-tier infill locations. Savannah has become the dominant port for the Southeastern United States and so, this is a key addition to our platform,” said Joseph Sitt, Chairman of Thor Equities Group.

Thor broke into Georgia’s industrial market in late 2021 with the acquisition of an asset in Atlanta and plans to develop a +1M square foot state-of-the-art warehouse in nearby Adairsville. Thor Equities also owns logistics assets in the Northern New Jersey, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia markets. Abroad, Thor recently sold a collection of prime assets across Spain, France, and the Netherlands, and has been especially active building its Spanish logistics portfolio. Last month, Thor launched its latest venture, Thor Digital, a division specializing in the acquisition and development of data centers across Europe with an equity commitment of up to US$3 billion and goal of US$9 billion in acquisitions value.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:15:00+00:00,"Jon Becker, Founder of Aardvark Tactical and PROJECT7 ARMOR, Releases The Debrief, a New Conversational Podcast Centered on Tactical Leadership","LA VERNE, Calif., June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After over four decades spent serving and protecting tactical operators, Jon Becker is imparting some of the lessons he has learned along the way to listeners across the nation. The Debrief is an interview-based podcast that tells the stories of the leaders of some of the world's top law enforcement and military units - individuals who navigate dangerous situations with their highly effective teams every day.

Jon Becker founded AARDVARK at just seventeen years old. The company started out as a climbing equipment business, often selling gear to SWAT teams and operators. After attending law school and working in police litigation, Becker realized that the best way he could serve tactical operators was by producing and providing high quality gear and products that would enhance operator safety on the job. After AARDVARK's expansion and success, Becker founded PROJECT7, a provider of purpose-built, scalable, and configurable tactical platforms. Throughout this decades-long journey, Becker has learned invaluable lessons about the lives and work of law enforcement and tactical operators, leading him to a deep understanding of the principles and core values behind highly effective teams. After keynoting for many years on the leadership of elite units and what he terms ""culture-centric"" leadership, Becker is putting those lessons into The Debrief, a non-profit podcast that serves the wider public.

Although The Debrief focuses on the stories of tactical officers and team leaders, the audience is much more broad: leaders from all spheres, including business, entrepreneurship, communications, healthcare, law enforcement, and much more, will be informed and inspired by the lessons The Debrief has to impart. Jon and guests will cover conversations that are relevant to leaders of any field, including accountability, psychology, risk taking, and collaboration. The primary goal of The Debrief is to share these stories in the hopes of making us all better leaders, better thinkers, and better people.

The Debrief is available wherever you find your podcasts, including Spotify, Apple, YouTube, and Amazon. Since its release in early June, the podcast has been met with awesome reviews and coverage from other podcasts such as CATO and Tactical Breakdown, as well as outlets such as Police & Security News. Visit www.thedebrief.live to stay updated on the latest episodes as they release.

To set up an interview with Mr. Becker regarding The Debrief Podcast and its guests, or to learn more about The Debrief, please contact Boaz Kelson at boaz@fpwmedia.com or 541-790-1455.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:13:00+00:00,Leather Jacket Company Stands For Environmentally Responsible Practices,"Melbourne, Victoria, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

Sculpt Leather and Amy Anderson are pleased to announce that the latest leather jacket designs are now available. The design team works closely with the artisans to choose the ideal leather for each garment in the inventory. The versatility of leather is well known. It is a natural product that is produced in a wide range of styles. The design team works two seasons in advance in order to develop the best techniques for a one-of-a-kind finish. For nearly three decades, Sculpt Leather has been providing fine sheepskin and leather.

The leather used in the men's leather jackets is made from full-grain goats, sheep, and cow skins that are hand-tanned especially for Sculpt Leather at a state-of-the-art facility. This way, the company knows that the leather is tanned under good working conditions and is of the highest quality. Care and attention are paid to the environment. All materials are ethically sourced. Personal visits to the factories on a regular basis help to ensure that animals are treated humanely. Any dyes used do not leave a lasting environmental impact.

Further details can be seen at https://sculptleatherjackets.com.au/

The women's leather jackets are also created with an eye on today's styles. The designs are one-of-a-kind looks for everyday wear. The high-quality leather jackets are known for their durability. Discount store leather jackets are not a bargain because they don't last as long or look as good as premium jackets. An investment in quality leather can last a lifetime if they are properly cared for.

Shopping for a leather jacket online gives customers a much wider selection. Currently, all the jackets are handmade to order to ensure that the leather is fresh and safe. All jackets are delivered within ten to twelve business days.

About the Company:

Sculpt Leather has been providing top-quality leather products since 1993. The premium quality and excellent designs make the jackets an investment in the wardrobe for many years to come.

Although most of the stocks in BBC’s portfolio have delivered strong returns this year so far, a few have gained more than 45%. These include Day One Biopharmaceuticals DAWN, Mirati Therapeutics Inc. MRTX, Lyell Immunopharma Inc. LYEL, Kezar Life Sciences Inc. KZR and Repare Therapeutics Inc RPTX.

Traders on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets acted to bid up shares of heavily-shorted stocks, triggering a phenomenon known as a ""short squeeze"", which pushes up the stock prices higher. Notably, short squeeze is a term used by market participants to refer to a phenomenon where short-sellers in a stock, who placed their bets on its fall, rush to hedge their positions or buy the stock in the event of an adverse price movement to cover their losses. This leads to a sharp rise in demand for the share and a huge rally in share prices.

Additionally, the steep sell-off in the stock market induced a huge decline in biotech stocks. This made the valuations attractive, compelling investors to flock to the bargain stocks heading into the second half of 2022 (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Survived Market Turmoil in June). 

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of BBC.

BBC in Focus

Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF offers exposure to companies with promising drugs in clinical human trials that have not yet been approved by the FDA or gone into production. It follows the LifeSci Biotechnology Clinical Trials Index and holds 121 securities in its basket with none accounting for more than 2% share.

Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF amassed $15.6 million in its asset base and charges 79 bps in fees per year from its investors. It carries a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High-risk outlook.

Below we highlighted the above-mentioned five stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund’s basket:

The project also has BlindBox which can be used in-quiz to symbol a number but also serves as a way of earning at private sale phase.

The first is the Bitcoin price quiz, which ArenaPlay will use the Binance Bitcoin/USDT 1min line data to make sure the fair of quiz.

MUSD Stable Point

A lot of project use the token reward directly to their ecology, the potential risk here may cause a run on the token, thereby affecting the stability of the token price. ArenaPlay has finished this problem by using the stable point MUSD, MUSD only used at quiz Dapp, player should swap the $APC to MUSD to entry the quiz, and they can also swap MUSD to $APC when they withdrew.

BlindBox:

St. Bonaventure’s Master of Science in Education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling program helps support the growing need for Clinical Mental Health Counselors who can identify, prevent, and treat the surge in mental illness and behavioral disorders across the United States.

The United States is currently facing a mental health crisis, and Clinical Mental Health Counselors are helping Americans access life-saving treatment. According to Mental Health America (MHA), over half of adults in the U.S. with a mental illness do not receive treatment, totaling over 27 million adults. Younger populations in the U.S. are also facing higher rates of mental illness in the last few years; over 2.5 million youth have severe depression, and multiracial groups are at the greatest risk.

In addition to the rising rates of mental illness, the United States is seeing a surge in substance abuse. According to the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics (NCDAS), over 70,000 drug overdose deaths occur in the U.S annually, and drug and alcohol abuse increased over the pandemic.

Good Therapy states over 115 million people in the United States live in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. These are areas in which the ratio of mental health professionals to residents is smaller than 1 per 30,000 people. The solution is simple - we need more trained mental health professionals.

Current students aim to alleviate future pressure.

In St. Bonaventure’s CACREP-accredited online Master of Science in Education in Clinical Mental Health Counseling program, students complete engaging coursework and in-field practice and learn how to support individuals, families, and groups in overcoming personal challenges and improve mental health outcomes. In addition, students develop the necessary skills to help those in need, including individual and group counseling competencies, cultural competencies, communication, critical thinking, and ethical and legal responsibilities.

St Bonaventure University is devoted to the Franciscan values of compassion, wisdom, and integrity, which help graduates make a positive impact as community leaders, advocates, and practitioners who model compassionate service.

Delivered entirely online, students can balance existing commitments by logging in anywhere, at any time. The program is competitively priced and strategically designed to prepare students for in-demand roles working in Clinical Mental Health Counseling.

Tens of thousands of BT workers are to walk out in a national strike for the first time since being privatised under Margaret Thatcher following a row over pay.

Some 30,000 workers at Openreach and 9,000 call centre staff have voted to strike against what they described as an “unjust” and “unsustainable” wage deal.

However, a ballot of staff working at BT’s mobile subsidiary EE failed to reach the legal threshold of 50pc.

BT has offered staff an average pay rise of 5pc. Some of its lowest paid workers have been offered an increase of 8pc.

Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said that BT must table a “significantly improved” offer by next week or strike dates will be set.

He said: “Our members were never going to accept this imposition. BT Group thought they could get away with bullying treatment – they were wrong.”

A spokesman for BT said: “BT Group awarded its highest pay rise for frontline colleagues in more than 20 years.

“At the same time, we're in the middle of a once-in-a-generation investment programme to upgrade the country's broadband and mobile networks.

“These investments are vital for the benefit of our millions of customers and for the UK economy. Above all, they are central to the success of this business - and its colleagues - now and in the future.

“Our job is to balance the competing demands of BT Group's stakeholders and that requires careful management, especially in a challenging economic environment.” BT openreach strike - Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg

The spectre of a mass walkout at BT comes little more than a week after the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT) launched its biggest strike in a generation as union bosses vowed a ""summer of discontent"".

Hundreds of check-in and ground handling crew at British Airways have also voted in favour of strike action at Heathrow.

It is thought that the next wave of industrial action on the railways could coincide with a shutdown at airports.

Some 115,000 Royal Mail workers are currently being balloted for strike action.

Story continues

Mr Ward said that BT had failed to recognise the hard work of staff during the pandemic.

He said: “Without CWU members working across BT Group, there would have been no home-working revolution.

“This work, which was done under great difficulty and often came with tremendous personal sacrifice, delivered £1.3 billion profits for the company.

“The reward for our members? The imposition of a below-inflation increase – the very same workers who delivered profits that were more like lottery numbers than actual wages.

“Our members, and working people in general, have had enough.

“We will not accept seeing workers use food banks while executives use Swiss banks. For too long now, corporate bosses have been rewarded for wrecking companies, chipping away at workers’ conditions so their rich mates get even richer.

“This situation is unjust, but it’s also untenable – people will not work harder and harder for less and less forever.”",https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bt-workers-strike-first-time-170620311.html,"['BT-A.LSE', 'BTGOF.US', 'BTQ.F', 'BTQ.XETRA']"

Long term rehab provides a more intensive approach for alcohol and drug abuse recovery services. The facilities used for this category offer people more time to conquer their substance abuse and ultimately attain sobriety. Due to this extended treatment, a recovering individual is able to spend more time in learning and acquiring vital life skills and coping mechanisms that will be stronger in supporting their sobriety in the future.

It is important to note that whether people are struggling with an alcohol addiction or drug abuse, they can benefit from recovering at a long-term treatment facility. But there are a number of individuals who will benefit more from this type of care compared to others, especially those who have more severe habits of substance abuse, or those who have dual diagnosis or co-occurring disorders. Some of those who are struggling with drug or alcohol abuse started their habits as a way to self-medicate their mental health concerns. And the highs provided by the substances they abuse may have alleviated their negative emotions and thoughts. Unfortunately, the effect is only temporary and likely made the problems worse over time. In fact, many forms of addiction can usually result in the development of additional mental health problems because chronic substance abuse can cause lasting chemical changes in the body. Thus, those who are suffering a severe form of addiction may need to undergo long-term residential treatment from therapeutic communities.

Arizona rehab centers may provide the most suitable choice with regards to long-term addiction treatment. This is because they offer a unique and picturesque environment that is perfect for the serenity that people require to attain a sober life.

Meanwhile, for those who are struggling with meth addiction, they will need help from a meth detox center to get the necessary support in dealing the unpleasant physical and psychological side effects of quitting meth. A meth detox program will gradually purge the body from this harmful and dangerous substance, allowing the affected individual to gradually adjust to a life without meth use. It is important to note that it is not advisable to undergo meth detox on their own because it can be extremely uncomfortable and even dangerous to go through with out the help of professionals.

And for those who are struggling with cocaine addiction, there are also detox centers to help them cope with the withdrawal symptoms, which can be extremely uncomfortable, physically and mentally. These symptoms are so severe that quitting cocaine without professional support is impossible. Detox centers for cocaine have the clinical and medical professionals who can guide the individual’s journey through detoxification. And it is vital to note that the intensity of the withdrawal symptoms is unique for each individual, which means that the detox programs have to be personalized to be suitable for each client’s individual needs.

Started in 2017, the Pathfinders Recovery Center has more than 25 years of combined experience in offering treatment for different kinds of addiction and co-occurring disorders and in helping people struggling with an addiction to finally be on their path towards recovery. They have the capability of providing drug and alcohol rehab services at their modern treatment facilities in Colorado and Arizona. And they have also crafted a program that teaches responsibility, honesty, integrity, leadership, and hard work to their clients. The main purpose of their program is for clients to finally experience a sober life in the end. And they provide people struggling with an addiction various types of tools for them to have a strong foundation for them to establish a clean, sober, and accomplished life.

People who are interested in learning more about the drug and alcohol rehab services in Colorado, including their cocaine detox center, can check out the Pathfinders Recovery Center website, or contact them on the telephone.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:04:00+00:00,"Icarus Behavioral Health Explains the Dangers of Black Tar Heroin, Meth and Other Drugs","Albuquerque, New Mexico, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

Icarus Behavioral Health, an alcohol and drug rehab facility in Albuquerque, NM, has recently published three articles related to drug addiction, with a special focus on tar black, which is a drug that is not often mentioned in the news. The second article is about the comedown that results from abusing meth and the third article is a guide on finding a fentanyl rehab center that is nearby. As always, those who are struggling with an addiction to heroin, meth, fentanyl or any other kind of dangerous substance, or have a loved one who has an addiction, are encouraged to contact the team of professionals at Icarus Behavioral Health.

Black tar heroin is a crudely manufactured heroin from the chemicals extracted from the opium poppy that is cooked down by inexperienced chemists, resulting in a sticky brown substance. Because fentanyl is a much more profitable substance to produce, the illegal drug trade has focused on it, which has made black tar heroin much more difficult to find. Although fentanyl is technically more potent than heroin, those who are addicted to opioids tend to prefer heroin because it provides more euphoria and is a much more enjoyable drug for them to do.

While people from various parts of the world have been using black tar heroin, its use has been on a downtrend since the mid-2010s. But this decline is due to the drug cartels shifting their focus on fentanyl, which is much cheaper for them to produce and thus more profitable. With fentanyl, they no longer have to plant poppy crops. All they have to do is purchase in bulk the precursor chemicals from China and have the Mexican chemists synthesize fentanyl. Thus, while it may seem like good news that black tar usage is declining, this is only because it has been mostly replaced by fentanyl use. Whether people or their loved ones are struggling with their addiction to heroin or fentanyl, they are encouraged to contact Icarus Behavioral Health for guidance on how they can get on the road to recovery.

Meanwhile, those who abuse methamphetamine typically experience a meth comedown after the end of a binge. This usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. This is because meth is an “upper” and the brain no longer functions normally. After binging with meth, the addicted person experiences the opposite of being up and may start to have hallucinations and may talk with people who aren’t real. They may develop insane paranoia and anxiety. And aside from the damage to the brain, meth can have physical side effects, such as hair loss, tooth grinding, scratching, and more. Meth users often have meth sores resulting from meth crystallizing under the skin, which results in a lot of irritation. Affected individuals feel like there are spiders or mites crawling all over them.

To make the meth comedown a littler easier, it is recommended for the user to get professional help. Meth users will need to undergo detox before they can go to a recovery facility. Going through a meth detox or comedown on their own can be very dangerous since there have been people who have harmed or even killed themselves as a result of the hopeless and uncomfortable feeling.

Icarus Behavioral Health had made its sole mission to become the top substance abuse treatment facility for the residents of the state of New Mexico. And indeed, they have been able to attain such leadership status in behavioral healthcare by offering the best possible personalized and evidence-based treatment for a wide variety of substance use and mental health issues. They have also managed to take advantage of the intrinsic benefits provided by the amazing views of the natural attractions in New Mexico and the Southwestern United States as a way to boost and augment their clients’ experiences as they move towards recovery. Because of their in-depth knowledge of the unique needs of their community, in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, and also throughout the Southwest, they are also able to provide a vital resource for maternal mental wellness or mental health.

People who are interested in learning more about drug abuse treatment, such as finding a heroin, meth, or fentanyl rehab near me, can visit the website of Icarus Behavioral Health, or contact them through the telephone.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:02:30+00:00,"Germany Risks ‘Imminent’ Recession on Gas Cutoff, Deutsche Bank Says","(Bloomberg) -- European economies are facing a major new shock from slowing deliveries of Russian natural gas, which threaten to push inflation even higher than the current record levels and drive the continent’s powerhouse Germany into “imminent” recession, Deutsche Bank said.

“What is unfolding in Europe in recent days is a fresh big negative supply shock,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, citing a 60% fall in gas flows via the Nord Stream pipeline earlier this month. “If the gas shutoff is not resolved in coming weeks we worry this will lead to a broadening out of energy disruption with material upfront effects on economic growth, and of course much higher inflation.”

The latest squeeze on energy supplies as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine has raised alarm levels across the continent -- especially in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy and one off the most reliant on Russian gas. Economy Minister Robert Habeck has warned that turmoil from gas markets could spread more broadly, comparing the risk to the crisis triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

The Berlin government said Thursday it’s in talks to provide “stabilization measures” for utility Uniper SE, which is losing some 30 million euros ($31 million) a day because it has to cover missing Russian supplies at soaring spot-market prices. Chemicals giant BASF SE, which relies on gas for production and electricity, said it may have to cut output.

Europe’s energy crisis is spurring ever-louder recession warnings. Morgan Stanley economists said earlier this week that they now expect the euro area to fall into a contraction in the last quarter of this year, largely because of the risk of reduced natural gas flows.

Story continues

Persistent gas shortfalls would “raise the risk of an imminent German recession on the back of energy rationing,” as well as signaling “clear downside” for the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar, the Deutsche Bank analysts said.

The pot producer tumbled as much as 22% to an almost five-year low of $2.72, after announcing the deal, which also boosts main shareholder Constellation Brands Inc.’s stake. Canopy ranks among the biggest losers in the cannabis sector this year as the industry falters under the glacial pace of US legalization.

Canopy agreed to swap C$255.4 million ($198 million) of debt for shares and C$3 million in cash for accrued and unpaid interest. Through the deal, Constellation will acquire from 21.9 million to 30.7 million Canopy stock at a value of about $2.50 to $3.50 each. The US alcohol producer currently has a 36% stake in the cannabis producer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The agreement “reinforces the weight of its cash-burn rate as it continues to right-size its business model,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea said. “The step will increase Constellation’s stake to above 40% and closer to majority control.”

The move comes as analyst slash their price targets on the stock and investors abandon the sector, with Canopy struggling to hold onto its share in the home market. The stock has tumbled 67% this year, making it one of the top 10 worst performers in the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF -- also known by the ticker MJ -- which has dropped 48%.

Canopy’s average price target on its US listing has been gutted by about 60% this year, dropping to $4.85 from $12. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, CIBC Capital Markets, Piper Sandler and MKM Partners made further cuts this week, citing Canopy’s slowing revenue growth as competition in the sector rises and pressure on the company to manage its debt. On Monday, Fitch Ratings downgraded its rating to ‘CCC’ from ‘B-’ on the company’s “significant” market share losses and “weak operating results with an uncertain path to profitability and reduced liquidity.”

Story continues

“The risk of continued pressure on equity valuation remains elevated as the company utilizes its cash coffers to fund sizable operating losses” and “the potential for sizable dilution in order to reduce its overall debt load as part of its turnaround initiatives,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Bottomley said in a note to clients.

""Our ambition is to create the world's best oil and gas company with low costs, low emissions, profitable growth and attractive dividends. We will also play an important role in the global energy transition,"" says Aker BP CEO, Karl Johnny Hersvik.

The merged company is the second largest operating company on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). The company has a substantial resource base which provides a very good foundation for further growth and leads the way in terms of both low costs and low emissions per barrel.

""In 2016, Aker ASA worked in tandem with bp to merge Det Norske and BP Norge into Aker BP. The ambition back then was to create the leading exploration and production company offshore. Now we're taking another big step, in cooperation with the Lundin family. Together, we will work to develop Aker BP into the oil and gas company of the future. We will lead the way when it comes to low costs, low carbon, profitable growth and attractive dividends. We will also take the lead to bring about fundamental improvements, such as through digitalisation,"" says chair of Aker BP's board, Øyvind Eriksen.

The best team

Aker BP is uniquely positioned for profitable growth. The company will operate or participate as a partner in most of the major field developments on the NCS in the next few years, with NOAKA, a new central platform on Valhall, the King Lear tie-back to Valhall, Wisting and Skarv satellites as the largest projects. Overall, Aker BP plans to invest more than NOK 150 billion in development projects in the period up to 2030. During the same period, the company will drill around 180 new wells and carry out an exciting exploration programme. All this will contribute to significant production growth in the years ahead.

""The leading company needs to have the leading team. With the merger of Aker BP and Lundin, I'm confident that we have the best team on the Norwegian shelf. But we're going to need even more people to join in and help us create the E&P company of the future,"" says Karl Johnny Hersvik.

Will give more back to society

The development projects, the exploration activity and operation of our six production hubs create significant positive ripple effects for the supplier industry, along with tens of thousands of jobs with highly competent companies across the country.

""These are the same companies that will further develop the knowledge and expertise needed to deliver on renewable projects,"" says Hersvik.

He points out that the energy transition is the largest and most important strategic challenge the industry has ever faced.

""The world needs more energy which is sustainable, affordable and reliable. Aker BP is already today among the oil and gas companies in the world with the lowest CO2 intensity. We are progressing according to plan to achieve our targets to reduce our emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and plan to neutralise the remaining emissions,"" says Hersvik.

""In addition to reducing emissions, the oil and gas resources must be managed in a way that gives even more back to society,"" he adds.

That's why Aker BP has made a strong commitment to a wide range of digitalisation measures aimed at increasing productivity. At the same time, the company is working closely with its alliance partners to maximise value creation and reduce emissions. The company wants to lead the way in transforming the oil and gas industry.

""We want the industry to work together more closely, and to share more. We intend to build the foundation for new industries to emerge. We will reduce emissions from our activities. And we will bolster the profitability. Increased value creation gives the State and our owners capital that could be invested in new business and industry,"" says Hersvik.

Integration in three phases

The initial announcement of Aker BP's acquisition of Lundin Energy's E&P business was made on 21 December 2021.

The merger will be implemented in three stages:

From 1 July this year, Lundin Energy Norway AS will operate as a fully owned subsidiary of Aker BP ASA. The subsidiary's name is changed to ABP Norway AS. From 1 October, all employees will be fully integrated into a single organization ABP Norway AS will then, according to the plan, be merged with Aker BP ASA as soon as it is practically feasible.

ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE.

Achieved our $8 billion sustainable finance goal ahead of schedule and today announced a new $100 billion environmental and social finance target to be achieved through 2030. We achieved four of five of our original 2017 operational sustainability goals and recently expanded them, including to continue purchasing 100% renewable power, reducing location based GHG emissions1 by 75%, reducing energy use by 40%, reducing potable water use by 50%, diverting 75% of waste from going to landfills, and reducing paper use by 75% and purchasing remaining paper from certified sources.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:00:05+00:00,Best-Performing ETF Areas of Q2,"After a downbeat Q1, Wall Street has maintained its lackluster journey in Q2. The first half of 2022 could easily be attributed to the Russia-Ukraine war, red-hot inflation and rising-rate worries. The Fed enacted a steep interest rate hike worth 50 basis points in May and another one of 75 bps in June.

No wonder, many analysts are forecasting an U.S. recession this year as the economy is still striving to recover from the pandemic. Notably, the American economy contracted an annualized 1.5% quarter on quarter in Q1 of 2022, following 6.9% growth in Q4 of 2021. The yield curve inverted many times in the second quarter, signaling recession risks.

The S&P 500 has declined 15% in the past three months while the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq have lost 10% and 19.7%, respectively.  Oil prices have gained moderately as United States Oil Fund, LP (USO) added only 2.7% in Q2. Global slowdown fears probably quelled the demand for oil.

Against this backdrop, below, we highlight a few ETF areas that stood out in Q2

Agriculture

The year can be remembered because of the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Notably, both countries are commodity-rich and the war has sent prices for energy, grains and metals surging. Plus, overall commodities prices have been rising lately.

Teucrium Corn ETF CORN and iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return JO added about 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, in the past three months (as of Jun 27, 2022).

China

China ETFs were hit hard earlier in the year due to stringent regulatory scrutiny along with tight COVID-control measures and the resultant lockdown. Chinese tech equities started rebounding in late April as the nation’s top political leaders planned on Friday to boost economic stimulus to promote growth. There could also be an easing of the continued clampdown on tech firms.

Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF CHIQ (up 15.8%), KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB (up 9.8%) and Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF (PGJ) (up 7.5%) were among the prominent winners.

Story continues

U.S. Dollar

To contain the red-hot inflation, central banks are tightening policies. The Fed had enacted three rate hikes so far this year and pushed through a total hike worth 150 basis points. Such steep rate hikes boosted the value of greenback in Q2. Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF UUP was up about 5.2% in the past three months.

U.S. Consumer Staples

As the global markets crashed, volatility ETFs ruled. As a result, the demand for safe sectors like consumer staples jumped. Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF PSCC (up 2.3%), Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF RHS (up 1.9%) and iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF IYK (up 0.1%) were the winning staples ETFs.

Short-Term U.S. Government Bonds

Rising rate worries are gripping the whole world, crippling the investing scenario again with uncertainty. The Fed rate hike has been extremely pronounced lately. Since short-term bonds are less sensitive to rising rates, SPDR Bloomberg 13 Month T-Bill ETF BIL added about 0.1% in the past three months. Plus, with faster Fed rate hikes, yields on short-term bonds also rose simultaneously.

OAKLAND, Calif., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) announced it has broken ground on the first of up to 130 new electric vehicle (EV) charging ports at 22 schools in its service area.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220630005257/en/

(Photo: Business Wire)

The first installation is at Eastside College Preparatory School in East Palo Alto, Calif. Overall, PG&E’s EV Charge Schools pilot program aims to help fill charging gaps at these locations and support California’s clean transportation and decarbonization goals.

Through the EV Charge Schools pilot, PG&E will install level 2 charging stations at school facilities and educational institutions for staff, parents and students to charge their EVs, with access varying by location. PG&E will help fund the costs of purchasing and installing the EV charging equipment and networking fees at these schools as well as ongoing maintenance and operations. With up to 40% of the new chargers located in disadvantaged communities, the pilot will help to bring EV charging options to customers who might not have had them before.

PG&E also will develop EV and sustainability curriculum for all schools in its service area along with teacher training options. The kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum will allow teachers to connect classroom learning to real-world infrastructure and help expand awareness of clean energy transportation.

""By increasing charging access at schools, we strive to make electric vehicles a viable option for more Californians. Expanding the use of clean transportation and reducing vehicle emissions is good for our state, our customers and the environment,"" said PG&E’s Aaron August, Vice President, Business Development and Customer Engagement.

Why Clean Transportation Matters

Clean transportation efforts are a central pillar of PG&E’s Climate Strategy Report, which outlines the company’s plans to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, five years ahead of the state’s target, and to start actively removing more greenhouse gases from the environment than it emits by 2050. To help reach these goals, PG&E plans to be the industry’s global model by preparing its grid to fuel at least 3 million EVs by 2030—leading to a cumulative reduction of 58 million metric tons of carbon emissions.

These recent commitments build upon PG&E’s history of leadership in the area of clean transportation. Over 420,000 EVs have been sold in PG&E’s service area, representing one in six EVs in the country. Increasing EV adoption can play a critical role in supporting California’s goals to reduce emissions as transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions in the state, contributing nearly 40%. Passenger vehicles alone account for nearly 29% of the state’s total emissions. By 2035, 100% of California sales of new passenger cars and trucks will have zero tailpipe-emissions.

The electricity fueling EVs in California comes from one of the cleanest energy mixes in the country. PG&E estimates that 93% of its customers’ electricity in 2021 came from greenhouse gas-free resources.

PG&E’s Continued Support for EVs

As part of its first EV charging infrastructure program, EV Charge Network, PG&E installed 4,827 Level 2 EV charging ports at customer sites across Northern and Central California. EV Fleet Program: Aims to install or rebate make-ready electrical infrastructure to support the adoption of 6,500 medium- and heavy-duty EVs. EV Fast Charge Program for Public Fast Chargers: Complements state and privately funded initiatives by installing Direct Current (DC) fast charging in highway corridor and urban sites. PG&E has seen high demand for the program, receiving five times the applications for available funding. EV Charge Parks: Will provide charging infrastructure at California State Parks and Beaches in support of California’s electrification goals. Special Rates, Rebates and Tools: PG&E offers electric rate plans tailored for EV drivers and provides tools such as PG&E’s EV Savings Calculator and Fleet Calculator (ev.pge.com and fleets.pge.com) to help customers understand costs when deciding whether to drive an EV.

AAPL,2022-06-30T17:00:00+00:00,Fidelity Life: What is 10-Year Term Life Insurance?,"CHICAGO, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- When selecting a term life insurance policy, life insurance shoppers must decide how long they want coverage. One common term policy that's selected is 10-year term life insurance. Some of the people that can benefit from this policy include young families, those planning to retire soon, or those who are almost about to pay off their mortgage. Before choosing this type of life insurance, it's important to know what 10-year term life insurance is, how it works, and who can benefit from it.

What 10-year term life insurance is and how it works

10-year term life insurance is a policy that provides a decade of guaranteed insurance. If a person dies within that time period, their beneficiary will receive the coverage amount. This coverage amount is generally tax-free. The insured person's premium will remain the same during the duration of the term. Once the 10 years have passed, the policy will expire. Depending on the provider, a policyholder may be able to convert it to a permanent policy. A 10-year term policy is considered to be one of the more affordable life insurance options.

Factors influencing the premium rates of a 10-year term policy include age, current health, and health history. Health is a significant factor in how high the premiums will be. Example: The premium cost for a 30-year-old non-smoker male with a $500,000 coverage can be around $13 to $28. The same 30-year-old male who happens to be a smoker may pay as much as $50 to $106 for a similar policy. Some 10-year term life insurance policies are available to life insurance shoppers without a medical exam but taking a medical exam can help shoppers get the best rates.

Who can benefit from 10-year term life insurance?

Depending on life and financial circumstances, some life insurance shoppers can benefit more from a 10-year term life policy than others. One example is a young family. Parents with middle school-aged children often desire to support their kids into young adulthood and help pay for their college tuition. Ten years can be enough time until the children are old enough to support themselves financially. Another example is if an individual is planning on retiring in 10 years. The policy can provide financial security for their family until they reach retirement and Social Security starts.

Some life insurance shoppers may have less than 10 years on their mortgage. A high enough coverage amount on a 10-year term policy could pay off the mortgage in the event the policyholder passes away, reducing their family's financial burden. Life insurance shoppers can consider other debts, such as credit cards, loans, and living expenses when determining the best coverage amount.

The bottom line

A 10-year term policy may be ideal for both young families and older adults. Life insurance shoppers will want to evaluate their current financial circumstances to determine if 10-year term insurance is right for them.

Fidelity Life offers term life insurance policies online and with the help of a licensed agent, making it easier to get coverage.

Analyst Harsh Kumar noted that Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ: MU) generates ~70% of its revenue from DRAM, posing a risk as the three-month rolling average continued to decline on a Y/Y basis.

For NAND, pricing for 256Gb TLC declined 7% M/M, and the three-month rolling average fell 5% Y/Y. He noted that these dynamics could pose a significant headwind to revenue growth as they move through calendar 2022, mainly as mobile and notebook end-markets face continued weakness.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:58:00+00:00,Oberon Fuels Joins International Trade Associations,"SAN DIEGO, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oberon Fuels (“Oberon”), a maker of products that reduce greenhouse gas emissions of major energy sectors, has joined both the World Biogas Association (WBA) and Liquid Gas Europe as Oberon continues to build upon its work in Europe and around the world.

Oberon has developed a straightforward ‘here-now’ way to slash the CO2 emissions of the global Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG or propane) industry through the production of renewable dimethyl ether (rDME). Because rDME can be stored, transported and dispensed using existing LPG vehicles and equipment, it can be readily blended with fossil LPG to reduce carbon emissions by up to 60 percent. The intersection between rDME made from biogas and the LPG industry is a key reason for Oberon to join these trade associations.

The EU consumes about 48 billion liters (12.7 billion gallons) of LPG per year, of which an estimated 3.8 billion liters (1 billion gallons) are imported from Russia. Oberon Fuels can enable European countries to produce fuels from local renewable biomass with no indirect land use impacts while reducing the need to import foreign energy resources. To help meet the goals of the EU Green Deal, the EU market is ready for new approaches to decarbonizing a range of major uses including transport, heating and agriculture.

Oberon’s interest in expanding into Europe and other global markets is intended to accelerate commercial adoption of rDME with near-term market trials leading to deployment of multiple commercial-scale production plants. Oberon already has strategic collaborations with leaders around the world including Suburban Propane (US) and South America-based Lipigas. Oberon executives were in Switzerland recently presenting at the International DME Association’s annual event, and company CEO Rebecca Boudreaux, Ph.D., spoke earlier today at the European Liquid Gas Congress event in Barcelona.

About Oberon Fuels
California-based Oberon Fuels is on a mission to decarbonize the fuel and energy sectors through the commercialization of renewable dimethyl ether (rDME). Oberon’s low or carbon-negative rDME can reduce the carbon intensity of propane by up to 60 percent when blended, offering potential reductions in global CO2 of 750 million metric tons per year. rDME’s characteristics also makes it a compelling means for transporting hydrogen for its myriad, fast-growing applications.

He’s been responsible for making billions by investing in stocks and has become an idol to many people. Due to his success, Warren Buffett stocks are highly sought after when creating a balanced portfolio.

Buffett is a highly successful investor with many principles based on economic theory and common sense.

The first principle of Buffett’s investing philosophy is to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy when others are fearful. This means we should not invest during times of high optimism but instead wait for a correction or downturn.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s largest companies by market capitalization.

Since its creation in 2015, Alphabet has become the most valuable company in the world. This is due to Google’s stock price increase, which leads to Alphabet’s market cap increase.

Alphabet was created as a holding company for Google and other projects of former Google CEO Larry Page and his co-founder Sergey Brin. It is now one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization. It is the parent company of Google and several other companies previously owned by it. Alphabet’s portfolio includes more than 100 life sciences, robotics, finance, and technology companies.

It has a 20-for-1 stock split coming up after the close of business on July 15. It is yet another reason to purchase this business since the stock split will give access to a massive horde of retail traders that previously could not afford the stock.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT)  is a company that started as a small grocery store in Arkansas in the 1950s to provide low prices to customers. Now, Walmart has grown into one of the largest retail chains in the world.

Walmart began by opening its first store in Rogers, Arkansas. The first Walmart had 10 employees and sold groceries at discount prices because it was located close to a major highway and could offer lower transportation costs for goods than other stores. Today, Walmart has approximately 10,500 stores with nearly 2.3 million employees.

The main reason for Walmart’s success is that it provides low-priced goods to customers through high-volume sales. Revenues in full-year 2022 came in at $572.75 billion, an increase of 2.4% from the previous fiscal year figure ($559.15 billion). When inflation is breaking records, one cannot undermine Walmart’s importance. Hence, it is one of the better defensive Warren Buffett stocks.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) and other computer hardware. Nvidia’s GPUs are the backbone of many AI systems and deep learning applications, including healthcare research, autonomous vehicles, and robotics development.

Nvidia’s primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs).

Nvidia’s GPUs are the heart of many devices, including mobile phone chargers and tablet computers. It is also used for high-performance computing applications such as video editing and 3D computer graphics rendering on workstations or a PC with a single card or multiple cards connected to form an accelerated computing cluster.

Due to the supply chain issues, Nvidia has come under some pressure. In its latest earnings, the tech giant reported $8.29 billion in revenue, the top line growing 46.41%. However, earnings were down substantially from a year ago. Since the company is investing heavily in areas like the metaverse and data centers, that is expected. But the global supply chain crisis is affecting its bottom line. It will help if you keep a short-term headwind in mind moving forward.

Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is a multinational company that provides various products and services from consumer to enterprise. The company was founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard.

Hewlett-Packard is best known for its computer hardware products, such as desktop and laptop computers, printers, and other imaging devices, as well as its computer software like the Microsoft Windows operating system or HP Officejet Pro printing solutions for home users or enterprise clients.

Critics can argue HP is not the company it used to be. However, HP’s annual revenue for 2021 was $63.5 billion, a 12.09% increase from the previous year. Granted, you can chalk up much of this performance to the pandemic. People needed computers and printers more than ever. And that shows in HP’s results.

The price of oil is not coming down. It has been going up for the last few months, and the trend does not seem to be stopping anytime soon. The oil price is one of the most important indicators for the global economy, so it is a big deal that it’s not coming down.

During this environment, OXY is looking like a solid choice.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:50:57+00:00,Tesla: Wall Street wary of Q2 deliveries,"As automakers prepare to release second quarter delivery numbers, concern is growing on Wall Street that Tesla’s (TSLA) report could be a big downer.

In particular, the concern is over Tesla’s deliveries from its Shanghai gigafactory, which was shut down for most of April and took some time to ramp up to pre-shut down levels. Recall that in May and parts of June the factory was operating in a “closed-loop” system in which workers were residing and working at the factory in limited shifts.

Despite CEO Elon Musk warning Tesla employees of an “insane end-of-quarter delivery push,” Wall Street sell-side analysts are still taking down their second quarter delivery estimates, only days before Tesla’s Q2 delivery and production report will come out.

First up is Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank, known as a Tesla bull on the Street. Rosner cut his Q2 delivery estimate by 65,000 vehicles, to 245,000. Rosner said this cut reflects a “prolonged COVID-19–related shutdown and logistical challenges in the Shanghai factory” for Tesla.

Next up is Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney, who is expecting weak Q2 results across the board for the autos sector due to the COVID restrictions in China, though especially for Tesla given its “higher exposure to the Shanghai/China region.”

Delaney notes the bank had lowered its Q2 delivery estimates way back at the end of May due to the Shanghai shutdown and Tesla’s start-up costs for Giga Berlin and Giga Austin. Delaney now sees “downside risk to [Goldman's] 261K delivery assumption for 2Q given recent company comments on challenges ramping in Texas and Berlin, and deliveries could be about in line with buy-side consensus at around 250K.” Delaney has a Buy rating on Tesla with a $1,000 price target.

Finally, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities just put out a note this morning on Tesla. Ives, known as one of the biggest Tesla bulls on the Street, is concerned about the “albatross” around Tesla’s neck — China's Zero COVID policy, which has been a “major headwind” for production.

Story continues

Ives is now looking for deliveries in the 250,000 range for Q2, down from the 277,000 he had been forecasting most recently. Anything above 260,000 deliveries will be viewed positively, he says, but the real focus will be looking ahead to the balance of 2022.

“In a nutshell, while June delivery numbers will be ugly and nothing to write home about, the Street will be focused on the trajectory for 2H and the overall demand picture staying firm,” Ives said, while maintaining his Outperform rating and $1,000 price target.

Tesla stock is trading down around 1.5% in midday trade, adding to its substantial 36% loss year to date.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.

Lundin Energy AB (“Lundin Energy” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the completion of the combination (the “Combination”) of Lundin Energy’s E&P business with Aker BP ASA (“Aker BP”). The Combination creates the leading European independent E&P company with a world class asset base, industry leading low operating costs and low carbon emissions, with increased and sustainable dividends. Shareholders will also retain their existing holding in Lundin Energy’s renewables focussed growth business, which is changing its name to Orrön Energy AB (“Orrön Energy”) as of 1 July 2022. Due to the completion of the Combination, Lundin Energy will not, in accordance with the resolution at the Annual General Meeting 2022, pay any of the remaining quarterly cash dividends resolved upon at the Annual General Meeting.

In exchange for Lundin Energy’s E&P business portfolio, shareholders will be entitled to:

Cash totalling BUSD 2.22 (SEK 78.78 per share after conversion from USD)271,910,019 Aker BP shares (0.95098 Aker BP shares, represented by Swedish Depository Receipts, for each share in Lundin Energy)Retain their existing shareholding in Lundin Energy, which will change its name to Orrön Energy as of 1 July 2022 and become a renewables focussed growth business

Accordingly, following the completion of the Combination, the shareholders of Lundin Energy will hold 43 percent of the total number of shares and votes of Aker BP (based on 632,022,210 shares and votes in Aker BP).

The Annual General Meeting of Lundin Energy resolved on 31 March 2022 on a quarterly cash dividend of USD 0.5625 per share, corresponding to USD 160 million (rounded off) per quarter. The payment of each quarterly cash dividend was made conditional upon that the Company owns all shares in Lundin Energy MergerCo AB (publ) on the record date for the relevant quarterly cash dividend. The first quarterly dividend was paid on 7 April 2022. Since the Combination now has been completed and the Company no longer owns any shares in Lundin Energy MergerCo AB (publ), the Company will not pay any of the remaining quarterly cash dividends.

More information for shareholders around the Combination, a timetable for the payment of the merger consideration and how Swedish Depositary Receipts received by the shareholders can be converted into a direct holding of Oslo Stock Exchange listed shares in Aker BP can be found on: https://www.lundin-energy.com

Ian Lundin, outgoing Chairman of Lundin Energy, commented:
“Since its inception a bit over two decades ago, Lundin Energy has grown into something none of us dared to dream of, with the per share value having grown around 150 times, providing a compound annual average return to shareholders of 28 percent per year for over 20 years. Through hard work and perseverance and above all a strong management team, the Company flourished into one of the leading E&P companies globally. A new page in the Company's history is turning, with the combination of Aker BP with Lundin Energy’s Norwegian business ensuring continued strong production growth and thus sustainable dividend growth into the next decade. Value creation and long-term growth is at the heart of the Lundin Energy ethos and that is what this deal is all about.

“I am convinced that unique investment opportunities will be created in the global energy transition, and we will be involved in building continued shareholder value from this process, through the birth of Orrön Energy. I would like to thank all our fellow shareholders for your support over the years, and I very much look forward to a new era of value creation – both in Aker BP and Orrön Energy.”

Nick Walker, outgoing President and CEO of Lundin Energy, commented;
“I am very pleased to announce the completion of this landmark transaction with Aker BP. Value creation is at the heart of our business and this combination is a unique opportunity to create a world-leading E&P company, with significant scale, production growth and strong free cashflow generation into the next decade. Coupled with that is a business with industry leading low costs and low carbon emissions.

“I am convinced that the combination with Aker BP is a “win-win” outcome for both sets of shareholders, as it creates a business that is positioned to prosper through the energy transition and deliver increased and sustainable dividends. I am also excited to follow the progress of Orrön Energy, which has the right management team, governance and balance sheet to really take advantage of the huge opportunities presented by the energy transition.

“I would like to thank all our stakeholders for your tremendous support over many years, our employees for their outstanding efforts in creating such a great business and finally the Board of Directors who have consistently empowered and supported the management team in our endeavours.”

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:50:00+00:00,Sammanslagningen mellan Lundin Energys prospekterings- och produktionsverksamhet och Aker BP är genomförd,"EJ FÖR OFFENTLIGGÖRANDE, PUBLICERING ELLER DISTRIBUTION, HELT ELLER DELVIS, DIREKT ELLER INDIREKT, INOM ELLER TILL USA, AUSTRALIEN, KANADA, HONGKONG ELLER JAPAN, ELLER NÅGON ANNAN JURISDIKTION DÄR OFFENTLIGGÖRANDE, PUBLICERING ELLER DISTRIBUTION SKULLE VARA OLAGLIGT. DETTA PRESSMEDDELANDE UTGÖR INTE ETT ERBJUDANDE AVSEENDE NÅGOT AV DE VÄRDEPAPPER SOM BESKRIVS HÄRI.

Lundin Energy AB (”Lundin Energy” eller ”bolaget”) meddelar att sammanslagningen (”Sammanslagningen”)av Lundin Energys prospekterings- ochproduktionsverksamhetmed Aker BP ASA (”Aker BP”) är genomförd. Sammanslagningen skapar det ledande europeiska prospekterings- och produktionsbolaget med en tillgångsbas i världsklass, industriledande låga verksamhetskostnader och låga koldioxidutsläpp samt växande och hållbara utdelningar. Aktieägare kommer att behålla sitt befintliga aktieinnehav i Lundin Energy och dess verksamhet inom förnybar energi, som byter namn till Orrön Energy AB (”Orrön Energy”) från den 1 juli 2022. Med anledning av genomförandet av Sammanslagningen kommer Lundin Energy, i enlighet med beslutet vid årsstämman 2022, inte betala ut de återstående kvartalsvisa kontantutdelningarna som årsstämman beslutade om.

I utbyte mot Lundin Energys prospekterings- och produktionsverksamhet kommer aktieägare att:

Erhålla ett kontant vederlag uppgående till sammanlagt 2,22 miljarder USD (78,78 SEK per aktie efter omräkning från USD)Erhålla sammanlagt 271 910 019 aktier i Aker BP (0,95098 aktier i Aker BP, som representeras av svenska depåbevis, för varje utestående aktie i Lundin Energy)Behålla sitt befintliga aktieinnehav i Lundin Energy som byter namn till Orrön Energy den 1 juli 2022 och blir ett bolag fokuserat på tillväxt inom förnybar energi

Efter genomförandet av Sammanslagningen kommer aktieägare i Lundin Energy följaktligen äga 43 procent av det totala antalet aktier och röster i Aker BP (baserat på 632 022 210 aktier och röster i Aker BP).

Årsstämman i Lundin Energy den 31 mars 2022 beslutade om en kvartalsvis kontantutdelning om 0,5625 USD per aktie, vilket motsvarar cirka 160 miljoner USD (avrundat) per kvartal. Utbetalningen av respektive kvartalsvis utdelning var villkorad av att bolaget äger samtliga aktier i Lundin Energy MergerCo AB (publ) på avstämningsdagen för respektive utdelning. Den första kvartalsvisa utdelningen utbetalades den 7 april 2022. Eftersom Sammanslagningen nu har genomförts och bolaget inte längre äger några aktier i Lundin Energy MergerCo AB (publ) kommer bolaget inte att betala ut någon del av den återstående kvartalsvisa kontantutdelningen.

Mer information för aktieägare om Sammanslagningen, en tidsplan för utbetalning av fusionsvederlaget och hur svenska depåbevis som erhålls kan omvandlas till ett direkt innehav i den underliggande stamaktien i Aker BP som är noterad på Oslo Börs, finns tillgänglig på www.lundin-energy.com.

Ian Lundin, avgående Styrelseordförande för Lundin Energy kommenterar:
”Sedan Lundin Energy grundades för över två decennier sedan har bolaget växt till något som ingen av oss hade vågat drömma om, med ett aktievärde som ökat omkring 150 gånger och en genomsnittlig årlig avkastning till aktieägarna om 28 procent under de senaste 20 åren. Genom hårt arbete, uthållighet och framförallt en stark ledningsgrupp har bolaget utvecklats till ett ledande internationellt prospekterings- och produktionsbolag. Vi skriver nu ett nytt kapitel i bolagets historia, där sammanslagningen mellan Aker BP och Lundin Energys norska verksamhet bidrar till en fortsatt stark produktionstillväxt och hållbart växande utdelningar in i nästa decennium. Värdeskapande och långsiktig tillväxt är kärnan i Lundin Energys verksamhet och är vad hela denna sammanslagning handlar om.

Jag är övertygad om att den globala energiomställningen kommer att leda till unika investeringsmöjligheter och genom bildandet av Orrön Energy kommer vi att vara involverade i att ta tillvara på dessa möjligheter och skapa fortsatt aktieägarvärde. Jag skulle vilja tacka alla våra aktieägare för ert stöd under åren och jag ser mycket fram emot en ny era av värdeskapande – både i Aker BP och Orrön Energy.”

Nick Walker, avgående Koncernchef och vd för Lundin Energy kommenterar:
”Det gläder mig att kunna meddela att denna banbrytande transaktion med Aker BP nu har genomförts. Värdeskapande är grundbulten i vår verksamhet och denna sammanslagning utgör en unik möjlighet att skapa ett världsledande prospekterings- och produktionsbolag, med betydande storlek, produktionstillväxt och starkt fritt kassaflöde in i nästa decennium. Detta tillsammans med en verksamhet som har industriledande låga kostnader och koldioxidutsläpp.

Jag är övertygad om att sammanslagningen med Aker BP gynnar aktieägare i båda bolagen, då det skapar en verksamhet som är positionerad för tillväxt genom energiomställningen och levererar ökad och hållbar tillväxt. Jag ser även mycket fram emot att följa utvecklingen av Orrön Energy, som har en stark finansiell position med rätt bolagsledning och styrning på plats för att ta tillvara på de enorma möjligheter som skapas genom energiomställningen.

Jag skulle vilja tacka samtliga aktieägare för det oerhörda stöd ni visat under många år och våra anställda som genom sitt otroliga arbete skapat en fantastisk verksamhet. Slutligen skulle jag vilja rikta ett tack till styrelsen som konsekvent möjliggjort och stöttat bolagsledningen i vårt arbete för att uppnå detta.”

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:45:04+00:00,"Is EastGroup Properties (EGP) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""","Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.

In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.

However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.

EastGroup Properties (EGP) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.

Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this real estate investment trust a great growth pick right now.

Earnings Growth

Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.

While the historical EPS growth rate for EastGroup Properties is 8.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 9.3%.

Cash Flow Growth

Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.

Story continues

Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for EastGroup Properties is 26.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.6%.

While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 10.4% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.2%.

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions

Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for EastGroup Properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.

Bottom Line

While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made EastGroup Properties a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This combination positions EastGroup Properties well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.

In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.

However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.

Our proprietary system currently recommends Matson (MATX) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.

Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.

While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this ocean transportation and logistics services company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:

Earnings Growth

While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective.

Broadcasters, including BT Sport are looking to forge a media rights deal with UEFA, the governing body for professional football in Europe. The broadcasters will share coverage of UEFA's flagship Champions League competition and the Europa League and Europa Conference League. Also Read:This Analyst Explains Why He Sees Amazon's Cloud Unit Reaching A Valuation Of $3T, Netflix Rival Adds Live Sports To Its Streaming Bouquet The value of the three-year contract may jump by 20% year on year reaching €1.7 billion. The move reflects Amazon's readiness to bid for some of the most expensive sports rights to boost demand for its Prime Video platform, having pulled out of the race to stream Indian Premier League cricket matches. Amazon Prime already broadcasts live matches from the English Premier League and secured broadcast rights to most of France's most significant football competitions in 2021. For UEFA, the deal will boost its recently-expanded Champions League. A rival breakaway Super League backed by some of Europe's biggest football teams had threatened the Champions League in 2021. UEFA subsequently revamped the Champions League by increasing the number of teams and matches after the Super League fell due to severe backlash from fans and politicians. Amazon continues to diversify its revenue stream to beat the slowing e-commerce sales. Price Action: AMZN shares traded lower by 2.02% at $106.72 on the last check Thursday.

The job cuts added on to the tens of thousands of employees already axed by Chinese internet companies since late 2021 after the domestic regulatory crackdown crushed the sector. Latest layoffs have extended to the companies' core businesses following China's stringent Covid lockdown as opposed to the previous ones, which focused on restructuring loss-making industries and non-core segments. Tencent looks to cut employees across different business groups through the end of this year, extending to some core businesses, and will likely hit some senior managers. Tencent saw fewer title approvals from the government and chased games with big budgets. ByteDance's latest layoffs hit its videogame business, once a promising growth area, and 3,000 additional people from its education unit. Chinese video-streaming platform Bilibili Inc (NASDAQ: BILI) slashed staff from some core business segments like videogame and live-streaming.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:36:33+00:00,"UPDATE 2-Nikola pushes shareholder meeting, seeks investor approval to increase shares","(Adds background)

June 30 (Reuters) - Nikola Corp on Thursday adjourned its shareholder meeting for the second time this month, moving it to July 18 to allow more time to get shareholder approval to raise the number of shares outstanding in the electric vehicle maker.

The meeting was first adjourned on June 1 after the Chairman Stephen Girsky urged voters to authorize an increase in shares by 200 million to 800 million.

The company said 48% of all outstanding shares have been voted in favor of the proposal, still 2% short for it to pass. Over 112 million shares have not yet been voted on, it added.

Nikola said that the increase in the total shares would provide flexibility to support the growth of the business.

Founder and former Chief Executive and Chairman, Trevor Milton, on June 1 voted against the proposal, according to a Bloomberg News report.

Under the draft rules, companies collecting personal data would be responsible for the legality, legitimacy, the need for the data, scope, and security of overseas transfers. The draft also covers methods of handling personal information by domestic processors and overseas recipients. Lately, China has emphasized the risks to national security inherent in transferring user data overseas. The draft rules aim to bolster a data security law implemented last year September. Organizations also require approval for cross-border transfer of core and essential data via a unique mechanism. Companies ranging from Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), Baidu, Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU), and JD.com, Inc (NASDAQ: JD) collect troves of user data. The app of online recruitment services company Kanzhun Ltd (NASDAQ: BZ) and two apps of the logistics platform Full Truck Alliance Co Ltd (NYSE: YMM) resumed new user registrations. The apps were under review by China's cyberspace regulator. The Chinese government recently expressed support for the domestic tech industry, which had been undergoing intense scrutiny. Price Action: BABA shares traded lower by 1.41% at $114.39 on the last check Thursday.

June 30 (Reuters) - Novartis prefers a spinoff of its generic drug unit over a potential sale to private equity firms, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

A challenging macro environment for leveraged buyouts has made the sale route difficult and Novartis sees a separate listing of the Sandoz business as more likely, the report said. (https://bloom.bg/3yt7Iu2)

The Swiss pharmaceutical group in October said it had started a strategic review of the Sandoz unit as price pressures mounted in the off-patent drug sector.

On Thursday, Novartis reiterated its previous statement that ""the strategic review is ongoing, all options remain on the table and the company plans to provide an update before the end of the year"".

Investing.com -- Micron (NASDAQ:MU) reported Thursday mixed-quarter results and softer guidance that pointed to a gloomy backdrop ahead for the chipmaker as excess inventories and slower spending on consumer electronics hurt demand.

Micron shares fell about 2% in after-hours trading following the report.

Micron announced earnings per share of $2.59 on revenue of $8.64 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.46 on revenue of $8.68 billion.

The backdrop for chipmakers including Micron has deteriorated sharply this year as demand for consumer electronics has been rocked by supply-chain disruptions, geopolitics and surging inflation.

Global shipments of total devices including PCs, tablets and mobile phones are on pace to decline 7.6% in 2022, according to the data released Thursday from technology research firm Gartner.

Noting the ""weakened"" demand environment, Micron said it was taking action to moderate its supply growth in fiscal 2023.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, Micron sees EPS in a range of $1.43 and $1.83 on revenue of $7.2 billion, give or take 400 million. Wall Street consensus had called for EPS of $2.69 on revenue of $9.31 billion.

Democrats Weigh Paring Biden Tax Hike to Win Over Manchin Trump’s Final Scene Didn’t Go According to Script Venice Plans to Start Weeding Out Cheap Tourists Bonds Rally on Recession Fears; Stocks Fluctuate: Markets Wrap Fauci Suffers Covid Symptom Rebound After Course of Pfizer’s Paxlovid

The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index has slumped 33%, set for its worst first half of the year on record in a market strained by rising costs and surging interest rates. The group is the biggest loser on the S&P 500 Index as recession concerns weigh on shoppers’ spending decisions. Adding to that wall of worry, US consumer spending fell in May for the first time this year, signaling a cooling economy that’s on weaker footing.

“As consumers continue to pull in their horns, I think that these stocks can go lower,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.

The rout this year was laid bare in the quarterly earnings season when companies from Walmart Inc. to Target Corp. cut their annual profit forecasts. This week, RH became the latest retailer to temper investors’ expectations for the year, while Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. released a lackluster earnings report showing quarterly sales fell even more than anticipated.

Part of the problem is that stores are awash in products that consumers don’t want. At the same time, companies are grappling with surging fuel and labor expenses, and the challenge to pass on those costs to consumers.

Etsy Inc. is the biggest decliner in the consumer discretionary index so far in 2022, plunging 66% as the boost in online sales from the Covid-19 pandemic fades. Other top decliners include Bath & Body Works Inc., Caesars Entertainment Inc. and Carnival Corp.

Story continues

The only stocks in the 58-member index set to notch gains for the first half of the year are Dollar Tree Inc., Dollar General Corp. and AutoZone Inc. They are up about 11%, 4% and 3% this year, respectively.

The pair of deep-discount retailers reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results last month, with consumers beginning to trade down to less expensive products. Meanwhile, AutoZone has advanced as analysts from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded their recommendations on shares, touting the largely non-discretionary nature of auto-part sales.

In Sea of Red, Three Consumer Stocks Are Glowing Green: Chart

Despite being the worst performing group on the S&P 500, consumer discretionary stocks still aren’t cheap, trading at around 20 times projected earnings, while the benchmark has an earnings multiple of 16.

“The derating in consumer discretionary has been major, but I still don’t think it’s trading at a reasonable enough valuation to make it worth dipping your toe into that pool just yet,” Jonathan Mackay, Schroders investment strategist, said earlier this week.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:30:00+00:00,‘We are in a recession’: Long-time bull Cathie Wood warns investors about the ‘big problem’ in the economy. Here’s what she likes today,"‘We are in a recession’: Long-time bull Cathie Wood warns investors about the ‘big problem’ in the economy. Here’s what she likes today

The official GDP estimate for Q2 won’t be available until later next month, but many experts – including Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood – are calling for a recession.

“We think we are in a recession,” Wood says in a recent CNBC interview.

“We think a big problem out there is inventories — the increase of which I’ve never seen this large in my career. I’ve been around for 45 years.”

Based on how markets are doing, sentiment is certainly bearish. The S&P 500 is down 20% year to date. Wood’s flagship fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) tumbled by more than 50% during the same period.

But investors are not giving up. CNBC noted Fact Set data showing that ARKK saw over $180 million in inflows in June.

“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based benchmarks like the Nasdaq 100,” says Wood. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation. Innovation solves problems.”

For those who share Wood’s vision, here’s a look at the top three holdings at ARKK.

Zoom Video Communications (ZM)

When meetings and classes moved online due to the pandemic, Zoom’s business flourished.

But as the economy reopened and employees started going back to the office, there have been concerns about the growth potential of this video communications company.

Year to date, Zoom shares have fallen 42%.

But Wood continues to see opportunity in the stock. In fact, Zoom is currently the largest holding at ARKK, accounting for 10.1% of the fund’s weight.

Earlier this month, Ark Invest released a research report showing how Zoom shares could see a glorious revival in the not-too-distant future.

“According to ARK’s open-source research and model, Zoom’s share price could approach $1,500, compounding at a 76% annual growth rate, in 2026,” Wood’s team wrote.

Story continues

Since Zoom shares trade at around $106 a piece right now, that price target implies a potential upside of over 1,300%.

Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla has long been a staple for growth investors. But now, it’s also a name worth considering for contrarian investors – given how much the stock has pulled back.

Since reaching a closing high of $1,229.91 on Nov. 4, the stock has fallen by a staggering 46%.

But business remains on the right track. In Q1, deliveries of the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y totaled 310,048 vehicles, up 68% year over year.

Ark Invest also sees a gaming-changing product coming for the company — robotaxi.

“Tesla’s prospective robotaxi business line is a key driver, contributing 60% of expected value and more than half of expected EBITDA in 2026,” wrote Ark analyst Tasha Keeney in a report in April.

In that report, Ark expects a share price of $4,600 for Tesla by 2026. That represents a potential upside of over 590% from where the stock sits today.

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Tesla is the second-largest holding at ARKK with an 8.6% weight.

Roku (ROKU)

The secular trend of on-demand video streaming has created several winners in the tech space.

Roku is one of them. Since going public in September 2017, the stock has returned more than 200%.

The company’s platform gives users access to streaming services such as Youtube, Netflix, and Disney+. Roku also offers its own ad-supported channels featuring licensed third-party content.

The company added 1.1 million active accounts in Q1, bringing its total active accounts to 61.3 million. Revenue rose 28% year over year to $734 million.

Although Roku’s business is growing, investors have been bailing in rapid fashion. The stock is down a staggering 82% over the past 12 months.

But Ark Invest is not giving up on Roku. In fact, Roku remains the third-largest holding at ARKK, accounting for 8.4% of the fund’s weight.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:30:00+00:00,Associa Continues Partnership With Patriot PAWS In Support Of Disabled Veterans,"DALLAS, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Associa, the community management industry’s largest company, continues to support disabled Veterans across the country through its partnership with Patriot PAWS’ Service Dog awareness initiative.

In March 2021, Associa initiated its sponsorship of Scout, a Patriot PAWS Service Dog in training.  Associa continues to follow Scout’s progress as the now 18-month-old Labrador Retriever pursues his journey to become the Service Dog partner of a disabled Veteran facing physical and emotional injuries. Scout currently works with a Puppy Raiser at Texas A&M University as a part of Patriot PAWS’ satellite program. Puppy Raisers in this program assist in raising and socializing program dogs during the first year of their training. Most recently, Scout has been working with his trainer to practice impulse control and duration stays during outings to restaurants, stores, and other public locations.

In addition to financing the training of Scout, Associa continues to lead a social media campaign focused on creating awareness of the vital role service animals play for the Veterans they assist. Associa and Patriot PAWS work together to share facts about the training process and cost of service animals, laws protecting Service Dogs and their handlers, and the role that these animals play in communities throughout North America.

“It takes upwards of two and a half years and $35,000 to train a Patriot PAWS Service Dog. Because of companies like Associa being generous enough to sponsor pups like Scout, Patriot PAWS is able to continue on our mission to place high-quality Service Dogs in the hands of our nation’s Veterans,” stated Executive Director and Founder, Lori Stevens. “Lives are changed by these partnerships, and we cannot thank Associa enough for helping us do that.”

“Since we began our partnership with Patriot PAWS over a year ago, we have been so invested in Scout’s progress and learning about the impact he will make on his future Veteran companion,” stated Andrew Fortin, senior vice president of external affairs. “The Associa team has a passion for serving community members in need, and this certainly extends to the Veterans who have so selflessly served our country. We are honored to shine a light on the work of Patriot PAWS and will continue to increase awareness about dogs like Scout as we follow his training journey.”

About Associa Partner Company

The mission of Patriot PAWS is to train and provide Service Dogs of the highest quality at no cost to disabled American Veterans and others with mobile disabilities in order to help restore their physical and emotional independence. Patriot PAWS also trains Service Dogs to assist with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress (PTS) as these are additional disabilities that Veterans commonly suffer from. Founded by professional dog trainer, Lori Stevens, Patriot PAWS has placed more than 360 Service Dogs since 2006, when it was designated as an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  Patriot PAWS trains their dogs with the help of volunteer Puppy Raisers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and student Puppy Raisers at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. They also have an innovative, 13-year partnership with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice where Inmate Trainers live and work with the dogs in prison.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:30:00+00:00,"CPABC: Vancouver Island population growth rebounded in 2021, while low housing supply pushing prices up","DUNCAN, British Columbia, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to BC Check-Up: Live, an annual report by the Chartered Professional Accountants of British Columbia (CPABC) on demographic and affordability trends across the province, Vancouver Island and Coast (excluding the Capital Regional District) added 5,466 new residents in 2021, bringing the total population to 461,520 residents.

“Like for the rest of the province, the pace of population growth slowed across Vancouver Island in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted migration patterns,” said Woody Hayes, FCPA, FCA. “That slowdown appears to have been short-lived, with a rebound underway as the region attracts a growing number of residents from other parts of the country.”

The region’s population grew by 5.2 per cent between 2017 and 2021, averaging nearly 6,000 new residents per year over the period. While international migration remained down in 2021, the region gained a net of 3,928 new residents from other provinces, and 3,981 from other parts of the province. Natural growth rate (births minus mortalities) continued to offset population growth, with mortalities nearly 2,300 higher than births in 2021.

“Welcoming new residents to Vancouver Island is critical as our population continues to age, with a quarter of our population aged 65 years or older,” continued Hayes. “As more people retire, the significant labour shortages we are already facing will only worsen if we do not attract new residents.”

Vancouver Island’s average age was 45.9 in 2021, well above the 42.8 provincial average, and up by 2.1 years compared to 2011. Over a quarter (25.3 per cent) of the region’s population was aged 65 or older in 2021, compared to less than a fifth (19.5 per cent) in 2011.

“At one point, our region’s housing prices were attractive for potential immigrants and those looking to start a family,” noted Hayes. “However, that comparative advantage has weakened as housing prices have grown across the Island, and buying power has further eroded with recent interest rate increases. And while housing construction has been robust, it has lagged population growth.”

Across Vancouver Island, the average single-family home sold for $855,300 in May 2022, up from $656,800 in May 2021 (+30.2 per cent) and $518,600 in May 2020 (+64.9 per cent). The average price for an apartment sold in May 2022 was $446,100, up by 36.2 per cent from May 2021 and 61.2 per cent from May 2020.

Over the past five years, Vancouver Island and Coast’s (excluding the Capital Regional District) population grew by almost 30,000, compared to about 11,500 residential units completed over the same period. The 2,503 units completed in 2021 was down from the record of 2,898 in 2020, but above the 1,728 average from 2010 to 2019.

“While there has been inadequate supply growth, there was an uptick in developments in 2020 and 2021,” concluded Hayes. “However, this uptick was primarily smaller attached units, while demand has been far stronger for larger units. Our region needs to further encourage housing development to improve affordability, and ensure that we are promoting policies which boost our economic outlook and income of residents. We also need to minimize cost increases from new regulations, such as from requiring deconstruction of old stock prior to a new build.”

Apollo/Lumen Transaction on Track to Close in Early Fourth Quarter 2022

SAN JOSE, Calif., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calix, Inc. (NYSE: CALX) today announced that AcenTek is using energy-efficient Calix end-to-end platforms to reduce network power consumption 73 percent while saving subscribers 50 percent on home Wi-Fi network energy usage. A Calix customer since 2005, AcenTek is the primary broadband service provider (BSP) for its rural communities in Michigan, Minnesota, and Iowa. To support its transition from copper to more environmentally friendly fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) AcenTek embraced the Calix Intelligent Access EDGE™ platform. With the Intelligent Access EDGE E9-2 (E9-2), AcenTek streamlined the access network and consolidated functions to eliminate legacy Broadband Network Gateways (BNG) routers and DHCP Servers —reducing energy usage by 73 percent. Additionally, the Network Innovation Platform E7-2 (E7-2) enabled AcenTek to eliminate hundreds of remote cabinets and outdated DSL to achieve an 85 percent reduction in power usage. Finally, by putting GigaSpire® BLAST systems, part of the Revenue EDGE™ platform, in subscribers’ homes, AcenTek provides whole-home Wi-Fi coverage with a single gateway. More than 90 percent of AcenTek subscribers with a GigaSpire BLAST have experienced a greater than 50 percent drop in home system power usage versus competitive mesh-dependent solutions. By leading the way on sustainability, AcenTek is simplifying its business, enhancing its value proposition, and proving it truly cares about its communities.

AcenTek’s green strategy leverages the Intelligent Access EDGE and Revenue EDGE platforms to optimize power savings. As a result, AcenTek can:

Reduce energy consumption in the access network by 73 percent. AcenTek used the Network Innovation Platform’s advanced routing module (ARm) and subscriber management module (SMm) to consolidate functions within the E9-2 system and deployed the Aggregation Service Manager card (ASM). This caused energy consumption in the network to plummet by 73 percent.

Reduce energy consumption 85 percent by eliminating high-power remote cabinets and outdated DSL systems. AcenTek also vastly reduced energy consumption and eliminated non-environmentally friendly copper. They did so by upgrading subscribers across their network from DSL to the fiber-based E7-2. This upgrade enabled AcenTek to remove 113 remote cabinets and DSL systems and replace them with as few as 10 central office-based E7-2 systems. Ultimately, this upgrade reduced network energy consumption an additional 85 percent.

Enable 50 percent energy savings on the subscriber’s home systems using GigaSpire BLAST in Revenue EDGE. AcenTek has launched the Calix GigaSpire BLAST system, part of the Revenue EDGE platform, to deliver managed Wi-Fi services to subscribers. This also delivers energy benefits. A single GigaSpire BLAST provides complete, whole-home Wi-Fi coverage in more than 90 percent of AcenTek subscriber homes that have it. This eliminates the need for additional energy-consuming hardware such as mesh units or pods and reduces home system energy consumption by more than 50 percent.

""After 17 years of partnership, Calix continues to be an invaluable guide as we drive to fulfill our green power initiative,"" said Ethan Webinger, chief operating officer at AcenTek. ""We’ve reduced our core routing power footprint by 73 percent by eliminating routing systems with the Intelligent Access EDGE E9-2 system. We’ve also increased network capacity and simplified operations and management as a result of deploying the Network Innovation Platform on all our systems. Calix is the only company that consistently delivers innovative, end-to-end broadband solutions like these to rural communities like ours, who are generally overlooked by the industry giants. Calix green innovations will enable us to continue to grow our value in our communities.""

AcenTek began in 1950 as the Fillmore County Telephone Cooperative, formed by a group of farmers determined to improve rural telephone service in rural Minnesota. Today, AcenTek (""Ascending Technology"") brings broadband innovation and transformation to 25,000 subscribers in 33 communities.

""Calix is changing the game with arguably the world’s greenest broadband network architecture thanks to over a billion dollars of investment in the platform that lets a broadband service provider use a single system to consolidate the Broadband Network Gateways (BNG), Aggregation Router and Switch, Lawful Intercept, and DHCP Server,"" said Michael Weening, president and chief operating officer at Calix. ""At the same time, that simplicity makes it the easiest to operate in the world which leads to lower people costs, higher margins and greater operational reliability. Community-focused BSPs that are investing in their region with high-speed fiber broadband can also contribute to the health of their community. How? By being green, they demonstrate their commitment to sustainability while establishing themselves as community leaders. That is the power of innovation and partnerships.""

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:29:41+00:00,ESG’s Regulatory ‘Shakeout’ Could Benefit Sector’s Do-Good Funds,"(Bloomberg) -- ESG investment strategies are being probed for deceptive labeling, criticized for excluding firms like Tesla Inc. and questioned as to whether they actually work. All this, some sustainable fund managers said, could be a good thing.

Tough scrutiny of loosely-regulated funds with higher environmental, social and governance standards could help the industry, these managers said. Investors would welcome better ESG definitions, greater transparency and easier ways to find funds that match their own goals.

“I do think the silver lining is more product innovation rather than just saying, ‘oh, ESG leaders,’” said Todd Sohn, a technical analyst at Strategas Securities. “Let’s focus on minority leadership and other large scale, community-type opportunities that are out there,” like the Impact Shares YWCA Women’s Empowerment ETF (ticker WOMN).

Governments are stepping up investigations into ESG claims. The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s ESG funds failed to meet their promised metrics. Deutsche Bank AG’s Frankfurt offices were raided by police in May over accusations of “greenwashing,” or overstating ESG capabilities.

Tesla’s removal from the ESG version of the S&P 500 Index sparked a debate about which companies do — and don’t — pass muster with socially aware investors. And some critics say environment-focused funds may not even be working, since global emissions continue to rise.

As questions swirled around ESG, the sector’s exchange-traded funds saw record outflows in May, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.

AXS Investments’ Greg Bassuk said this means investors have learned not to blindly “flock to the next big thing.”

Story continues

“It’s not a lack of performance or not delivering on what the products are designed to do, but the lack of education and a mismatch in investor expectations with outcomes.” Bassuk, chief executive officer at AXS, said by phone.

Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at Moneta, said that questions about ESG -- an acronym coined in the mid 2000s -- are to be expected for a still-evolving investment category.

“There will naturally be exaggeration, marketing hypes, overpromising, underdelivering. That’s going to be the nature of it. There’s been a lot of criticism of the whole category of ESG,” Devitt said by phone. “That is just an inevitable fallout or kind of a collateral damage when you have a massive transformational change in the industry like this.”

Lisa Langley, chief executive officer of Emerge Canada, expects that ESG flows will eventually stabilize.

“All of this is actually a healthy shakeout,” she said. “The outflows don’t really flip me out because we’ve seen outflows in the industry more generally, and it is possible that you don’t have to sacrifice performance. Communicating that message is going to give more energy into this space.”

Data from RBC Capital Markets show that year-to-date, companies with better ESG risk scores have outperformed those with worse ESG risk scores within both the S&P 500 and S&P Europe 350 indexes as of June 9.

“Flows have not been as bad as the term ‘reckoning’ would imply,” Sara Mahaffy, ESG strategist for RBC Capital management, said by phone. “They have eased back from highs, but you’re still seeing inflows.”

RBC also found that while sustainable fund flows have fallen from their peaks, inflows still continue and, in fact, outperform their traditional counterparts. Some of that could be due to weaker performance and investor preference of value funds at the start of the year, Mahaffy said. “We also think some of the trend is reflecting a general easing that we’ve seen in equity fund flows,” she added.

Many fund managers welcome proposed SEC regulations that would prevent money managers from misleading investors on ESG investments.

“This could allow investors to make more apples-to-apples comparisons, which is pretty much impossible now,” said Amrita Nandakumar, president at Vident Investment Advisory.

More transparency could also help investors understand what is and isn’t ESG. The Tesla incident was “the perfect example for why it’s complicated,” Jake Jolly, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon, said at Bloomberg’s New York office.

“It’s not, ‘oh, just take everybody like deals with crude oil, throw them out and then keep everybody that’s electric,’” he added. “It’s complicated.”

In fact, RBC found that ESG money managers have grown more accepting of fossil-fuel names. The firm found that inclusion of fossil fuel and energy companies in US sustainable funds climbed 0.6% and 0.5% from the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.

Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF, said the energy-centric additions to sustainable funds reflect a growing appetite for ESG improvers. “The thought process is that an oil major that is working towards a climate goal and changing its business model will make a bigger decarbonization impact than a tech company that is already sustainable,” he said.

And greater investor education has finally helped point buyers toward opportunities beyond their old favorites, wind and solar. “One area where the inflows have been picking up this year have been for the sustainable agriculture and food-focused funds,” RBC’s Mahaffy said.

* S&P 500 headed for worst first-half since 1970

* Indexes down: Dow 0.72%, S&P 0.58%, Nasdaq 0.81% (Adds comments, updates prices to early afternoon)

By Shreyashi Sanyal and Amruta Khandekar

June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Thursday, setting the Dow up for its worst first six months since 1962, on concerns that a dogged pursuit by central banks to tame inflation would hamper global economic growth.

Fears over slowing growth and surging prices have rippled through markets, with recession worries taking center stage as monetary policymakers across the world look to aggressively raise borrowing costs.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday vowed to not let the U.S. economy slip into a ""higher inflation regime"", even if it means raising interest rates to levels that put growth at risk.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite came off session lows but was still set for its largest declines ever for the first-half, while the benchmark S&P 500 tracked its biggest January-June percentage drop since 1970.

All the three main indexes are on course to post their second straight quarterly declines for the first time since 2015.

Fed policymakers in recent days have set expectations for a second 75-basis points interest rate hike in July even as economic data painted a dour picture of the American consumer.

""Until inflation meaningfully rolls over which at this point will take, I believe months, it's going to be hard for the market to really find a bottom and begin a rally,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.

Meanwhile, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose less than expected in May, indicating a tepid rebound in growth in the second quarter, while inflation maintained its upward trend.

Story continues

""A lot of investors were expecting inflation data to really start to come down. But what we're finding is that it's a lot more challenging, and that the inflation data is remaining elevated for longer and probably has not peaked,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

Large-cap growth stocks including Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Tesla Inc fell between 0.5% and 2%, leading declines for the day.

At 12:01 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 224.38 points, or 0.72%, at 30,804.93, the S&P 500 was down 22.26 points, or 0.58%, at 3,796.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 90.17 points, or 0.81%, at 11,087.72.

Heading into the second half of the year, bruised markets will continue to focus on inflation, unemployment and interest rate increases along with their impact on corporate earnings.

""There's a sense that the earnings picture is going to be the next shoe to drop and that downward revisions to earnings will catalyze another leg lower in the market,"" Baird's Mayfield said.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc fell 4.5% as the drugstore chain maintained its full-year earnings forecast due to declining COVID vaccinations.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and 42 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 11 new highs and 332 new lows.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:27:40+00:00,"Here's What Sterling Infrastructure, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:STRL) Shareholder Ownership Structure Looks Like","The big shareholder groups in Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) have power over the company. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

Sterling Infrastructure is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$654m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Sterling Infrastructure.

View our latest analysis for Sterling Infrastructure  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sterling Infrastructure?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

We can see that Sterling Infrastructure does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sterling Infrastructure, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sterling Infrastructure. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.6% of shares outstanding. With 4.8% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Joseph Cutillo, the CEO has 2.3% of the shares allocated to their name.

Story continues

After doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track.

Insider Ownership Of Sterling Infrastructure

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can see that insiders own shares in Sterling Infrastructure, Inc.. In their own names, insiders own US$28m worth of stock in the US$654m company. This shows at least some alignment. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 3 warning signs  with Sterling Infrastructure , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:26:14+00:00,2 “Strong Buy” Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,"The current market conditions – the NASDAQ is down 29% year-to-date, and the S&P 500 is down 21% – offer bargain hunters a target-rich environment. Plenty of sound stocks have seen their prices decline, pulled down by the general market headwinds and the overall stock trend, to levels that have left them too cheap to ignore.

At this level, investors can find the benefits of cheap stocks, which offer both learning opportunities and strong upside potential. However, in evaluating stocks to buy, it is important to look at more than just the price.

Wall Street’s analysts are taking note, and are looking for the ‘Strong Buys’ among the market’s cheapest stocks. Some of their picks make interesting reading, and we’ve opened up the database at TipRanks to pull up the details on two of these stocks. Let's take a closer look.

Azek Company (AZEK)

First on our list today is Azek, a company in the outdoor life niche. Azek manufactures decking and home exterior siding products, and in a unique twist, the company sources its building materials from providers of 100% recycled materials. Azek boasts of the ‘green’ nature of its business, and how it can potentially recycle 500 million pounds of waste and scrap materials annually. The company products are not only sustainably sourced, but also long-lasting – and capable of replacing traditional wooden home siding.

Azek presents investors with an interesting case to follow. Some recent data (declines in new home showings, for example) have indicated that the US real estate market is slowing down – but home improvement is a lagging indicator for that, and Azek reported strong results in its financial release for Q2 of fiscal year 2022. The quarter, which ended on March 31, showed $393.3 million at the top line, up 35% year-over-year – and the best top line result in over two years. The company adjusted net income jumped 29% y/y, to reach $50.8 million, and translated into a 33-cent adjusted diluted EPS, up 32% from the year-ago quarter.

Story continues

Despite the overall positive results of the company’s recent performance, shares in AZEK are down 63% since the start of this year. However, Truist 5-star analyst Keith Hughes sees the fall in share price as an opportunity to get in on this stock.

“We believe the stock continues to price in a far worse downturn than is most likely realistically realized. The secular growth story remains unquestioned, and we believe that composite decking will retain price even in a weak demand scenario regardless of capacity adds in industry. We believe this point is a significant hurdle for many investors and realization could be a substantial AZEK catalyst at some point,” Hughes opined.

Hughes’ upbeat outlook informs his Buy rating on the shares, and his $30 price target implies a 12-month upside potential of 78%. (To watch Hughes’ track record, click here)

With 17 recent analyst reviews on record, this construction contractor firm has picked up plenty of attention – and the bulk is positive. The reviews break down 16 to 1 in favor of Buys over Hold, and support the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $16.86 and have an average target of $26.93, indicating room for ~60% growth ahead. (See AZEK stock forecast on TipRanks)

Cars.com (CARS)

Now we’ll switch gears to Cars.com, one of the tech world’s truly durable names. This company got its start in 1998, as part of the late-90s dot.com bubble, and it survived the crash that followed when the bubble burst. Cars.com, which has since emerged as one of the leaders in the online automotive digital marketplace, gives car buyers the resources, data, and digital tools they need to navigate the car dealers and find the right vehicle at the right price.

Cars.com boasts a $692 million market cap today, along with more than $620 million in annual revenues and $189 million in annual adjusted income. The cars.com website had 592 million visits last year, 25.1 million monthly active users, and the company’s network included over 19,000 auto dealers. Cars.com, in its most recent quarter, 1Q22, showed top line sales of $158.2 million, in line with last six quarterly results. EPS slipped by 25% year-over-year, from 8 cents to 6 cents.

The company saw a decline in cash flow y/y, with free cash flow dropping from $44.1 million in 1Q21 to $26.4 million in 1Q22. Management attributed the decline mainly to a one-time tax refund received last year, of $9.1 million. Looking ahead to Q2, Cars.com is expected revenue to reach the range of $161 million to $163 million; at the midpoint, this would provide y/y growth of 5%.

CARS stock is down 42% so far this year. That can be attributed, in part, to the general market downturn. However, the drop in share price has not deterred Craig-Hallum’s 5-star analyst Steve Dyer from taking an optimistic view of the stock.

“Trading at 7x EBITDA with a double-digit FCF yield, we believe CARS represents an attractive way to play a gradual rebound in auto sales through this year and next. CARS is one of two broad-based marketplaces that continues to add services and functionality for dealers, who continue to move their marketing spend on-line. Given these tailwinds, we like the CARS risk/reward going forward,” Dyer wrote.

Dyer’s view backs up his Buy rating on the shares, and his $17 price target suggests it has a 82% upside to look forward to. (To watch Dyer’s track record, click here)

While Cars.com may be a holdout from the 90s, Wall Street still likes it. The stock has a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 4 positive reviews set in recent weeks. The shares are trading for $9.33 and their $19.25 average price target implies a one-year gain of ~106%. (See CARS stock forecast on TipRanks)

Amazon shares have significantly lagged the broader market lately, with the stock down -37.4% in the year-to-date period vs. -20.3% decline for the S&P 500 index. Amazon has missed top-line estimates in each of the last four quarters, as growth has decelerated in the post-pandemic period. Rising costs and over-capacity also appear to be headwinds. That said, Amazon remains the undisputed leader in ecommerce and cloud computing. Gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Further, strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.

Also, growing momentum across Amazon Music is contributing well. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Also, expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Further, robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. Additionally, the company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.

Accenture shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Consulting Services industry over the past year (-4.0% vs. -2.5%).

While Accenture is faced with a number of near-term challenges like increased competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, and exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as a result of its global status, it has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses. The company has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships. The company’s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential.

Comcast shares have declined -29.7% over the past year against Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -31.5%. The company is persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern. However, Comcast is benefiting from strength in broadband subscriber base and strong momentum in the wireless business.

The company’s strategy to provide high-speed Internet at an affordable price plays a pivotal role in providing connectivity and improving customer experience. Moreover, COVID-led increased media consumption and the work-from-home and online-learning waves bode well for Comcast’s Internet business. The company’s streaming service Peacock gained significant traction within a short span and is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.

Per the Zacks analyst, Children's Place's gross margin has been hit by higher inbound transportation costs and deleverage of fixed costs due to lower net sales. It expects margin to be under pressure.

High Costs, Concentration Risk Hurt Federated (FHI)
Per the Zacks analyst, rising expenses due to increased distribution expenses and expansion measures hurt Federated's financials. Investment advisory fees, as a key source of revenues, are worrisome.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:25:00+00:00,Cinedigm's SCREAMBOX and Bloody Disgusting Acquire Hotly Anticipated Slasher Sequel 'Terrifier 2',"A nationwide theatrical release is planned for this fall; Followed by an exclusive launch on streaming platform SCREAMBOX

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 30, 2022 / Streaming platform SCREAMBOX announced today they have partnered with horror media brand Bloody Disgusting to acquire all North American rights to the highly anticipated Terrifier 2. Cinedigm Corp., Thursday, June 30, 2022, Press release picture Cinedigm Corp., Thursday, June 30, 2022, Press release picture

The ultra-gory slasher will open in theaters Nationwide this Halloween season before streaming exclusively on the Bloody Disgusting-powered SCREAMBOX.

From Writer/Director Damien Leone (All Hallows' Eve), the highly anticipated sequel to the cult-favorite slasher film welcomes back David Howard Thornton as the demonic killer, Art the Clown. Terrifier 2 also introduces Lauren LaVera as Sienna, who will become an instant fan favorite. Also returning is Samantha Scaffidi who will reprise her role as Victoria Heyes. Horror icon Felissa Rose (Sleepaway Camp) also makes an appearance.

Terrifier 2 has Art the Clown up to his old tricks once again. Following his gruesome demise in the first film, a sinister presence has brought Art back to life to rein terror on the residents of Miles County. On Halloween night, he returns to the unassuming town and sets his sights on fresh prey: a teenage girl and her little brother, portrayed by LaVera and Elliott Fullam, respectively.

The film marks the fifth on-screen appearance of Art the Clown. Originally created for a pair of low-budget, bloody shorts, the character made his feature-length debut in Leone's 2013 hit All Hallows' Eve. His iconic look, plus the personality and humor he exudes, changed the way we look at killer clowns forever. The sadistic clown went on to become a cult-horror icon with various pop culture merchandise companies selling masks, costumes, enamel pins, air fresheners, figurines, and even ugly Christmas sweaters.

""The Terrifier franchise embodies everything that's great about the iconic slasher flicks of the 80s and 90s,"" said Bloody Disgusting and SCREAMBOX Managing Director Brad Miska. ""It's nostalgic, it's dark, it's bloody, so it's no wonder the movie-and especially Art the Clown-have become a staple for horror and Halloween fans alike. Fans are not prepared for what they're about to experience.""

Story continues

Says Director Damien Leone, ""Just like our incredible fan base, Bloody Disgusting immediately recognized the film's franchise potential and acknowledged Art the Clown as a new and formidable presence in the genre. It was encouraging to find the perfect home for our batshit crazy, no holds barred, balls-to-the-wall horror film after three arduous years of production, a global pandemic and endless gallons of blood. Our goal was to create a horror film that was boundary-pushing, fresh yet old-school and demented as hell. You know...a film you can take the kids to!We are thrilled to finally answer that once dreaded question...'So, when does Terrifier 2 come out?!'""

Terrifier 2 is developed by Dark Age Cinema and Fuzz on the Lens Productions and features an original score by Rostislav Vaynshtok and Paul Wiley. The film is produced by Phil Falcone, Steven Della Salla, Jason Leavy and Michael Leavy. Executive producers include Cairo Ben Amen II, Joshua Anderson, Steven Caruso, Lisa Falcone, Hank Greenberg, Marcus McGill and Thomas Smith. The deal was negotiated by Brandon Hill on behalf of Screambox & Bloody Disgusting and Priscilla Ross Smith of The Coven on behalf of the filmmakers.

After the film's planned theatrical release, Terrifier 2 will debut on SCREAMBOX. Powered by Bloody Disgusting, the horror streaming channel features a broad mix of content for casual and die-hard horror fans alike. Refreshed monthly with films and episodes delivering every type of terror imaginable, SCREAMBOX currently features classic horror films like Slumber Party Massacre and the original House on Haunted Hill, as well as horror series such as ""The Island"" and the iconic 80s horror series ""Freddy's Nightmares,"" an anthology series based on A Nightmare on Elm Street.

About:

Established in 2011 by Truffle Capital, Carbios is a green chemistry company, developing biological and innovative processes. Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics, Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution.

Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles, trays, textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation, the first of its kind in the world, was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.

In 2017, Carbios and L’Oréal co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development, Nestlé Waters, PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019.

The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions, integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:22:50+00:00,Alphabet Stock is the Best FAANG To Own Next Month,"Inflation and recession speculation has gripped Wall Street for much of 2022, and the broader market's selloff has undeniably underscored investors' fears. The S&P 500 (SPX) has been no stranger to the volatility, sitting roughly 20% lower year-to-date and on track for its worst first half of the year performance in more than five decades. This tumultuous environment has weighed on some of the index's most prominent members -- FAANG stocks. Each member of the Big Tech collective sports double-digit losses at the year's halfway point. However, one in the bunch looks poised for a temporary respite: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Digging deeper, seasonality suggests the shares of Google's parent company could jump next month, per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Alphabet stock just landed on White's list of the best performing stocks on the SPX in July, going back 10 years. In fact, the security saw positive monthly returns during this time period nine out of ten times, boasting an 8.9% pop on average, edging out Apple (AAPL) as the best FAANG stock to own next month.

Today, GOOGL is off 2.4% at $2,192.03, but a move similar to the one in White's study would put it at $2,387.12 by the end of the month -- an area not seen since May 5. It would also help the equity topple its 60-day moving average, which has loomed overhead since early April and rejected a late-June rally. Year-to-date, Alphabet stock is down 24.4%. GOOGL Chart June 30

An unwinding of pessimism in the options pits could help put some wind at the security's back. This is due to the fact that Alphabet stock's 50-day put/call volume ratio at the  International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) stands higher than 94% of readings from the past 12 months -- indicating a clear preference for bearish bets.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-best-faang-own-162250006.html,"['ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US']"
AAPL,2022-06-30T16:22:29+00:00,Stock Market Today: Dow in Worst Quarterly Loss Since 2020 on Recession Fears,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow on Thursday wrapped up the second quarter of the year with its biggest quarterly loss in two years as the latest economic data flagging a wobble in the consumer exacerbated fears of a recession at a time when the Federal Reserve is hellbent on bringing inflation down.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.80%, or 249 points, suffering its worst quarter since Q1 2020. The Nasdaq was down 1.3%. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% posting its biggest first-half loss since 1970.

Energy led the broader market lower under pressure from falling oil prices after OPEC and its allies including Russia, or OPEC+, said they would stick with the previously announced output plan, resisting calls to step up the pace of production.

Following two days of meetings, OPEC+ said they would increase monthly overall production for the month of August to 648,000 barrels per day, unchanged from a prior agreement earlier this month.

Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA), APA (NASDAQ:APA), and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) were among the biggest decliners falling about 3%

Tech stocks cut some losses, but remained a big drag on the broader market even as Treasury yields slipped after fresh signs that economic growth is slowing.

The 10-year Treasury yield slipped below 3% after data showing consumer spending is less robust than many believe, stoked recession fears and offset a slower than expected rise in inflation.

Consumer spending rose by 0.2% in May, short of forecasts for a 0.4% rise, while April’s figure was revised down to 0.6% growth from 0.9% previously.

As the consumer makes up about 70% of the economy, if they “are not out spending there is little hope the U.S. can avoid a near-term downturn,” Stifel said in a note.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) were down more than 1%.

Sentiment on Meta was also soured somewhat following a Reuters report Thursday, citing an internal company memo, that the social media company is bracing for slower growth in the second half of the year.

Story continues

Chip stocks, which led the slide in tech a day earlier, were also on the back foot. Micron (NASDAQ:MU) reported mixed quarterly results as revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, while guidance was also softer than expected.

On the earnings front, RH (NYSE:RH) fell more than 10% after the furnisher company cut its full-year outlook, flagging weaker consumer demand that could continue into the second half of the year.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), meanwhile, reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, but the drugstore chain kept its guidance unchanged as a slowdown in demand for Covid-19 vaccines is expected to weigh on growth.

In other news, bitcoin slipped below $20,000, triggering a fresh bout of selling across crypto-related stocks, with Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA), and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) nursing heavy losses.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 cut some losses Thursday, but remained on course for its worst first-half performance in decades as worries about a recession mount in the wake of Federal Reserve rate hikes to combat surging inflation.

The S&P 500 fell 0.95% on pace for its biggest first-half loss since 1970. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.9%, or 287 points and the Nasdaq was down 1.3%.

(“Agrico”) maakten vandaag de voltrekking van hun eerder aangekondigde bedrijfscombinatie bekend. Het gecombineerde bedrijf zal de naam Kalera behouden en zal op woensdag 29 juni 2022 beginnen met de verhandeling van gewone aandelen (“Kalera aandelen”) en warrants (“Kalera Warrants”) op Nasdaq onder de nieuwe tickersymbolen “KAL” en “KALWW”, respectievelijk.

Deze mededeling omvat bepaalde verklaringen die geen historische feiten betreffen, maar wel toekomstgerichte verklaringen in het kader van de Safe Harbor-bepalingen van de toepasselijke effectenwetten. Toekomstgerichte verklaringen gaan doorgaans vergezeld van woorden zoals “geloven”, “kunnen”, “zullen”, “ramen”, “doorgaan”, “verwachten”, “de intentie hebben”, “voorspellen”, “zouden”, “moeten”, “plannen”, “potentieel”, “lijken”, “trachten”, “toekomst”, “vooruitzichten” en dergelijke verklaringen die toekomstige gebeurtenissen of trends voorspellen of aangeven of die geen weergave van historische zaken vormen.

Deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen omvatten, maar zijn niet beperkt tot, verklaringen betreffende de voorwaarden en bepalingen van de voorgestelde bedrijfscombinatie en de hierin besproken transacties, het tijdstip van de voltrekking van deze transacties, veronderstellingen betreffende terugkopen door Aandeelhouders en de daaruit verwachte voordelen en financiële positie van de partijen. Deze verklaringen zijn gebaseerd op diverse veronderstellingen en/of de huidige verwachtingen van het management van Agrico of Kalera. Deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen worden louter ter illustratie verstrekt en zijn niet bedoeld als, en mogen niet door beleggers of andere personen worden beschouwd als, een garantie, verzekering, voorspelling of definitieve verklaring van enig feit of enige waarschijnlijkheid. Werkelijke gebeurtenissen en omstandigheden zijn moeilijk of onmogelijk met zekerheid te voorspellen en zullen afwijken van de veronderstellingen. Veel werkelijke gebeurtenissen en omstandigheden vallen buiten de controle van Agrico en/of Kalera. Deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen zijn onderhevig aan diverse risico's en onzekerheden, met inbegrip van, zonder beperking, algemene economische, financiële, wettelijke, politieke en bedrijfsomstandigheden en wijzigingen op de binnenlandse en buitenlandse markten; het aantal terugkoopverzoeken van de publieke Aandeelhouders van Agrico; wijzigingen in de veronderstellingen die ten grondslag liggen aan de verwachtingen van Kalera betreffende zijn toekomstige zaken; de impact van de concurrentie op de toekomstige zaken van Kalera; en de uitslag van gerechtelijke procedures waar Kalera partij bij is of kan worden.

Als deze risico's bewaarheid worden of als de veronderstellingen onjuist blijken, kunnen de werkelijke resultaten aanzienlijk verschillen van de resultaten die in deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen begrepen zijn. Er kunnen aanvullende risico's zijn die Kalera en Agrico op dit moment niet kennen of als niet belangrijk beschouwen en die er ook toe kunnen leiden dat de werkelijke resultaten aanzienlijk verschillen van de resultaten die in deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen begrepen zijn. Daarnaast weerspiegelen toekomstgerichte verklaringen verwachtingen, veronderstellingen, plannen of voorspellingen van toekomstige gebeurtenissen en meningen per datum van deze mededeling. Kalera en Agrico verwachten dat latere gebeurtenissen en ontwikkelingen zullen leiden tot wijzigingen in deze beoordelingen. Hoewel Kalera en/of Agrico kunnen besluiten om deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen op enig moment in de toekomst bij te werken, wijst zowel Kalera als Agrico specifiek iedere verplichting daartoe van de hand, behoudens verplichting door toepasselijke wetten. Deze toekomstgerichte verklaringen mogen niet worden beschouwd als een weergave van de oordelen van Kalera of Agrico (of hun betrokken verbonden vennootschappen) op enig moment na de datum van deze schriftelijke mededeling. Er mag dan ook geen overmatig vertrouwen worden gesteld in de toekomstgerichte verklaringen.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:16:12+00:00,Petro Pick for Market-Friendly Minister Fails to Satisfy Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Economists and analysts welcomed Colombia President-elect Gustavo Petro’s pick of renowned economist Jose Antonio Ocampo as Colombia’s finance minister, but said more signs of political moderation might be needed to lure investors to the nation’s battered assets.

The Colombian peso weakened on Thursday as Petro’s choice of a market-friendly minister wasn’t enough to offset a negative mood toward emerging-market currencies.

Ocampo, 69, is one of Colombia’s best-known economists and has a doctorate from Yale. He served as finance minister in the 1990s, was head of the National Planning Department, and more recently a central bank board member. He has held several positions at the United Nations and is also a long-time professor at Columbia University in New York.

Here is what economists and analysts are saying:

Alejandro Arreaza, economist at Barclays

Ocampo’s pick as finance minister as well as Petro’s talks with centrist parties are “a signal of moderation,” he said “Petro seems to understand the political constraints that he faces and is showing willingness to negotiate the changes that he would like to implement, which should contribute to contain risks for the market” Ocampo is an experienced economist who understands the challenges the economy is facing while seeking to meet social demands with fiscal responsibility, according to Arreaza “That will not be an easy job considering the high expectations that Petro has generated in the electorate but in his favor he has a positive economic backdrop” Julio Romero, economist at Corficolombiana

“It’s key to understand what the priorities of the tax reform will be and Ocampo’s position regarding the commodity sector, since Petro’s proposals to phase out that industry generate a lot of concern” Carolina Monzon, economist Itau Corpbanca Colombia

Ocampo’s extensive experience would guarantee that the tax reform that Petro has spoken about will balance raising taxes and preserving economic growth Ocampo’s return to the board of the central bank, now as finance minister, will be key to determine how far the rate increasing cycle will go She estimates the benchmark rate will reach 9.5% at the end of the current cycle “While the news may be positive for markets, we would have to wait for more comments from him and the international scenario is very volatile,” she said In that sense, it’s difficult to see a strong rally in Colombian assets, according to her Daniel Rico, strategist at RBC Capital Markets

If Petro “wants to pass his structural fiscal reform he will need to focus on the top 1% and large wealth redistribution” This could trigger large capital outflows, leaving the balance of payments “at risk” “Therefore the government will have to play a larger role in controlling capital outflows” Benito Berber, economist at Natixis

“It’s a good sign. He’s an official with a lot of experience, and respected in and outside Colombia” “Petro is signaling that he’s committed to fiscally prudent policies” “The Colombian peso isn’t reacting because there are very strong headwinds,” but it will likely advance in the coming days Juana Tellez, economist at BBVA Colombia

“Ocampo is an economist with an excellent academic background and extensive work experience on different fronts” “That gives him all the tools to face the economic situation in Colombia and put the country on track to meet medium-term needs” Daniel Velandia, economist at Credicorp Capital

The external environment is very complicated and that limits the advance of assets in Colombia In relative terms, a very short-term positive impact could be seen compared to its peers, which may not last long Assets may perform well if Petro choses market-friendly names for relevant ministries and government institutions However, all these reactions will probably be temporary as the most important driver for markets will be his reform agenda to be presented to congress Investors will scrutinize his policy proposals for the oil industry and the tax and pension reforms, which will have a direct impact on capital markets.

(collectively with its affiliates, ""Saba"" or ""we""), a significant shareholder of the Templeton Global Income Fund (NYSE: GIM) (""GIM"" or the ""Fund""), today commented on the results of GIM’s inspector of elections’ review of the voting results of the Fund’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the ""Annual Meeting""). Following Franklin Templeton’s demand for a review, the inspector of elections has reaffirmed shareholders’ vote for Saba’s full slate of nominees – Karen Caldwell, Ketu Desai, Anatoly Nakum and Mark Hammitt – to the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the ""Board""). Shareholders first voted to elect all of Saba’s nominees at the Annual Meeting held on June 6, 2022, according to preliminary voting results.

Once the shareholder vote is certified following a ruling from the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York (the ""Court""), Saba-nominated trustees will constitute a majority of the 11-member Board, building on the prior election of four Saba nominees to the Board in 2021.

Boaz Weinstein, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Saba, said:

""This is a win for all GIM shareholders: the inspector of elections' review reaffirmed shareholders’ vote for all of Saba Capital’s nominees to the GIM Board. Franklin Templeton appears more focused on clinging to boardroom control and generating management fees than on shareholders’ interests. It has been nearly nine years since GIM traded at or above its NAV for even a single day, and yet Franklin Templeton is now using litigation to obstruct our trustees’ efforts to narrow the discount to NAV and create value for shareholders. We look forward to the Court’s expedited ruling so that these results can be certified and our nominees can be appointed to their rightful seats on the Board.""

Final results of the Annual Meeting will be published by the Fund once they are certified by the inspector of elections following the ruling by the Court on the Fund’s complaint.

Carlson will serve as non-executive Chairman.

“We are thrilled that Jim is stepping into the role of Chairman of InnovAge,” said Andrew Cavanna, outgoing Chairman of the Board. “Jim’s skill set, experience and reputation makes him an ideal fit to lead the InnovAge Board.”

“I have known Jim for 25 years and he is one of the best liked and most skilled CEOs in healthcare. His experience and wisdom will be an enormous help to Patrick and the Board as we work to position InnovAge for peak performance for our participants,” said Tom Scully, InnovAge Director.

“Jim’s decades of operating experience in coordinated, value-based care – especially for frail seniors in government-sponsored programs – make him a terrific and timely addition to our Board,” said Patrick Blair, President & Chief Executive Officer at InnovAge. “What’s more, Jim’s time at the helm leading a national, mission-driven healthcare company and his track-record of building trusting partnerships with a diverse group of stakeholders, will surely help accelerate our transformation and make him a particularly strong fit for InnovAge at this moment.”

“I’ve long believed that solving the health care, social and financing needs of our aging population, especially for the most frail, was one of the critical challenges for our society. The company’s thought leadership and successes are impressive and I’m delighted to join the InnovAge Board to work with Patrick Blair and his team to help achieve their important vision,” said Mr. Carlson.

With the addition of Mr. Carlson, InnovAge's Board will be expanded from nine to ten directors, five of whom are independent.

Mr. Carlson served as Chief Executive Officer of Amerigroup Corporation, a Fortune 500 multi-state managed healthcare company, from 2007 through 2012, becoming chairman of the company's board of directors in 2008. In December 2012, Amerigroup was acquired by WellPoint (now Anthem), the country's second largest health insurer, in a transaction valued at nearly $5 billion. Under Mr. Carlson's leadership, Amerigroup more than doubled the number of state Medicaid programs it served while growing revenues more than four-fold. Mr. Carlson was the founder of HealthSpring, a physician group practice management company, which was sold to MetraHealth in 1995 (subsequently to become part of United Healthcare). Mr. Carlson also served as an Executive Vice President at UnitedHealth Group before leaving to co-found Workscape (later acquired by ADP), a software platform. Mr. Carlson currently serves on the board of directors of PurFoods and is co-founder of Guidon Partners. He has previously served on the Boards of Omnicare, Acelity, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), Morningside University, the National Kidney Foundation and the Health Sector Advisory Council for the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. He was also a member of the Business Roundtable. Mr. Carlson attended Morningside University in Sioux City, Iowa, and graduated from Rider University in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

DENVER, June 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InnovAge (NASDAQ: INNV), today announced the appointment of experienced health care executive James (“Jim”) Carlson to its Board of Directors, effective June 30, 2022. Carlson will serve as non-executive Chairman.

“We are thrilled that Jim is stepping into the role of Chairman of InnovAge,” said Andrew Cavanna, outgoing Chairman of the Board. “Jim’s skill set, experience and reputation makes him an ideal fit to lead the InnovAge Board.”

“I have known Jim for 25 years and he is one of the best liked and most skilled CEOs in healthcare. His experience and wisdom will be an enormous help to Patrick and the Board as we work to position InnovAge for peak performance for our participants,” said Tom Scully, InnovAge Director.

“Jim’s decades of operating experience in coordinated, value-based care – especially for frail seniors in government-sponsored programs – make him a terrific and timely addition to our Board,” said Patrick Blair, President & Chief Executive Officer at InnovAge. “What’s more, Jim’s time at the helm leading a national, mission-driven healthcare company and his track-record of building trusting partnerships with a diverse group of stakeholders, will surely help accelerate our transformation and make him a particularly strong fit for InnovAge at this moment.”

“I’ve long believed that solving the health care, social and financing needs of our aging population, especially for the most frail, was one of the critical challenges for our society. The company’s thought leadership and successes are impressive and I’m delighted to join the InnovAge Board to work with Patrick Blair and his team to help achieve their important vision,” said Mr. Carlson.

In December 2012, Amerigroup was acquired by WellPoint (now Anthem), the country's second largest health insurer, in a transaction valued at nearly $5 billion.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:10:57+00:00,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks fall as U.S. data supports recession fears; yields down,"(Updates with early U.S. markets activity, changes dateline, previous LONDON)

* U.S. stocks down in early trading

* Treasury yields slip for third straight day

* Oil falls on uncertainty over future OPEC+ output

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Stocks on global indexes were sharply lower on Thursday and Treasury yields slid after U.S. data showed consumer spending rose less than expected in May while price pressures were still strong enough to leave the Federal Reserve on its aggressive policy-tightening path.

The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 was set to register its worst first six months since 1970, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was set for its worst first half of a year on record.

The Commerce Department report on Thursday showed U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in May, and suggested inflation had probably peaked, while higher prices forced cutbacks on some purchases.

Rising interest rates and tight financial conditions have been fueling worries of a recession.

""Inflation is not something that we don't have to worry about anymore. It is expected to be with us for quite some time,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York.

Central bank chiefs from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England met in Portugal this week and voiced their renewed commitment to control inflation no matter what pain it caused.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 247.64 points, or 0.8%, to 30,781.67, the S&P 500 lost 26.34 points, or 0.69%, to 3,792.49 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 103.29 points, or 0.92%, to 11,074.60.

Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 has lost roughly 20%, its worst first-half of a year since 1970.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.50% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.95%.

The Fed's hawkishness and an investor desire for liquidity in difficult times have helped support the U.S. dollar.

Story continues

The dollar index fell 0.238%, with the euro up 0.27% to $1.0467.

In Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 27/32 in price to yield 2.9944%, from 3.093% late on Wednesday.

Oil prices fell as OPEC+ confirmed it would increase output in August only as much as previously announced.

U.S. crude recently fell 2.79% to $106.72 per barrel and Brent was at $115.16, down 0.95% on the day.

Spot gold dropped 0.3% to $1,812.43 an ounce.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:09:22+00:00,Tesla's run of record deliveries may be reaching the end of the road,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Akash Sriram

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is expected to end its nearly two-year-long run of record quarterly deliveries as a prolonged COVID-related shutdown in Shanghai hit its production and supply chain, highlighting the risks of its reliance on China.

While Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been pursuing the acquisition of social media platform Twitter Inc, his crown jewel, Tesla, has grappled with production glitches in China and slow output growth at new factories in Texas and Berlin.

Analysts expect Tesla to report deliveries of 295,078 vehicles for the second quarter as early as Friday, according to Refinitiv data. Several analysts have slashed their estimates further to about 250,000 due to China's prolonged lockdown.

This would be down from its record deliveries of 310,048 the preceding quarter, marking Tesla's first quarter-on-quarter decline in deliveries since the first quarter of 2020.

The world's most valuable automaker has posted record deliveries every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, weathering pandemic and supply-chain disruptions better than most automakers.

China has been instrumental in Tesla's rapid increase of vehicle production and Musk has praised workers there for ""burning the 3 a.m. oil.""

But China's prolonged zero-COVID lockdown - Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called it Tesla's ""albatross"" this quarter - caused deeper disruptions to output than Musk predicted. Tesla's low-cost, lucrative Shanghai factory produced roughly half of the company's total cars delivered last year, and Ives estimated the shutdown wiped out about 70,000 units in the quarter.

Musk said in April that Tesla's overall vehicle production in the second quarter would be ""roughly on par"" with the first quarter, driven by a China rebound. But he recently said Tesla had a ""very tough quarter,"" citing production and supply-chain challenges in China.

Story continues

Musk also said Tesla's new factories in Texas and Berlin are ""gigantic money furnaces"" losing billions of dollars as they struggle to increase production quickly. He said the carmaker's supply-chain problems are not over and keeping the factories running remains a concern.

""The key question is the magnitude of the (China production) decline and whether the Fremont (California) factory was able to help support volumes,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said.

He expects volumes to rebound strongly in the second half of the year, as Tesla boosts production at the Shanghai factory with the easing of a COVID-19 lockdown.

Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, was cautious about the outlook, saying the third quarter will be difficult for Tesla and other tech firms, citing a risk of recession.

Tesla has been laying off hundreds of employees in the United States, after Musk early this month told executives that he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and needed to cut about 10% of staff at the electric car maker.

Nevertheless, Musk has said demand for Tesla vehicles remains strong.

Tesla shares have fallen 37% since early April, hurt by Musk's Twitter deal and the China lockdown. Tesla shares were down 0.3% at $683.26 on Thursday.

Musk, a prolific Twitter user who this week passed the 100 million follower mark, has not been tweeting for over a week.

Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in a report, ""investors are growing fatigued with Elon's rants"" on the Twitter saga, politics and other topics.

""Many we speak to are questioning if we have reached 'peak Elon.'""

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:07:12+00:00,"Lam Research: The Global Leader in Semiconductor Equipment, Part 2","The is the second part of my analysis on Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ:LRCX). If you missed the first part, you can find it here.

To recap, Lam Research is a global leader in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processing industry, specifically in wafer fabrication equipment. The company supplies equipment used in the process steps of etch, deposition and cleaning and provides equipment for a broad variety of manufacturing and testing capabilities. The companys core specialty markets include Dielectric and Metals, ALD/PECVD, Etch and Wet Clean.

Silicon reshoring

Before we continue with the analysis on Lam itself, its worth diving into some near-term tailwinds that will drive increased spending in the industry as a whole.

One trend thats been gaining traction recently is silicon reshoring. Between pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, governments around the world are now increasingly focused on deglobalizing and building semiconductor manufacturing capabilities within their borders. This reshoring to regain control of a critical competency should support wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending and potentially offset some of the decline as the current cycle rolls over.

The U.S. has a low double-digit market share in semiconductor manufacturing today, compared to more than a third in the 1990s. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) has a dominant 50-55% share in global foundries and is a near monopoly in leading-node manufacturing. More governmental subsidies and funding through legislation, such as the CHIPS for America Act or FABS Act, can support wafer fab equipment even in a downturn.

What Lam does differently

With impending market tailwinds, Lam Research is better positioned than most to take advantage. Lam's manufacturing operations mainly consist of assembling and testing components, sub-assemblies and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or at the location of their customers. The assembly and testing of their products are conducted predominantly in clean room environments on site, and the company has agreements with third parties to outsource much of their manufacturing, production warehousing and logistics functions.

Story continues

This outsourcing model allows for Lam to shift the burden of manufacturing and other non-core functions to their outsourcing partners. This protects them from cyclical scaling issues and the inherent volatility thats part and parcel of the semiconductor industry.

The outsourcing model isnt free of long-term risk. Outsourcing increases the relative bargaining power of their suppliers (outsourcing partners) and poses a potential future risk.

Competitive edge

In the present, Lam Research maintains a competitive edge in its services provided. This is best illustrated by the fact that Lam serves all the worlds leading semiconductor manufacturers, as they operate as sole providers of equipment in their niche.

The company derives a particular competitive advantage in its equipment for atomic layer deposition (ALD). Lams Sense.i ALD system allows for industry-leading efficiency and accuracy in atomic layer deposition, helping maintain Lams leadership position in the market.

This niche is not permanently secure, however. In the future, Lam expects its competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and introduce new products and processes with enhanced price and performance characteristics. The possibility of competing services rendering Lams offerings obsolete drives competition and poses a risk for the company. As such, Lams most important competitive advantage remains the continued and timely development of new products and ongoing enhancements to its existing product line.

In the last five years, Lams R&D spending has been between 10% and 12% of revenue. The companys large size and industry expertise allows for efficiency and greater expenditures in research and development, allowing the company to defend its leadership position and keep its products and services ahead of the competitive curve.

Increasing recurring revenue

The companys revenue segments include Systems and Customer Support Business Group.

Systems includes the sale of leading-node equipment in etch (conductor, dielectric, through-silicon via), deposition (metal, dielectric) and clean (wet clean, dry plasma clean) process steps of semiconductor fabrication. In 2021, Systems revenue grew 47% year-over-year and comprised roughly 67% of total revenue.

Customer Support Business Group is an annuity-like revenue stream rising from increased utilization of the installed base. CSBG includes spares, customer service, technology and productivity upgrades and a specialty product line for new and refurbished lagging-node equipment. In 2021, CSBG revenue grew 42% year-over-year and comprised the remaining 33% of total revenue. With CSBG service revenue being a recurring revenue stream, the companys financials have become increasingly resilient over time.

Valuation

With a market capitalization of $59 billion and a price-earnings ratio of 13.35, Lam is well positioned for growth at the forefront of a growing industry. It employs modest leverage, enjoys high returns on incremental invested capital and does not dilute its equity. Overall, my intrinsic valuation estimate is $650 to $700 for the stock, representing upside potential of 64% in relation to its current price of around $427 per share

In the context of a volatile market with seemingly no bottom, investors should stress their models for different scenarios given macro uncertainty and semiconductor supply chain issues. Lam traded at a price-earnings ratio as low as 8 January 2019. Given a fundamentally more resilient business model with increased focus on wafer fabrication equipment, along with higher recurring revenue, I believe a price-earnings ratio of 12.5 is a reasonable worst case for valuation, while my worst case earnings per share estimate is $31 for 2023.

At current levels, a $680 price target (price-earnings ratio of 15.5 combined with my 2023 EPS estimate of $31) could support an attractive asymmetric reward/risk set up with ~80% upside vs. ~20% downside.

Northampton, MA --News Direct-- FedEx Corporation

Located in Northeast Washington, D.C., the FedEx Express Eckington Place facility’s 915 kW rooftop community solar installation is one of the largest in the nation’s capital, with the capacity to generate electricity for the equivalent of 150 homes. FedEx, along with D.C.-based solar developer Sol Systems and local nonprofit SOME (So Others Might Eat) have announced a special charitable arrangement that spreads the benefits of this community solar project even further into the District.

Watch this video to learn more about the FedEx community solar project at the FedEx Express Eckington station.

FedEx is allocating a portion of the electricity bill credits generated by the solar installation to local nonprofit SOME (So Others Might Eat), which provides services to individuals experiencing poverty and homelessness in the District.

“Giving back to an organization like SOME through this installation elevates the spirit of community solar,” said Gina Adams, Corporate Vice President for Government and Regulatory Affairs at FedEx and a lifelong Washingtonian. “As a part of the Ward 5 community, we saw an opportunity for FedEx to create an innovative giveback program that benefits the environment and advances the well-being of our D.C. neighbors at the same time. We hope what we’ve done with SOME may inspire others to think of creative sustainability solutions in their communities.”

“Having served Ward 5 for more than 50 years, SOME is thrilled to be partnering with FedEx, our esteemed neighbor, for this cutting-edge partnership that will result in significant cost savings for SOME. This budget-alleviating initiative will enable SOME to redirect the savings in support of our direct services to those experiencing homelessness and poverty in our nation’s capital,” said Ralph Boyd, SOME’s CEO and President. “We hope their inspired approach will herald a new wave of corporate-nonprofit engagement in the D.C. region.”

Story continues

The donated bill credits, in conjunction with a supplemental cash donation from FedEx, are intended to offset the approximate annual electricity costs at two SOME facilities located in Ward 5: Isaiah House, a day program for those impacted by homelessness as well as mental illness, and Weinberg House, an affordable housing building for 28 families.

“What FedEx is doing here exemplifies the very nature of community solar projects, which is exactly what Mayor Bowser and the Department of Energy and Environment encourage through programs like Solar for All,” said Tommy Wells, Director of the District of Columbia’s Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE), “and we hope that more businesses will follow suit: this is an excellent way to support the community in which you do business.”

The installation of the solar project at this FedEx Express facility was completed in late 2021 by Sol Systems. Additionally, Sol Systems plans to match FedEx’s first-year contribution and volunteer with SOME over the lifetime of the project.

“Sol has been a proud and committed member of the community since we were founded in 2008,” said Yuri Horwitz, Chief Executive Officer of Sol Systems. “We are excited to deliver solar energy and drive tangible economic benefits to our local community with FedEx and SOME. We hope this initiative motivates others to follow FedEx’s leadership here.”

Community solar projects generate energy from solar panels that then feed into the District’s electricity grid to offset electricity usage for a number of customers, rather than just onsite consumption. In exchange for installing the solar panels on its roof, the FedEx Express facility receives bill credits toward its own electricity bill and can apply a portion of those credits to another electricity user in the District.

In March 2021, FedEx announced a goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2040 and has committed an initial investment of $2 billion in support of this goal in the key areas of fleet electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration. Increased use of renewable energy sources in the electricity grid will help FedEx and other consumers of energy reduce what are known as “Scope 2” greenhouse gas emissions generated from purchased energy.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:05:08+00:00,Net Zero Healthcare: Envisioning an All-Electric Future for Hospitals,"The importance of healthcare infrastructure cannot be understated.

Northampton, MA --News Direct-- WSP

By Alessandro Ciampechini

Worldwide, citizens depend on hospitals, which must run 24/7 without interruption to deliver continual critical care. From cooling and ventilation to sterilisation and lighting, the energy needs of hospitals are significant and, as such, their carbon emissions are high: indeed, the healthcare sector is responsible for 4.4 per cent of annual global emissions1. But more and more countries are pledging to meet net zero targets and hospitals have a significant responsibility here. Decarbonisation of the healthcare sector is a pressing and difficult challenge on a global scale. Is electrification part of the solution? By incorporating electrification, hospitals can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and reap significant benefits. An all-electric facility represents the opportunity to save on energy costs, contribute to improving human health and pave the way towards a greener, more sustainable future for healthcare and the planet.

Exploring electrification

The electrification of hospitals involves swapping existing technologies and systems that use fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles. If sources of zero-carbon electricity such as wind, solar, hydro and geothermal can be harnessed by hospitals to meet their substantial energy needs this would significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Alessandro Ciampechini, Associate Director, WSP, provides an insight into what the transition to sustainable, electrified energy entails: ‘It’s about converting HVAC systems to electric technologies,’ he explains. ‘This will require a redesign of most of the heating and hot water generation systems, allowing for lower temperature set points. In addition, although future hospitals will need to reduce the amount of steam used, electricity can contribute to steam generation, including sterilisation usage.’

Story continues

Ciampechini is working on the Energy Strategy for Net Zero by 2030 at Royal United Hospital in Bath, which is an example of a hospital that is aiming to electrify its operations to cut carbon emissions. ‘We have developed the work around three main areas: reducing energy demand by optimising existing equipment and through systems upgrades; maximising renewable generation on site through solar PV; and eliminating fossil fuels by electrifying energy use on the site,’ he says. In Australia, plans for the country’s first all-electric hospital are underway. Adelaide’s new Women’s and Children’s Hospital (nWCH) will be connected to an electricity source powered by South Australia's increasingly renewable grid – in 2020, renewables delivered 60 per cent of the state’s energy needs – and will also use electricity generated and stored on site.

Is the future all-electric?

Visions of a future where hospitals are all-, or at least part-, electric are encouraging, but is it truly an attainable goal? Lives depend on hospitals running consistently and continuously and it is essential that they have a reliable and sufficient energy supply so this is an important consideration when weighing up introducing electrification. Ciampechini acknowledges that there are indeed challenges but says these hurdles can be overcome providing hospitals make adequate and thorough preparations: ‘Hospitals and care settings have unique heat requirements, including high temperature steam and substantial hot water demand, which in some cases can be difficult to meet using low carbon technologies such as heat pumps, heat networks and solar thermal,’ he states. ‘As a consequence, each estate needs a comprehensive technical assessment and detailed strategy and business case to find the most effective solution.’

With growing numbers of suppliers of renewable energy that can provide hospitals with renewable electricity sources irrespective of where they are located, as well as burgeoning innovations and technologies, electrification is a real possibility. ‘From a technology perspective we already have all we need to make it happen,’ says Ciampechini. ‘Moreover, in the coming years these technologies will improve their efficiency and deliverability to a wider range of applications.’ Establishing electrification is likely to require a higher initial investment but will prove financially beneficial in the long term through energy savings and avoiding future levies on fossil fuels use. ‘The implementation plan needs to be realistic and cannot disrupt typical hospital operations,’ says Ciampechini. ‘Major investments can be bundled with hospital refurbishment or within equipment’s life cycle replacement programmes. Replacing carbon intensive equipment at the end of its useful technical life with low or zero carbon equipment also makes financial sense from an operating expense perspective in the medium to long term.’

A transformative option

Ultimately, if hospitals across the globe can become fully electric or incorporate greater use of electrified energy into their buildings and operations, it could create a virtuous circle. As the electricity grids continue to decarbonise , greater use of electricity in healthcare will valuably contribute to achieving crucial operational net zero outcomes with, for example, the greenhouse emission savings of Adelaide’s nWCH estimated to be 2,178 tonnes per year, which is the equivalent of removing around 700 vehicles from the road. There will be benefits for public health due to the myriad of health problems associated with natural gas emissions as well as further commonalities around greater back up generation capacity and enhanced plant operational flexibility. The use of zero emissions vehicles, for example, means less pollution and related illnesses, saving on healthcare costs. Furthermore, hospitals have the potential to enhance their resilience by incorporating electric innovations and thereby improving their power availability and reliability. Government support and investment is required to afford hospitals the building blocks they need to go electric and with new and exciting innovations emerging, the options for electrification will continue to expand. Not only is the electrification of hospitals feasible, but it has the potential to breathe new life into ageing infrastructure and enable hospitals to be future-ready.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:20+00:00,Drugmaker Endo misses $38 million interest payment amid bankruptcy talks,"By Dietrich Knauth

June 30 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Endo International said on Thursday it has missed a $38 million interest payment, amid discussions with a group of unsecured bondholders that have urged the company to avoid filing for bankruptcy.

Endo, which has been weighed down by litigation over the opioid epidemic in the United States, has discussed the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection in several recent public filings.

Other pharmaceutical companies that have filed for Chapter 11 to address opioid claims include Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and Mallinckrodt PLC, a generic opioid manufacturer that recently emerged from bankruptcy.

Dublin, Ireland-based Endo said in a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the missed loan payment will not immediately impact daily operations because the company has $1.4 billion in liquidity. The missed payment triggers a 30 day window before an official default on its loan.

Endo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A group of unsecured bondholders has recently formed to lobby the company to stay out of bankruptcy. The group said on Monday it has proposed alternate restructuring options, including a cash tender offer or a debt-for-debt exchange, that would reduce Endo's interest expenses without the disruption of a Chapter 11 filing.

Endo has reported $660 million of total funded debt maturities through the end of March 2027.

State and local governments have filed more than 3,000 lawsuits against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies alleging they helped fuel the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic. Opioids were involved in more than 80,000 overdose deaths in 2021, according to statistics produced by the White House office of drug control policy.

Endo has settled opioid lawsuits brought by several states in recent months, agreeing to pay $65 million to Florida, $26 million to West Virginia, and $25 million to Alabama.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:04+00:00,Lam Research (LRCX) Proceeds Well Toward Zero-Carbon Goals,"Lam Research Corporation LRCX seems to be progressing well on its environmental sustainability path, which is evident from its recent accomplishments.

The company, which is committed to reaching its goal of carbon net-zero emissions by 2050 and operating business on 100% renewable energy by 2030, has introduced a foundational strategy to boost sustainability throughout the supply chain.

LRCX has come up with various energy-efficient etch products, which are capable of reducing tool usage of helium by up to 80%. The products are designed to boost generator efficiency by up to 15% in NAND and foundry logic development.

In addition, the company significantly decreased its Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, saved 6.3 million gallons of water in water-stressed regions and diverted 99% of hazardous waste from landfills in 2021.

Lam Research’s increasing use of renewable energy remains a major positive. Last year, the company’s use of renewable energy accounted for 54% of the total energy consumption.

With such achievements and strong carbon neutrality efforts, Lam Research remains well-poised to gain solid momentum, wherein the demand for lowering the hazardous environmental impacts of business operations is increasing fast.

Switching to the use of clean and renewable energy is expected to help the company gain investor optimism in the days ahead. Notably, Lam Research has lost 40.6% on a year-to-date basis.

Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus

Renewable Energy in Demand

With the latest move, Lam Research peps up the carbon neutrality game for other tech companies like Amazon AMZN, KLA Corporation KLAC and Analog Devices ADI, which are also taking initiatives to adopt alternative energy sources to lower overall carbon emissions and cut energy bills substantially.

Amazon aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Further, AMZN revealed that it could reach 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of schedule.

The e-commerce giant is currently the biggest corporate investor in renewable energy. Amazon’s total count of renewable energy projects stands at more than 274 across the globe at present.

Analog Devices pledged to reach carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions by 2030 and 2050, respectively.

ADI intends to shift its overall operations to 100% renewable energy by 2025. It is also gearing up to address emissions across the full value chain by 2030.

Meanwhile, KLA is committed to powering its global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030. Precisely, KLA is targeting a 46% cumulative reduction in both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 from its 2019 baseline.

Story continues

Bottom Line

The latest move of Lam Research is in sync with its strong efforts to bolster its presence in the semiconductor industry by deepening its focus on maximizing the sustainability impacts of its technologies and solutions.

We believe that the company’s strengthening endeavors will continue to shape its trajectory in the intensifying carbon neutrality game. Its robust environmental measures across its operations remain noteworthy.

However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is currently suffering from uncertainties associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Supply-chain disruptions and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remain major concerns.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:04+00:00,Here's Why Seattle Genetics (SGEN) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.

Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.

Below, we take a look at Seattle Genetics (SGEN), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.

It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Seattle Genetics currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.

You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>

Set to Beat the Market?

Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SGEN that show why this biotechnology company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.

Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.

Story continues

For SGEN, shares are up 8.39% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is up 7.08% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 33.47% compares favorably with the industry's 1.21% performance as well.

While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Seattle Genetics have increased 17.88% over the past quarter, and have gained 13.41% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -17.26% and -9.6%, respectively.

Investors should also pay attention to SGEN's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SGEN is currently averaging 1,789,297 shares for the last 20 days.

Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SGEN.

Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SGEN's consensus estimate, increasing from -$3.52 to -$3.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SGEN is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Seattle Genetics on your short list.

Growth Opportunities

With the latest move, Vishay remains well-positioned to capitalize on the growing proliferation of applications related to passive electronic-component devices and the increasing demand for sophisticated electronic-component designs.

Its strong thermistor offerings will likely benefit from the growing adoption of building and home automation systems, the increasing use of temperature sensors in the automotive industry, and the rising applications of portable and advanced healthcare equipment across the world.

Per a report by Data Bridge Market Research, the global thermistor market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.4% between 2022 and 2029 and hit $114.9 billion by 2029.

Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide thermistor temperature sensor market is anticipated to see a CAGR of 7.5% between 2021 and 2026.

Expansion of Suite of Products

The latest launch bodes well for Vishay’s strong efforts toward enriching its product menu.

Apart from the latest move, Vishay recently unveiled a series of surface-mount TRANSZORB bidirectional transient voltage suppressors for automotive, industrial and telecom applications.

VSH released a high-precision thin-film wraparound chip resistor named the Vishay Sfernice PEP. The chip resistor offers higher power ratings in smaller case sizes for miniaturization and minimizes the mechanical stress on solder joints.

Vishay introduced an AEC-Q200-qualified charging resistor, featuring wire-wound technology in standard package size.

VSH also unveiled the latest device in its fourth-generation 600 V E Series power MOSFETs, providing high efficiency for telecom, server and data center power-supply applications.

We believe that these endeavors will continue to shape its growth trajectory and sustain momentum in various end markets that it serves.

Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector can consider better-ranked stocks like Paycom Software PAYC, Aspen Technology AZPN and Amdocs DOX.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:04+00:00,Aaon (AAON) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why,"Aaon (AAON) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Aaon is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.

For Aaon, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.

Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions

As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding.

Earnings Estimate Revisions for Aaon

For the fiscal year ending December 2022, this maker of air conditioning and heating equipment is expected to earn $1.79 per share, which is a change of 54.3% from the year-ago reported number.

Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aaon. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6.5%.

Bottom Line

Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:04+00:00,TransAlta (TAC) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,"Investors might want to bet on TransAlta (TAC), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.

Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for TransAlta basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.

For TransAlta, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.

If you suffered a loss on your Unilever investments or would like to inquire about potentially pursuing claims to recover your loss under the federal securities laws, you can submit your contact information at www.glancylaw.com/cases/unilever-plc/. You can also contact Charles H. Linehan, of GPM at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, or via email at shareholders@glancylaw.com to learn more about your rights.

On July 19, 2021, Unilever’s subsidiary ice cream company, Ben & Jerry’s announced that, upon the expiration of the current licensing agreement by which its products had been distributed in Israel for decades, it would end sales of its ice cream in “Occupied Palestinian Territory” but would purportedly continue to sell its products in Israel. On this news, the Company’s ADR price fell $0.58 per ADR, or 1%.

Then, on July 22, 2021, CNBC reported that Texas and Florida were examining Ben & Jerry’s actions in connection with their legislation against the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (“BDS”) movement, a controversial movement whose objective is to coerce Israel into making concessions to the Palestinians. In a letter from the state of Florida’s CFO Jimmy Patronis, who controls Florida’s public pension funds, Florida would “be prohibited from investing in Ben & Jerry’s or its parent company, Unilever.” That also meant that Unilever could not enter or renew contracts with the state or any municipality in Florida.

On this news, Unilever’s ADR price fell $3.08, or 5.4%, to close at $53.45 per ADR on July 22, 2021, thereby injuring investors further.

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that, in July 2020, Ben & Jerry’s board passed a resolution to end sales of its ice cream in “Occupied Palestinian Territory”; (2) the risks attendant to the Ben & Jerry’s board’s decision; (3) the foregoing risked adverse governmental actions for violations of laws, executive orders, or resolutions aimed at discouraging boycotts, divestment, and sanctions of Israel adopted by 35 U.S. states; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Unilever ADRs during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than August 15, 2022 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit. To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action. If you wish to learn more about this class action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to the pending class action lawsuit, please contact Charles Linehan, Esquire, of GPM, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com, or visit our website at www.glancylaw.com.

On April 27, 2022, Teladoc released its first quarter 2022 financial results, reporting revenue of $565.4 million – $3.23 million less than consensus estimates – and “[n]et loss per share of $41.58, primarily driven by [a] non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.6 billion or $41.11 per share.” Additionally, the Company revised its Full Year 2022 revenue guidance “to reflect dynamics we are currently experiencing in the [D2C] mental health and chronic condition markets.” The Company attributed its poor performance to increased competition in its chronic care businesses.

On this news, Teladoc’s stock fell $22.48, or 40.2%, to close at $33.51 on April 28, 2022, thereby injuring investors.

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) increased competition, among other factors, was negatively impacting Teladoc’s BetterHelp and chronic care businesses; (2) accordingly, the growth of those businesses was less sustainable than Defendants had led investors to believe; (3) as a result, Teladoc’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA projections for FY 2022 were unrealistic; (4) as a result of all the foregoing, Teladoc would be forced to recognize a significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP (“GPM”) reminds investors of the upcoming July 5, 2022 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Mullen Automotive, Inc. f/k/a Net Element, Inc. (“Mullen” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MULN) securities between June 15, 2020 and April 6, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

If you suffered a loss on your Mullen investments or would like to inquire about potentially pursuing claims to recover your loss under the federal securities laws, you can submit your contact information at www.glancylaw.com/cases/mullen-automotive-inc/. You can also contact Charles H. Linehan, of GPM at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, or via email at shareholders@glancylaw.com to learn more about your rights.

On April 6, 2022, Hindenburg Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Mullen misrepresented results of certain battery testing. Furthermore, the report claimed that a 2020 joint venture to manufacture Mullen’s battery technology “didn’t exist at all” and was “an apparent fabrication.”

On this news, Mullen’s stock fell $0.34, or 12.5%, over two consecutive trading sessions to close at $2.38 per share on April 7, 2022, thereby injuring investors.

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Mullen overstated its ability and timeline regarding production; (2) Mullen overstated its deals with business partners, including Qiantu Motors; (3) Mullen overstated its battery technology and capabilities; (4) Mullen overstated its ability to sell its branded products; (5) Net Element did not conduct proper due diligence into Mullen Technologies; (6) the Dragonfly K50 was not (solely) delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Mullen securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 5, 2022 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit. To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action. If you wish to learn more about this class action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to the pending class action lawsuit, please contact Charles Linehan, Esquire, of GPM, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com, or visit our website at www.glancylaw.com.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:00+00:00,"VGP Announces the Signature of its First Acquisition Project in France, with VALGO","PRESS RELEASE

Regulated Information

June 30, 2022, 18:00 CET, Petit-Couronne, France: VGP NV (“VGP” or “the Group”) and VALGO signed an agreement to purchase 32 hectares of land that housed the former Petroplus refining units in Petit-Couronne, near Rouen. This brownfield rehabilitation project is fully in line with VGP's core expertise and strategy. Thanks to the six years ownership of the site by VALGO and its expertise in asbestos removal, soil and water table decontamination, in-situ waste treatment and development, this area has now become a suitable site for the development of new industries and business activities.

On the banks of the river Seine and close to the A13 highway, the 32-hectare area of land offers its future users a highly strategic location. Following the extensive depollution work carried out by VALGO, the site is now ready for redevelopment. VGP expanded into France only a few months ago and is delighted to start its French business activities in the dynamic Rouen Normandy metropolis area, via this major project. In total, around 150,000 m² of land are set to be redeveloped to accommodate industrial and logistics projects, with work due to begin in 2023.

Collaboration with local authorities is an absolute priority for the Group, since development projects directly impact their surroundings. In Petit-Couronne, the revitalization of this brownfield site will therefore be an opportunity to help stimulate the area in terms of employment and so meet the economic and environmental challenges of the Rouen region. Aurélien Coudert, General Manager of VGP France, is delighted that the Group’s first steps in France are being taken in partnership with VALGO and is convinced by the attractiveness of the region and its development potential.

VGP and VALGO are also joining forces to implement an ambitious and innovative environmental policy. Through a policy of innovation serving clients and geographies, VGP puts the challenges of energy efficiency, carbon footprint reduction and sustainable buildings at the heart of its projects. The company is committed to being carbon neutral by 2025 and is also aiming for BREEAM Excellent building certification, as well as green energy production on its projects. In addition, the VGP Foundation, created in 2019, already supports 29 projects that address issues around access to education, biodiversity preservation and the protection of cultural heritage.

Jan Van Geet, CEO VGP:
“VGP is delighted to begin its business activities in France on a site as exceptional as this one, with strong economic and environmental ambitions that are shared by both our partner, VALGO, and the local authorities. As the rehabilitation of brownfield sites is at the heart of our business, this project is a great opportunity for us to deploy our industrial and logistical know-how. The uncertain geopolitical situation and the rise in transport prices mean that companies are increasingly looking for local support to start their business. In this context, we strongly believe in the relevance of our integrated model with a long-term vision. We are now eager to get to work and bring all the expertise of the Group to the project.""

François Bouché, CEO VALGO:
""We are delighted that this huge piece of land has been sold to a major investor with experience in redeveloping brownfields in Europe. However, I would first like to celebrate the work of the men and women who worked so hard to make this colossal project a success. It took more than 1 million hours and over €60 million in investment by VALGO to turn the page on over 80 years of refining on this site, which already employs 600 people.”

VGP is advised on this project by the legal practices Cheuvreux (Eric Hervy), Ireo (Marine Javelle) and EOL (Jean-François Mounic).

Gereglementeerde informatie

30 juni 2022, 18:00 CET, Petit-Couronne, Frankrijk: VGP NV (“VGP” of “de Groep”) en VALGO hebben een verkoopbelofte ondertekend voor de aankoop van 32 hectare grond in Petit-Couronne, bij Rouen, waarop de voormalige Petroplus raffinaderijeenheden waren gevestigd. Dit brownfield herontwikkelingsproject is in lijn met VGP's expertise en strategie. Dankzij het feit dat VALGO al zes jaar eigenaar is van het terrein en haar expertise op het gebied van asbestverwijdering, bodem- en grondwatersanering, in-situ materiaal- en afvalverwerking en ontwikkeling, is in dit gebied een terrein ontstaan dat geschikt is voor de ontwikkeling van nieuwe industrieën en activiteiten.

Het terrein van 32 hectare, gelegen aan de oevers van de Seine en dicht bij de A13, is bijzonder strategisch gelegen voor toekomstige gebruikers. Na grondige sanering door VALGO is het terrein nu klaar voor herontwikkeling. VGP is nog maar enkele maanden in Frankrijk aanwezig en is verheugd om via dit grootschalige project haar activiteiten te starten op het dynamische grondgebied van de Normandische metropool Rouen. In totaal zal ongeveer 150.000 m² worden herontwikkeld voor industriële en logistieke projecten, waarbij het de bedoeling is dat de werkzaamheden in 2023 van start gaan.

Voor VGP is de samenwerking met de lokale overheden een absolute prioriteit, aangezien de ontwikkelingsprojecten een directe impact hebben op de betrokken gebieden. In Petit-Couronne zal de herontwikkeling van deze brownfield dan ook een gelegenheid zijn om deel te nemen aan de heropleving van het gebied in termen van werkgelegenheid en zo een antwoord te bieden op de economische en milieu-uitdagingen van de regio Rouen. Aurélien Coudert, Algemeen Directeur VGP Frankrijk, is verheugd over de samenwerking met VALGO en overtuigd van de aantrekkelijkheid van het gebied en het ontwikkelingspotentieel ervan.

VGP en VALGO bundelen ook hun krachten om een ambitieus en innoverend milieubeleid te voeren. Door een beleid van innovatie ten dienste van de klanten en de gebieden, plaatst VGP de uitdagingen van energie-efficiëntie, vermindering van de koolstofvoetafdruk en duurzaamheid van gebouwen in het centraal in haar projecten. Het bedrijf streeft ernaar om tegen 2025 koolstofneutraal te zijn en streeft ook naar een BREEAM Excellent-certificering van gebouwen en naar groene energieproductie op haar projecten. Daarnaast steunt de VGP Foundation, die in 2019 is opgericht, nu al 29 projecten op het gebied van toegang tot onderwijs, behoud van biodiversiteit en bescherming van cultureel erfgoed.

Jan Van Geet, CEO van VGP: ""VGP is verheugd om haar activiteit in Frankrijk te starten op een uitzonderlijke site, met sterke economische en milieu-ambities, gedeeld door zowel onze partner VALGO als de lokale autoriteiten. Aangezien de herontwikkeling van oude bedrijfsterreinen tot de kern van onze activiteiten behoort, is dit project voor ons een prachtige gelegenheid om onze industriële en logistieke knowhow in te zetten. Door de onzekere geopolitieke situatie en de stijging van de transportprijzen zoeken bedrijven steeds meer naar lokale steun om hun bedrijf op te starten. In deze context geloven wij sterk in de relevantie van ons geïntegreerd model met een langetermijnvisie. We kijken er nu naar uit om aan de slag te gaan en alle expertise van de Groep in het project in te brengen.”

François Bouché, CEO van VALGO: ""Wij zijn verheugd over de verkoop van dit omvangrijk perceel aan een grote investeerder die bekend is met de revitalisering van oude bedrijfsterreinen in Europa. Ik wil echter eerst het werk huldigen van de mannen en vrouwen die hebben geïnvesteerd in het succesvol slagen van iconische project. Meer dan 1 miljoen uren en meer dan 60 miljoen euro investeringen door VALGO waren nodig om de bladzijde om te slaan van meer dan 80 jaar raffinage op deze site, die nu al 600 banen biedt.”

VGP werd bij dit project bijgestaan door de Cheuvreux-studie (Eric Hervy), Ireo (Marine Javelle) en EOL (Jean-François Mounic).

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:00+00:00,"Growing Demand for Eco-Friendly Products to Support Global Microbial Biosurfactants Market, States Fact.MR","United States, Rockville, MD, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As per detailed analysis by Fact.MR, a market research and competitive intelligence provider, the global sales of microbial biosurfactantsmarket is estimated to exceed a valuation of US$ 16.5 million by 2022, and further expand at a CAGR of 3.9% by value over the assessment period of 2022-2032.

Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension between gas and liquid or two liquids. Surfactants are used in corrosion inhibition to promote oil flow in porous rocks and produce aerosols. Rhamnolipids are widely used in pharmaceuticals and therapeutics due to their prominent surface-active properties, low toxicity, and antimicrobial activities against several microbes.

Microbial synthesized surfactants are called biosurfactants. Different classes of biosurfactants have a significant position in both, microbiology and biotechnology. Currently, agriculture observes a most vital contest of stagnant crop yield. The need to surge the agricultural production for satisfying the food demand of the continuously increasing population has led to the customization of several agrochemicals.

Introduction of agrochemicals has surged agricultural production, but continuous use of these has suggestively weakened the health of the agroecosystem due to their long persistence in the environment. Microbial biosurfactants are extensively used in numerous industries because of their advanced features such as high biodegradability, renewability, and functionally care taken under extreme conditions, and they are more advantageous than chemical-based biosurfactants.

Rise in the use of biodegradable, non-toxic, and eco-friendly products is propelling the growth of the product market. Moreover, wide use of microbial biosurfactants in personal care - for instance - removal of skin and hair dirt - is escalating product demand in the global market. Additionally, increased use of microbial biosurfactants in applications such as oilfield chemicals, household detergents, etc., is likely to drive market growth over the coming years.

Paris La Défense, June 30, 2022 – Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, today announces the completion of the acquisition of Eurobank Merchant Acquiring activities, as part of its European consolidation strategy.

Eurobank Merchant Acquiring (EBMA) is a meaningful card acquirer in the very dynamic Greek market with 21% share of transaction volumes processed in the country.

In parallel, the exposure to the Greek economy fueled by the travel & hospitality industry offers added growth opportunities.

In this rapidly changing industry, driven by the customers’ adoption of numerous and innovative payment methods, Eurobank Merchant Acquiring is the ideal cornerstone to further deploy Worldline payment offerings and value-added services capabilities in the Greek market, combined with the large acceptance network of Cardlink (acquired in 2021) to offer end-to-end payment services.

As part of the transaction, Worldline enters a long-term commercial partnership with Eurobank aiming to leverage its strong banking network as a key commercial channel in order to distribute Worldline’s and EBMA best-in-class payment product and services to physical and online merchants.

Celonis’ process mining technology creates a real-time, continuously updated “X-ray” of how an organization runs at the process level. This “X-ray” reveals the hidden inefficiencies that silently kill organizational performance. Celonis combines this with their Execution Management System (EMS), which acts as the surgeon to the process mining “X-ray” to suggest and implement fixes for the issues found. These discoveries allow agencies to perform at levels never thought possible while also increasing their sustainability.

Celonis’ platform is usable across a wide variety of use cases within Government agencies and departments, from finance, procurement, and administrations’ transformation, to mission-focused employee and citizen service transformations. System transformation, process excellence, shared service, and financial agility initiatives are all core themes across use cases and where the power of Celonis’ process mining and execution management capabilities quickly deliver the most value.

“We are thrilled to partner with Carahsoft and their reseller partners to accelerate the time to value for government departments and agencies across the Public Sector,'' said Mike Daniels, Senior Vice President of Public Sector at Celonis. “The focus on digital transformation will only continue to increase given everything we’ve learned pre and post pandemic. This partnership ensures we can support every Government customer on their transformation journey as they support businesses and citizens around the world in response to inflation, supply chain and sustainability issues. We are proud to partner with Carahsoft in our joint pursuit of reducing the cost, the risk and dramatically increasing the success, sustainability and scale rate of all transformations.”

“The addition of Celonis’ process mining and Execution Management System to our offerings likely represents one of the largest opportunities for government services transformation since the cloud was introduced in 2010,” said Craig P. Abod, Carahsoft President. “Celonis technologies quickly find and fix process inefficiencies hidden in large, complex public systems to deliver improved services and operations as well as to maximize existing investments.”

Temecula, CA, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- Hop-on, Inc. (OTC: HPNN), and Digitalage recently attended VidCon US 2022 from June 22 to June 25, 2022. The first major gathering since the start of the pandemic of an eclectic bunch of internet followers presented an opportunity for all mega fans to meet and interact with their favorite creators. Our goal for the convention was to introduce #Digitalage and our #influencethefuture marketing campaign. The creators’ response was overwhelming and validates our thesis of the problem in today's Web 2.0 creator economy.

""We attended this event to promote our vision and belief that the content creator should be the owner of their content and thus be able to control who sees it, where it is seen, and how they can monetize it,"" said Peter Michaels, CEO. ""In today's economy, the goliath platforms are the ones that are reaping the rewards of content posted online. But, unfortunately, creators are not being properly compensated for their hard work. Instead, billions of dollars are improperly and unethically kept by the platforms as they continue to raise thresholds for payouts and increase their own bottom line.""

A popular influencer stated to us during an interview, ""Content creation is 95% work and 5% pay.""

Our attendance amongst over 70,000 attendees and experience at VidCon was genuinely mindblowing, and we are more enthusiastic about the future as we drive towards executing our vision to democratize content creation in a Web3 economy.

Curt Doty, Chief Creative Officer, states, ""In giving creators the flexibility to create anywhere on any device, Digitalage recognizes that the creator economy includes more than TikTokers and that by creating cross-device workplaces, we will attract different types of creators and broaden the definition of what an influencer is. Demonstrating these tools at VidCon excited all the creators I talked to.""

Some of the key wins and successes we achieved at the convention include:

Developed relationships with major influencers and creators for the Digitalage influencer programDigitalage team filmed interviews with multiple influencers, educated them on the platform, received feedback, and discussed the potential for future partnerships. Tiktok stars ""Twinsfromrussia"", music group ""On The Outside"", and Tiktok travel vlogger Michelle Gonzalez are just a few of the influencers that the team was able to interview and connect with.Collected invaluable insight and feedback on audience wants and needs within social mediaHad an opportunity to get an in-depth look into what other brands have planned for the future, providing competitive leverage as development continuesConnected with major stakeholders and cultivated important relationshipsShowcased Digitalage demos, videos, and imagery which offered attendees an inside look at the platformPromoted Digitalage's upcoming beta launch and generated interest in beta participationCaptivated attendees with successful activations that offered branded content creation opportunities and encouraged sharing in a frictionless manner

The American Whiskey Collective will be led by Pernod Ricard veteran marketing leader Craig Johnson, who is appointed to Pernod Ricard USA's executive team, and Jessica Chen, a seasoned Operations executive who is named VP, Operations, American whiskies. Johnson will report to Mukherjee, and Chen will report to Pierre Joncourt, SVP, Operations, Pernod Ricard North America.

The new dedicated unit will be responsible for achieving the business objectives – and leading future strategy development – for Pernod Ricard's American whiskey brands, while also leveraging the company's broad network to drive global growth. In recent years, Pernod Ricard created two similar entities -- the Gin Hub and House of Tequila – to drive even greater success in their respective spirits categories.

American whiskey volume in the U.S. has been accelerating over the last decade, shooting up from 16 million 9-liter cases in 2011 to 29.7 million in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.  Exports of American whiskey also have been enjoying strong growth, with annual sales now exceeding 20 million cases.

Story continues

American whiskey sales are expected to account for a significant amount of Pernod Ricard USA's total volumes within the next 5-10 years, and the company's American whiskey export business also has enormous growth potential, Mukherjee said. To help achieve Pernod Ricard USA's ambitious performance goals, the American Whiskey Collective will create more uniform ways of working based on best practice sharing among brands. Said Mukherjee: ""We are committed to ensuring that the infrastructure, marketing investment levels and innovation support behind each of our brands are in line with our overall ambition. The result will be further accelerated growth from a 'new fashioned' whiskey portfolio focused on pushing boundaries rather than adhering strictly to tradition.""

Worldline completes the acquisition of
Eurobank Merchant Acquiring activities

Paris La Défense, June 30, 2022 – Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, today announces the completion of the acquisition of Eurobank Merchant Acquiring activities, as part of its European consolidation strategy.

Eurobank Merchant Acquiring (EBMA) is a meaningful card acquirer in the very dynamic Greek market with 21% share of transaction volumes processed in the country. EBMA manages c. 219 million transactions acquired per year representing a payment volume of c. € 7 billion from a c. 190,000 POS network. The company serves a well-diversified and high-quality portfolio of 123,000 merchants of which more than 50% are SMBs in MSV terms.

This acquisition represents an opportunity for Worldline to strongly expand its Merchant Services activities in this dynamic Southern European market, still driven by the shift from cash to card with a significant electronic payments adoption rate and online and e-commerce development. In parallel, the exposure to the Greek economy fueled by the travel & hospitality industry offers added growth opportunities.

In this rapidly changing industry, driven by the customers’ adoption of numerous and innovative payment methods, Eurobank Merchant Acquiring is the ideal cornerstone to further deploy Worldline payment offerings and value-added services capabilities in the Greek market, combined with the large acceptance network of Cardlink (acquired in 2021) to offer end-to-end payment services.

As part of the transaction, Worldline enters a long-term commercial partnership with Eurobank aiming to leverage its strong banking network as a key commercial channel in order to distribute Worldline’s and EBMA best-in-class payment product and services to physical and online merchants.

As the European leader in payments, Worldline keeps executing its strategic roadmap with a focus on value-creative consolidation opportunities to enhance its scale, reach and direct presence in a growing number of countries in close partnership with leading local financial institutions.

LOWELL, Ark., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (NASDAQ: JBHT), one of the largest supply chain solutions providers in North America, announced today that the cargo vessel Johnelle has docked at the Port of Everett in Washington, with more than 250 new containers reserved for the expansion of J.B. Hunt’s intermodal fleet.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220630005652/en/

Cargo vessel Johnelle, among others, will transport new J.B. Hunt containers overseas to deliver on company commitment to grow capacity. (Photo: Business Wire)

The Johnnie Bryan, a second cargo vessel, is expected to dock at the Port of Hueneme in California next month with additional new containers. The two are part of a long-term, multi-vessel service agreement between J.B. Hunt and Swire Shipping Pte. Ltd. that will help expedite the overseas transport of new company containers and provide customers with a unique solution for accelerating international cargo movement from Asia.

""This is yet another example of our people listening to the needs of customers and developing a creative solution to efficiently deliver on their capacity needs,"" said John Roberts, president and CEO of J.B. Hunt. ""It is our honor to name two of the vessels helping us charter new waters this year after the original visionaries who knew the potential of what our company could be.""

Under the agreement, J.B. Hunt will have ongoing cargo shipping opportunities available from the Shenzhen, Qingdao and Shanghai markets in China to ports in California and the Pacific Northwest. The planned moves will help customers alleviate supply chain challenges such as equipment dislocation and fluidity, dwell time and demurrage by streamlining the ocean transport and transloading process.

""We’re really solving for two very big challenges with this agreement,"" said Darren Field, president of intermodal and executive vice president at J.B. Hunt. ""First, we’re adding intermodal capacity, which will provide customers with more opportunity to leverage the cost-savings and sustainability benefits that J.B. Hunt Intermodal offers. Second, we’re greatly reducing the time it takes for customers’ freight originating overseas to be out for delivery in the U.S., something that has troubled the industry for years.""

Story continues

Along with the support of additional vessel capacity, the Johnelle and Johnnie Bryan will continue transporting new J.B. Hunt containers overseas as they become available, delivering on the company’s commitment to grow its intermodal fleet to as many as 150,000 containers in the next three-to-five years. J.B. Hunt’s industry-leading intermodal fleet currently includes more than 109,000 53’-containers and 6,000 tractors.

Intermodal service offers both cost savings and sustainability benefits when compared to traditional over the road transport, reducing a shipment’s carbon emissions by as much as 60%. In 2021, J.B. Hunt avoided an estimated 3.5 million metric tons of CO2e emissions by converting over-the-road loads to intermodal. The company’s industry-leading J.B. Hunt 360°® digital freight marketplace was one of the first to integrate intermodal service options and continues to expand efficiency capabilities.

BURLINGTON, Mass. & FRANKLIN, Tenn., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tufts Medicine, a leading Massachusetts consumer oriented health system, and Acadia Healthcare Company, the largest standalone provider of behavioral health services in the U.S., announced today that they are forming a joint venture to build a 144-bed inpatient behavioral health facility on the site of the former Malden Hospital in Malden, Mass. The facility will address the critical need for accessible, high-quality inpatient behavioral health services for patients of all ages in the Greater Boston area.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220630005619/en/

""There is a critical need for capacity in behavioral health in the Commonwealth. Our plans to redevelop the Malden Hospital site into a state-of-the-art behavioral health hospital will help address the constraints on access to care that our health care providers and our patients and families face every day,"" said Michael Dandorph, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Medicine. ""We are proud of the services that MelroseWakefield Hospital and Lawrence Memorial Hospital have provided and these plans expand upon the legacy of high-quality, compassionate care they have long delivered to patients.""

Representing a $65 million investment in the community, the proposed 144-bed hospital will provide the latest in inpatient and intensive outpatient behavioral health care programs for its patients, addressing the continuum of care needed to support the wellbeing of patients and their families. As a new construction, the facility will replace the Malden Hospital building and tout a smaller footprint than the existing structure. The project will also set aside more than nine acres of land for conservation and open space, creating lasting benefits for the communities of Malden and Medford.

With a proven track record of collaborating with health systems across the country, Acadia Healthcare maintains a commitment to patient- and family-centered care and strong clinical outcomes.

""Acadia is extremely pleased to be partnering with a premier integrated healthcare system like Tufts Medicine, and one who shares in our mission and values,"" said Christopher Hunter, Chief Executive Officer for Acadia Healthcare. ""We look forward to creating this modern, patient-centered facility that will provide life-saving services to individuals and families throughout the region. The new hospital will also be a center of excellence for teaching the next generation of clinicians and staff so we can serve the community for many years to come.""

""We are committed to serving the needs of our communities and are excited about our plans to offer state-of-the-art resources in a modern facility that support our dedication to providing quality, compassionate care,"" said Daniel Carlat, MD, Medical Director of Inpatient Psychiatry and Chair of Psychiatry at MelroseWakefield Hospital. ""Hundreds of patients, including adolescents, are boarding in emergency departments for days due to insufficient psychiatric inpatient bed capacity. We are honored to have the opportunity to expand our programs and services to address behavioral health capacity constraints and community need through partnership with a nationally recognized expert in behavioral health who shares our mission and values for high-quality care.""

The project will go through a local and regulatory review process. Once it is complete, MelroseWakefield Hospital and Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford will consolidate their inpatient behavioral health services at the new hospital. The combination of services will contribute to the new center of excellence of comprehensive inpatient care, and the partnership will look to augment current services by developing innovative care delivery models to better integrate behavioral health services.

Tufts Medicine and MelroseWakefield Hospital will be engaging with the community throughout the process, including holding a community meeting to provide more information about the project, answer questions from residents, and hear community feedback.

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:00+00:00,"VGP Announces the Signature of its First Acquisition Project in France, with VALGO","VGP NV

PRESS RELEASE

Regulated Information

June 30, 2022, 18:00 CET, Petit-Couronne, France: VGP NV (“VGP” or “the Group”) and VALGO signed an agreement to purchase 32 hectares of land that housed the former Petroplus refining units in Petit-Couronne, near Rouen. This brownfield rehabilitation project is fully in line with VGP's core expertise and strategy. Thanks to the six years ownership of the site by VALGO and its expertise in asbestos removal, soil and water table decontamination, in-situ waste treatment and development, this area has now become a suitable site for the development of new industries and business activities.

On the banks of the river Seine and close to the A13 highway, the 32-hectare area of land offers its future users a highly strategic location. Following the extensive depollution work carried out by VALGO, the site is now ready for redevelopment. VGP expanded into France only a few months ago and is delighted to start its French business activities in the dynamic Rouen Normandy metropolis area, via this major project. In total, around 150,000 m² of land are set to be redeveloped to accommodate industrial and logistics projects, with work due to begin in 2023.

Collaboration with local authorities is an absolute priority for the Group, since development projects directly impact their surroundings. In Petit-Couronne, the revitalization of this brownfield site will therefore be an opportunity to help stimulate the area in terms of employment and so meet the economic and environmental challenges of the Rouen region. Aurélien Coudert, General Manager of VGP France, is delighted that the Group’s first steps in France are being taken in partnership with VALGO and is convinced by the attractiveness of the region and its development potential.

VGP and VALGO are also joining forces to implement an ambitious and innovative environmental policy. Through a policy of innovation serving clients and geographies, VGP puts the challenges of energy efficiency, carbon footprint reduction and sustainable buildings at the heart of its projects. The company is committed to being carbon neutral by 2025 and is also aiming for BREEAM Excellent building certification, as well as green energy production on its projects. In addition, the VGP Foundation, created in 2019, already supports 29 projects that address issues around access to education, biodiversity preservation and the protection of cultural heritage.

Story continues

Jan Van Geet, CEO VGP:
“VGP is delighted to begin its business activities in France on a site as exceptional as this one, with strong economic and environmental ambitions that are shared by both our partner, VALGO, and the local authorities. As the rehabilitation of brownfield sites is at the heart of our business, this project is a great opportunity for us to deploy our industrial and logistical know-how. The uncertain geopolitical situation and the rise in transport prices mean that companies are increasingly looking for local support to start their business. In this context, we strongly believe in the relevance of our integrated model with a long-term vision. We are now eager to get to work and bring all the expertise of the Group to the project.""

François Bouché, CEO VALGO:
""We are delighted that this huge piece of land has been sold to a major investor with experience in redeveloping brownfields in Europe. However, I would first like to celebrate the work of the men and women who worked so hard to make this colossal project a success. It took more than 1 million hours and over €60 million in investment by VALGO to turn the page on over 80 years of refining on this site, which already employs 600 people.”

VGP is advised on this project by the legal practices Cheuvreux (Eric Hervy), Ireo (Marine Javelle) and EOL (Jean-François Mounic).

AAPL,2022-06-30T16:00:00+00:00,Do You Need to File a Tax Return on Living Trusts?,"SmartAsset: Does a Living Trust Need to File a Tax Return?

A living trust is a common solution for many people with estate planning needs. However, few people know about its tax-filing requirements. Generally, any trust with at least $600 in annual income must file a federal return. But for a revocable trust or a grantor trust that is controlled by the person who set it up, those owners must include the trust on personal returns and the trust itself doesn’t file. Here’s what you need to know.

A financial advisor could help you find answers to your trust and taxation questions.

Living Trust Basics

A living trust is one of several varieties of trusts often used in estate planning. A living trust is an instrument that can be used to control where one’s assets go either before or after death. It can help heirs skip probate, avoid conservatorship in the event of incapacitation and specify how assets will be left to minor children, among other things.

To set up a living trust, an attorney draws up the documents creating the trust. Then assets are transferred to the control of a trustee overseeing the trust. The trustee can the original owner of the assets, called the grantor, or someone else appointed by the grantor. The trustee is charged with managing the assets for the benefit of the named beneficiaries.

Living trusts come in a number of varieties. Transfer of assets to irrevocable trusts can’t be reversed. Revocable trusts allow the grantor to change or cancel the terms of the trust. Marital trusts are a type of irrevocable living trust allowing transfer of assets to a surviving spouse without taxation. Grantor trusts, in which the grantor retains control of assets are treated like revocable trusts for tax purposes.

Living Trust Tax Filing Requirements SmartAsset: Does a Living Trust Need to File a Tax Return?

A trust with more than $600 in income during a tax year is required to file a federal income tax return. The trustee files out a Form 1041 reporting the trust’s income. Even if it does not report $600 income, a trust must file a return if it has a non-resident alien as a beneficiary. However, there are exceptions to this rule.

Story continues

One exception to this rule is a grantor trust, one in which the grantor of the trust retains control over the assets in the trust. In the case of a grantor trust, the grantor has to report the trust’s income on his or her personal 1040. The grantor is also responsible for paying any taxes due on the trust’s income.

Another exception to the rule that living trusts must file tax returns is a revocable marital trust in which both spouses are living. In this case the income from the trust’s assets is reported on the spouses’ personal returns and the trust does not file a Form 1041.

When one spouse dies, however, things change. At that point, the portion of that spouse’s assets in a revocable living trust become irrevocable. The trust must file a Form 1041 for that year, reporting and paying taxes on the income from the deceased spouse’s portion of the assets. This is typically half the trust’s assets. Afterward, the irrevocable trust will file a return, subject to the income level requirements, every year.

Trusts also must provide a tax form called a Schedule K-1 and supply it to beneficiaries of the trust. This will sum up any funds the trust distributed to beneficiaries. The beneficiaries of the trust have to report any receipts from the trust on their own personal returns.

Bottom Line SmartAsset: Does a Living Trust Need to File a Tax Return?

Living trusts have to file tax returns in most cases if they have $600 or more in income for a given tax year. They may also have to file if the living trust is a grantor-controlled trust or a revocable marital trust and both spouses are still living. Trusts that file tax returns do so using Form 1041. However, the grantors of grantor-controlled and revocable trusts report the trust’s income on their own personal returns. Living trusts also supply Schedule K-1 forms to beneficiaries outlining and funds paid to them during the year as benefits.

Estate Planning Tips

Living trusts can be effective tools for estate planning, but they are best used with the help of a financial advisor. Finding one doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

Estate planning can be complex, and that’s especially true if you’re someone with significant wealth. To make sure you have everything you need, read up on the essential estate planning tools for wealthy investors. Inheritance isn’t usually considered income, but certain types of inherited assets can have tax implications. Before you spend or invest your inheritance, read more inheritance taxes and exemptions.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:58:35+00:00,"From Suncor to Shopify, Canada Stocks Whipsaw on Recession Fears","(Bloomberg) -- This was supposed to be a blowout year for Canadian equities, benefiting from soaring commodity prices and a forceful post-pandemic rebound in consumer spending. Instead, the country’s benchmark index is slumping amid the global stock selloff, though not as badly as its US counterpart.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Democrats Weigh Paring Biden Tax Hike to Win Over Manchin Trump’s Final Scene Didn’t Go According to Script Venice Plans to Start Weeding Out Cheap Tourists Bonds Rally on Recession Fears; Stocks Fluctuate: Markets Wrap Fauci Suffers Covid Symptom Rebound After Course of Pfizer’s Paxlovid

The S&P/TSX Composite Index declined 11% in the first half of 2022 as recession fears weighed on the value-heavy market, outperforming the S&P 500 Index, which fell more than 20%. Underscoring the market effects of inflation, Suncor Energy, one of Canada’s largest energy companies, soared 41%, while Shopify Inc. plunged, losing about C$170 billion ($132 billion) in market capitalization.

Here’s a look at some of the standout stock movers of the first half:

Once Canada’s most valuable publicly traded company, Shopify has sunk 77% this year amid a broad selloff in technology stocks and slowing e-commerce traffic. The tumble makes the beleaguered stock and the S&P/TSX Information Technology Sector Index the market’s worst performers. Even Shopify’s 10-for-1 stock split on Wednesday wasn’t enough to drum up investor interest, with the share price falling on the news.

Soaring oil prices boosted energy stocks, which are up 24% this year. Oil and gas stocks may have more room to run. Earnings in the sector are expected to skyrocket, with the blended forward 12-month average earnings per share expected to jump 59%, compared with 30% for the S&P/TSX and 20% for the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data.

Nine of the top 10 performers on the S&P/TSX are energy stocks, with Spartan Delta Corp. and Athabasca Oil Corp. leading gains with 107% and 104% increases respectively.

Story continues

Meanwhile, financial stocks have spiraled as rising interest rates and record inflation spook investors. Banks and insurers, which make up nearly one-third of the broader market, have weighed on the benchmark.

Canada’s largest lenders were down 20% last week from their record high in February and have continued to hover near that territory. If a recession ravages markets, heavyweight financials could take another chunk out of the index. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto Dominion Bank led the losses, all falling more than 13% in the first half.

The Canadian market started off the year strong, climbing as investors pivoted away from growth stocks toward value. As recession fears set in, the benchmark has descended further into the red while maintaining its outperformance over US equities.

The S&P/TSX has handily beat the S&P 500 Index this year, and many market strategists expect the index to end the year by outperforming its US counterpart for the first time since 2016 -- so long as the economy avoids a downturn into a recession and oil demand remains high.

TELL to provide electric-powered compressor technology for the latter's $16.8-billion natural gas transmission pipeline project in Louisiana.

This will be the first time Baker Hughes will install its Integrated Compressor Line (“ICL”) decarbonization technology for pipeline compression in North America.

In 2019, Tellurian received approval from U.S. energy regulators to begin site preparation activities for the project. Tellurian will spend $240 million in the project’s first phase, which involves dual pipelines to be developed as Line 200 and Line 300.

The project will comprise four 19-megawatt ICL compressors and turbomachinery for four compressor trains. Beside this, it will consist of a gas turbine, which will be used as a backup energy source in the initial phase of the pipeline’s operation.

The project is expected to supply 5.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, with no emissions. The pipelines are designed to meet demand in a capacity-constrained region of southwest Louisiana. Notably, the project is expected to provide low-carbon gas to customers in the Calcasieu and Beauregard districts of Louisiana.

Tellurian is making the initial pipeline investment as part of the broader Driftwood Pipeline system, which will provide improved security of energy supplies to meet the area’s industrial growth in a cleaner and sustainable way. Tellurian, along with Baker Hughes, will deliver cleaner solutions to meet the global energy demand.

Technology is a key driver for the renewable energy transition. Baker Hughes’ low-carbon ICL technology is already lowering the carbon footprint of pipeline projects in many regions, which deliver essential gas supplies. With the latest deal, the company is bringing it to North America, a region crucial to meeting global natural gas demand.

Specifically, CFG’s board of directors increased the common share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. This indicates an increase of $545 million over the $455-million remaining capacity under the $750-million January 2021 authorization.

The company also noted that its board of directors would consider hiking the quarterly common stock dividend for third-quarter 2022.

John F. Woods, vice chairman and chief financial officer, noted, “We are pleased that the Federal Reserve’s stress test results illustrate Citizens’ strong capital position and the resilience of our balance sheet and business model.”

Citizens Financial is focused on maintaining a strong capital base. As of Mar 31, 2022, the company’s Basel III capital ratios exceeded regulatory requirements, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio and a total capital ratio of 9.7% and 12.5%, respectively. For 2022, management expects a CET1 ratio of 9.75-10%

Also, it remains committed to enhancing shareholders' value. In January 2020, the company increased its common stock dividend by 8%.

As of Mar 31, 2022, Citizens Financial held long-term borrowed funds worth $5.9 billion, which has been witnessing a declining trend over the past few quarters. As of the same date, its total available liquidity (including cash and due from banks, and interest-bearing cash and due from banks) stood at $9.9 billion.

Given CFG’s steadily improving performance and strong liquidity position, its capital deployment activities are sustainable.

CFG has also been growing through acquisitions. In April, Citizens Financial completed the acquisition of Investors Bancorp for $3.39 billion, which strengthened its banking franchise and boosted the consumer customer base. This February, it closed the acquisition of 80 East Coast branches and the national online deposit business from HSBC. The acquisitions of Investors Bancorp, combined with the HSBC branches, create a strong franchise in the greater New York City and Philadelphia Metro areas, and New Jersey by adding 234 branches.

Story continues

Apart from this, the acquisitions have strengthened the company’s balance sheet, creating a strong foundation for revenue growth. This, too, is likely to make capital deployment activities sustainable.

So far this year, shares of CFG have lost 23.5% compared with a 16.8% decline of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Investment Research

Suniewick was most recently president of distribution and business development for NBCU’s digital properties. She is credited with leading a number of the company’s digital investments, including those in Snap Inc. and Vox Media Inc., according to a statement from Twitter.

The new hire comes at a tumultuous time for Twitter, which is in the process of completing a $44 billion takeover deal with billionaire Elon Musk. Musk has pledged to deliver significant changes once he takes Twitter private, including adjusting its moderation policies and expanding the social service’s reach to wider audiences. Twitter has implemented a number of cost-cutting measures in recent weeks, but it has said it will make exceptions to its pause in hiring for business-critical roles.

“There’s so much more we can do to improve the timeline with incredible content, to drive usage of our developer platform, and to deepen our work with technology, media, sports and entertainment partners,” said Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal. Suniewick will report to Segal in her new role.

ECPG stock looks like an attractive investment option now. Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates this year to tackle the red-hot inflation will be beneficial for consumer loan providers.

Given the rate hikes in March, May and mid-June, along with expectations of more this year, consumer loan providers are expected to witness solid improvement in their top lines and margins. Thus, adding one such company to your portfolio seems to be a good decision right now.

ECPG has also been witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions of late, reflecting analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 earnings has been revised 57.5% upward. Thus, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Looking at its price performance, shares of Encore Capital have gained 20.1% over the past year against a decline of 28% recorded by the industry. Zacks Investment Research

Some other factors mentioned below make Encore Capital stock an attractive investment option now.

Earnings per Share (EPS) Growth: The company witnessed EPS growth of 33.6% in the last three to five years, higher than the industry average of 19.6%. The upward trend is expected to continue in the near term. ECPG’s earnings are projected to grow 14.4% in 2022.

It also has an impressive earnings surprise history. ECPG’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 80.4%.

Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Encore Capital’s ROE is 33.89% compared with the industry average of 18.66%. This indicates that it reinvests its cash more efficiently than the industry.

Favorable Valuation: The company seems to be trading at a discount with respect to its price/earnings (P/E) and price/sales (P/S) ratios. Currently, it has a P/E (F1) ratio of 4.52, which is below the industry average of 5.52. Also, its P/S ratio of 0.83 compares favorably with the industry average of 1.15.

Moreover, the stock currently has a Value Score of A. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of “value traps” and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:53:03+00:00,Fulton Financial (FULT) to Scrap NSF Fees for Consumer Accounts,"In an effort to support its customers, Fulton Financial Corporation FULT announced modifications to its overdraft program and fee schedule. FULT’s subsidiary, Fulton Bank, has announced that it would eliminate non-sufficient funds (NSF) and extended overdraft fees for its consumer customers in fourth-quarter 2022.

Andy Fiol, the head of Consumer Banking at Fulton Bank, said, “We’ve received consumer customer feedback and this is another way we’re responding and helping. This is just one of several changes we’ve made or are making to meet customers’ needs and expectations regarding overdraft fees.”

Notably, NSF fee is a charge imposed on customers when their checks bounce or when automated withdrawals lead to an overdraft in their accounts. Customers generally do not have funds to cover a transaction or purchase. Hence, the removal of such fees elevates customers’ financial strength.

In order to meet customer needs, FULT has continuously been adapting its products and services. In 2021, Fulton Bank launched “Xpress Account,” which is a checkless account that offers consumer customers many of the benefits of a checking account without overdraft or NSF fees, with a low monthly maintenance charge.

The Xpress Account is certified under the BankOn National Account Standards, which are designed to encourage financial institutions to provide consumers with access to safe and affordable checking accounts.

Fiol added, “We will continue to evaluate our consumer products, services and fee schedule to ensure we are providing industry-leading services to our consumer customers while, at the same time, continuing to change lives for the better.”

So far this year, shares of FULT have lost 13.3% compared with the 17.5% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment Research

Our Take

Recently, banks have been facing increased scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for charging overdraft and other fees from consumers. Several U.S. consumer banks have been asked to eliminate all consumer overdraft fees to safeguard customers. Fulton Financial’s actions align with such requests and bode well for the company in the long run.

Similar to FULT, banks like Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C have stopped charging NSF and overdraft fees.

In January, Bank of America announced changes to its overdraft services, including plans to do away with NSF fees, effective February, and lower overdraft fees to $10 from $35, beginning in May. The company also removed transfer fees associated with its Balance Connect for overdraft protection service in May.

Since 2010, BAC has taken several steps to “empower its consumer and small business clients to bank with greater confidence and reduce overdraft usage.” These efforts have substantially lowered fees related to overdrafts. Such steps, beside SafeBalance accounts with no overdraft fees and Balance Assist, will reduce overdraft fee revenues by 97% from 2009 levels.

In February, Citigroup announced that it would completely terminate overdraft fees, return item fees and overdraft protection fees by this summer, making it the largest U.S. lender to do so.

Citigroup’s overdraft fee collection has been among the lowest compared with its peers. Other than a consumer-friendly overdraft policy, the banking giant continues to expand access to banking products and services, making banking more financially inclusive for the underserved communities.

Endo is knee-deep in trouble with several litigation suits over opioid sales that have caused shares to underperform for quite some time.

The company’s unfavorable debt profile has also been a headwind. As of Mar 31, 2022, the company’s debt to total capital ratio was 119.4% compared unfavorably with the industry’s 43.6%.

Endo has also been negotiating with its lenders and senior bondholders about possibly restructuring more than $8 billion of debt.

Per a Bloomberg article, Endo’s senior leaders have advocated for the company to file a bankruptcy to survive this turmoil. They have also suggested that Endo skip paying the upcoming interests to shareholders to preserve company cash.

Since the bulk of the due interests will be collected by junior bondholders, they want Endo to restructure the debt out of court.

In the year-to-date period, Endo’s shares have plunged 86.1% in the year so far compared with the industry's 22.5% decline.

Endo rallied 85% on Jun 28 due to the sudden demand surge for women’s contraceptives across the United States. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The demand surge for birth control pills was a reaction to the U.S Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, announced on Jun 24.

Endo’s subsidiaries Par Pharmaceutical, which markets birth control pills, Previfem, and Palladin Labs, which produces Plan B pills, a type of emergency birth control pill, saw a rise in demand for its products post the ruling.

Overturning this landmark deal has women across the U.S. stocking up on emergency contraceptives, opening up an opportunity for biomed firms focusing on women’s health and contraception needs, such as Evofem Biosciences EVFM

Shares of Evofem Biosciences rallied 160% on Jun 27, continuing a surge that began after the decision on Roe v. Wade was out. However, its gains have now stabilized.

Story continues

Evofem is known for Phexxi, a non-hormone contraceptive gel that prevents pregnancy by altering the users’ PH level, demonstrated to be 93% effective in FDA trials.

Amid the massive setback in women’s reproductive rights, Evofem has attracted the attention of investors, who believe the company has the potential to fill the gap as abortion becomes illegal in the United States.

BBBY plunged 23.6% at the close of the trading session on Jun 29, following the drab first-quarter fiscal 2022 results. Both top and bottom lines not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined year over year.

Results were affected by the ongoing macro-economic environment, the shift in customer preference, rising inflation, supply-chain challenges, and significant dislocation in sales and inventory.

In a bid to address the headwinds, management announced significant changes in senior leadership. In doing so, the company named Sue Gove, an independent director of its board and chair of the board's strategy committee, as its interim chief executive officer. The move comes after the exit of the earlier president and chief executive officer, Mark Tritton.

Earlier, under Tritton’s leadership, the company undertook a transformation strategy to stay afloat. As part of it, BBBY divested its non-core assets, invested in technology, infrastructure and digital capabilities, and launched Owned Brands.

Consequently, shares of BBBY have plunged 77.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 19.7%. Zacks Investment Research

That said, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains committed to serving as a one-stop destination for home solutions. It is also focused on top-tier execution, cost management efforts, improved supply-chain reliability, better capital spending, robust digital capabilities and a stronger balance sheet.

Currently, it is adjusting its supply-chain infrastructure and cost structure to reflect lower sales. Also, the company halted its new store and remodel programs for the rest of fiscal 2022.

In another development, the company remains on track with evaluating options for the potential sale of buybuy BABY. It has been able to identify certain strategies to increase the synergies and growth potential of the brand.

Q1 in Detail

Bed Bath & Beyond reported an adjusted loss of $2.83 per share in the fiscal first quarter against earnings of 5 cents in the year-ago quarter. The figure was also wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.33.

Net sales of $1,463 million declined 25% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,514 million. This might be due to muted demand for household goods and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Comparable sales (comps) fell 23% year over year. For stores, comps declined 24% year over year, while the same dropped 21% across the digital channel.

The Bed Bath & Beyond banner’s comparable sales fell 27% year over year, owing to sluggish demand in the Home sector and rapid changes in consumer spending patterns. These include Bedding, Bath, Kitchen Food Prep, Indoor décor, and Home Organization, representing two-thirds of the total Bed Bath & Beyond banner sales. The company’s buybuy BABY banner’s comparable sales declined year over year in the mid-single digits.

The adjusted gross profit slumped 48.9% to $348.1 million in the fiscal first quarter. However, the adjusted gross margin contracted 1110 basis points (bps) to 23.8%, including transient costs related to the 620-bps unfavorable impact of markdown inventory reserves and the 220-bps negative impact of supply chain-related port fees.

Excluding the transient costs, the metric came in at 32.2%.  However, the company has been working with suppliers and accelerating markdowns to right-size inventory levels.

SG&A expenses slumped 3.2% to $637.5 million in the reported quarter, driven by reduced costs stemming from lower rent and occupancy expenses. Adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 990 bps year over year to 43.6% due to lower sales.

Adjusted EBITDA was negative $224 million against $86.1 million reported in the year-ago period. The decline was mainly due to sluggish sales and dismal margins. The adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1090 bps year over year to 15.3%.

Financial Position

Bed Bath & Beyond ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and investments of $107.5 million. Long-term debt totaled $1,379.9 million and total shareholders' deficit was $220.3 million as of May 28, 2022. It also had strong liquidity of $0.9 billion as of May 28, 2022.

In the fiscal first quarter, cash used in operating activities was $383.6 million and capital expenditure was $104.9 million. For fiscal 2022, capital expenditure is expected to be $300 million, down from the earlier mentioned $400 million.

Store Updates

In the reported quarter, the company opened five buybuy BABY stores, while shutting down two Bed Bath & Beyond stores and one Harmon store.

As of May 28, 2022, the company had 955 stores in operation, comprising 769 namesake stores across 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 135 buybuy BABY stores; and 51 stores under Harmon, Harmon Face Values or Face Values names. Additionally, the company’s joint venture operates 12 flagship stores in Mexico.

Looking Ahead

Management issued a fiscal 2022 view. The company expects comparable sales in the second half of fiscal 2022 to improve on a sequential basis, driven by inventory optimization plans, including incremental clearance activity. Adjusted SG&A expenses are predicted to decline year over year on aggressive cost-cutting actions.

Lavazza said on Thursday that it was in “constructive and open” discussions with UK retailers after the cost for its green beans had risen as much as 80% in a year.

The Italian coffee company warned that inflationary pressures were set to remain until at least the end of next year but that it was working hard to absorb costs instead of passing them onto customers.

The cost of a 1kg bag of Lavazza whole beans rose by around £2 over the last 14 to 16 months in UK supermarkets.

“We are all facing tough times,” Lavazza’s UK general manager Pietro Mazza told The Press Association (PA).

“The situation is troubling and will be for some time, so we need to keep the conversation with retailers as free and open as possible.”

He highlighted that it was retailers who set the retail price of Lavazza products rather than the company itself.

He added: “It has been very tough in terms of supply – for green beans and for the components of our equipment. We have seen an 80% average increase in the cost of green beans in a year.”

The firm said instant coffee still made up more than 60% of the UK market, but sales of beans had grown 30% over the last three years.

It comes as US food giant Kraft Heinz has seen its products removed from Tesco (TSCO.L) shelves in a dispute over pricing.

Tesco, which has an over 27% share of Britain's grocery market, apologised for the absence of popular Kraft Heinz products, such as baked beans and tomato ketchup, from its shelves but said: ""We will not pass on unjustifiable price increases to our customers.""

A spokesperson for Kraft Heinz said it was working closely with Tesco to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.

""We are confident of a positive resolution,"" they said.

GBT initiated its planned phase II/III study on its next-generation sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization inhibitor, GBT02160 (GBT601) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).

Global Blood Therapeutics has initiated the phase II portion of the phase II/III study to identify the optimal safe and effective dose of GBT601 for the pivotal phase III portion of the trial

Per the company, GBT601 has the potential to improve on the clinical results achieved with Oxbryta, the company’s oral once-daily treatment for SCD, at a lower daily dose

The phase II portion of the study will enroll up to 60 patients with SCD between 18 and 65 years of age. The study’s primary outcome measure is the number of participants with a change from baseline in Hb through Week 12. After the optimal dose is selected, the phase III portion will assess the efficacy and safety of the dose compared with placebo in adult and pediatric SCD patients for 48 weeks.

The company expects initial data from the phase II/III study before the end of the year.

Shares of Global Blood have gained 10.3% year to date against the industry’s decline of 22.9%.

Last December, Global Blood reported positive results from its phase I study of GBT601. The data demonstrated average Hb occupancy greater than 30% and improvements in hematologic parameters in a cohort of six patients with SCD receiving multiple ascending doses (MAD) of GBT601.

The study also showed that single ascending doses (SAD) and MAD of GBT601 were well tolerated in both SCD patients and healthy volunteers.

GBT also restarted the phase I study of GBT601 to study a 150-mg daily dose, increasing over the 100-mg daily maintenance dose previously studied.

Earlier this month, Global Blood announced that the FDA had granted both orphan drugs and rare pediatric designations to GBT601 for treating SCD.

STZ has reported a solid start to fiscal 2023, with better-than-expected sales and earnings in the fiscal first quarter. The metrics also improved year over year.

On a reported basis, the company’s earnings per share were $2.06, up 143% year over year.

Net sales rose 17% to $2,363.2 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,188 million. Sales benefited from robust growth in the beer business as well as improved sales in the wine and spirits business.

The company’s beer business reported sales growth of 21% to $1,898.2 million, including a 17.3% increase in shipment volumes and 8.7% depletion growth. Sales growth for the segment was driven by robust consumer demand for its iconic brands. Depletion volume benefited from the continued robust performance of Modelo Especial and resilient growth in Corona Extra.

Depletion volume increased more than 15% for Modelo Especial and more than 4% for Corona Extra. Modelo Especial continued to be the No. 1 beer brand in the high-end category, strengthening its leadership position. It was also the largest share gainer in dollar sales in the U.S. beer category in IRI channels. Meanwhile, Corona Extra was the second-leading import share gainer and ranked the third brand in the high-end IRI channels.

Sales in the wine and spirits segment rose 2% to $465 million in the fiscal first quarter. Organic net sales for the segment grew 5%. The sales improvement was driven by shipment and depletion growth for the segment. Shipment volume in the wine and spirits business was up 1.5%, whereas depletions improved 1.2%. Depletion growth for the segment can be attributed to double-digit gains for Meiomi, The Prisoner Wine Company, High West Whiskey and Casa Noble Tequila.

Margins

The adjusted gross profit grew 12% year over year to $1230.6 million. Meanwhile, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 52.1%.

Constellation Brands' comparable operating income rose 10% to $792.5 million, whereas the comparable operating margin contracted 220 bps to 33.5%.

The operating margin in the beer segment contracted 260 bps to 40.2% due to higher cost of goods sold (“COGS”), stemming from increased raw material, transportation, brewery and depreciation costs. This was partly offset by favorable pricing, positive foreign currency impacts, and reduced marketing and SG&A expense rate.

The wine and spirits segment’s operating margin contracted 330 bps to 19.6%, owing to a planned increase in marketing spend, higher SG&A expenses, and higher COGS stemming from elevated raw material and transportation costs. This was partly offset by gains from favorable pricing and mix.

Financial Position

As of May 31, 2022, Constellation Brands’ cash and cash equivalent were $101.8 million, with long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $10,278.2 million and total shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interest) of $11,231.4 million.

Outlook

Following the first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, Constellation Brands updated its fiscal 2023 view. The company expects comparable earnings of $11.20-$11.50 on a comparable basis (excluding canopy growth impacts). The company expects earnings of $10.50-$10.80 per share on a reported basis compared with the $11.15-$11.45 mentioned earlier. These suggest improvements from comparable earnings (excluding canopy growth impacts) of $10.99 and a reported loss of 22 cents in the prior year.

Net sales are likely to increase 7-9% for the beer segment. Operating income is anticipated to increase 2-4%. The company expects net sales for the wine and spirits business to decline 1-3%, while the operating income is envisioned to grow 4-6%.

The company expects the tax rate to be 21.5% on a reported basis and 20% on a comparable basis for fiscal 2023. It anticipates average diluted shares outstanding of 186.5 million.

The company outlined plans for incremental capacity expansion in Mexico to support growth in its high-end Mexican beer portfolio. It anticipates a total capital expenditure of $5-$5.5 billion for the beer business between fiscal 2023 and 2026. The latest expansion will support an additional capacity of 30 million hectoliters of modular capacity and includes the construction of a brewery in Southeast Mexico in Veracruz.

Ignatova, who is also known as the self-appointed ""crypto queen,"" has been accused of scamming her victims out of $4 billion with her fraudulent scheme.  After marketing her sham cryptocurrency worldwide, the Bulgarian-born German citizen disappeared with stolen money back in 2017. Her current whereabouts remain unknown. Investigators have been trying to track her down for years to no avail.  The North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) State Police Force has suggested that she may have surgically altered her appearance. The authorities are also speculating that she could be heavily armed.  There is also a theory that Ignatova might be dead, which is why she has managed to escape justice for so long.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:45:03+00:00,Why Sun Communities (SUI) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.

Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.

Sun Communities in Focus

Headquartered in Southfield, Sun Communities (SUI) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -23.85% so far this year. The real estate investment trust is paying out a dividend of $0.88 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.2% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.05% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.73%.

Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.52 is up 6% from last year. In the past five-year period, Sun Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.53%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Sun Communities's current payout ratio is 54%, meaning it paid out 54% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.

SUI is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $7.31 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.29%.

Bottom Line

Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.

High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SUI is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price.

Ameriprise Financial Services in Focus

Headquartered in Minneapolis, Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -20.44% so far this year.

Ameriprise Financial Services has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.61%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Ameriprise's current payout ratio is 19%, meaning it paid out 19% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.

Looking at this fiscal year, AMP expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $25.49 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 12.04%.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:45:03+00:00,This is Why  Independent Bank Group (IBTX) is a Great Dividend Stock,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.

While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.

Independent Bank Group in Focus

Independent Bank Group (IBTX) is headquartered in Mckinney, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -6.44% since the start of the year. The bank holding company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.38 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.25%. This compares to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.18% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.73%.

In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.52 is up 15.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, Independent Bank Group has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 34.10%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Independent Bank Group's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.

Earnings growth looks solid for IBTX for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $5.25 per share, with earnings expected to increase 0.19% from the year ago period.

Bottom Line

Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.

High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that IBTX is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

VINCI awarded contract for the Penlink project in north Auckland, New Zealand

Conception and construction of a new 7km road, including New Zealand first extradosed1 bridgeContract worth NZD 510 million (€305 million)

Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency have appointed HEB Construction, a VINCI Construction subsidiary based in New Zealand, as part of the consortium formed with Fulton Hogan, Aurecon, Tonkin + Taylor, for the design and construction of the Penlink project in north Auckland. The Penlink project will provide a vital connection in the region that will provide better, safer and more reliable transport options. The contract is an “Alliance” type, creating an integrated team including the designer-constructor consortium and Waka Kotahi.

The NZD 510 million (€305 million) project will include the construction of a 7km two-lane highway with a separate shared path for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as six bridges, including New Zealand’s first extradosed bridge.

The design and construction chosen methodologies will allow a reduction of up to 20% of carbon emissions compared to a traditional design. A lowered entrance to the 550m extradosed bridge will better fit with the landscape and enable 235m to be trimmed off the overall crossing, reducing the amount of steel and concrete required. The crossing was designed with a reduced number of piers in the Wēiti River from three to two to reduce the environmental impact.

The alliance has worked on improving the recycling of construction materials, utilising renewable energy sources, and harvesting rainwater.

VINCI va réaliser le projet routier du Penlink au nord d’Auckland (Nouvelle-Zélande)

Conception et construction d’une route de 7 km incluant le premier pont extradossé1 du paysUn contrat de 510 millions de dollars néo-zélandais (305 millions d’euros)

L’agence au transport néo-zélandaise Waka Kotahi a attribué à HEB Construction - filiale de VINCI Construction en Nouvelle-Zélande - en groupement avec Fulton Hogan, Aurecon et Tonkin + Taylor, le contrat de conception et construction du projet Penlink au nord d’Auckland. Le contrat, de type “alliance”, associe dans une même équipe le groupement concepteur-constructeur et le client.

Cette infrastructure constituera une connexion majeure dans la région, améliorant la sûreté et la fiabilité de l’offre de mobilité aux usagers.

Le projet, d’une valeur de 510 millions de dollars néo-zélandais (305 millions d’euros) comprend la construction d’une nouvelle voie rapide à 2x2 voies de 7 km, complétée d’une voie à mobilité partagée pour piétons et cyclistes, ainsi que la construction de six ponts, dont le premier pont extradossé de Nouvelle-Zélande.

La conception et les méthodes de construction retenues permettront de réduire les émissions carbone jusqu’à 20 % par rapport à une conception classique. L'entrée abaissée du pont extradossé de 550 mètres s'intègrera au paysage tout en réduisant de 235 mètres la longueur totale du pont et, de fait, la quantité d'acier et de béton utilisée. La traverse a été conçue avec deux piles au lieu de trois dans la rivière Wēiti.

Le groupement s’est engagé à favoriser le recyclage des matériaux, l’utilisation des sources d'énergie renouvelables et la récupération des eaux de pluie.

La construction sera menée en protégeant la faune et la flore locales grâce à des études en amont et à une surveillance continue pendant toute la durée des travaux qui devraient s’achever en 2026.

Le tablier du pont est supporté à la fois par des câbles de précontrainte intérieurs au béton, et des câbles extérieurs au béton. Il en résulte une conception globalement plus efficace pour des ponts de moyenne et longue portée.

VINCI awarded contract for the Penlink project in north Auckland, New Zealand

Conception and construction of a new 7km road, including New Zealand first extradosed1 bridge Contract worth NZD 510 million (€305 million)

Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency have appointed HEB Construction, a VINCI Construction subsidiary based in New Zealand, as part of the consortium formed with Fulton Hogan, Aurecon, Tonkin + Taylor, for the design and construction of the Penlink project in north Auckland. The Penlink project will provide a vital connection in the region that will provide better, safer and more reliable transport options. The contract is an “Alliance” type, creating an integrated team including the designer-constructor consortium and Waka Kotahi.

The NZD 510 million (€305 million) project will include the construction of a 7km two-lane highway with a separate shared path for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as six bridges, including New Zealand’s first extradosed bridge.

The design and construction chosen methodologies will allow a reduction of up to 20% of carbon emissions compared to a traditional design. A lowered entrance to the 550m extradosed bridge will better fit with the landscape and enable 235m to be trimmed off the overall crossing, reducing the amount of steel and concrete required. The crossing was designed with a reduced number of piers in the Wēiti River from three to two to reduce the environmental impact.

The alliance has worked on improving the recycling of construction materials, utilising renewable energy sources, and harvesting rainwater.

The Penlink design was also developed to protect a wide range of flora and fauna through preliminary investigations and continuous environment monitoring will be carried on until completion in late 2026.

I'm excited for my team's work to further emphasize Sensor Tower's status as the most trusted source of digital insights.""

""As Sensor Tower expands our operations and as our products and service offerings support more critical business decisions, it's a crucial time to introduce new voices and expertise to our executive leadership team,"" said Alex Malafeev, CEO and co-founder of Sensor Tower.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:41:03+00:00,Here's Why You Should Add MetLife (MET) to Your Portfolio Now,"MetLife, Inc. MET remains well-poised for growth, courtesy of sustained performance of variable investment income (VII), diversified product suite, cost-cutting efforts and strong liquidity stand.

Zacks Rank & Price Performance

MetLife carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) currently.

The stock has gained 4% over a year against the industry’s decline of 14.5%. The Zacks Finance sector has lost 13.5% in the said time frame. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 composite has declined 12%. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Favorable Style Score

MetLife carries an impressive Value Score of A. Value Score helps find stocks that are undervalued. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment bets.

Impressive Earnings Surprise History

MET boasts an impressive earnings surprise record. It has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 42.90%.

Northbound Estimate Revision

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 5.9% and 2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.

Valuation

Price-to-book (P/B) is one of the multiples used for valuing insurance stocks. Compared with the multiline industry’s trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.6, MetLife has a reading of 0.9. It is quite evident that the stock is currently undervalued.

Solid Return on Equity

The ROE of MetLife stands at 12% in the trailing 12 months, which remains higher than the industry average of 9.2%. This reflects MET’s efficiency in utilizing its shareholders’ funds.

Business Tailwinds

Margins of MetLife continue to benefit from strong VII. A recovering economy signaling an improving operating environment and interest rate hikes are expected to sustain the sound performance of the metric in the days ahead.

MetLife resorts to acquisitions and partnerships to boost its capabilities and strengthen its nationwide presence. Continuous product launches in different fields like MyPets rewards program, Structured Installment Sale solution, 360Health solution and others enable MET to foray into diverse streams of business. The multiline insurer makes constant efforts to keep pace with the ongoing digital trend, which has fueled noticeable demand for digital security benefits to the workforce. In February 2022, MetLife entered into an alliance with the renowned intelligent safety solutions provider Aura to distribute the latter’s digital security solutions within MET’s U.S. Group Benefits platform.

Story continues

MetLife continues to undertake prudent cost-cutting initiatives with an aim to provide a boost to the bottom line. As part of the same endeavor, MET expects the direct expense ratio to remain below the targeted figure of 12.3% for 2022. Meanwhile, it has been divesting underperforming businesses to intensify its focus on high-growth ones and generate increased free cash flows, which in turn will aid MetLife in pursuing several growth-related initiatives.

MetLife boasts of a strong financial position, supported by a sound cash balance sufficient enough to cover the short-term obligations of the multiline insurer and encouraging it to continuously pursue tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend hikes. In May 2022, MET approved a share repurchase program of $3 billion. Its dividend yield of 3.2% compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 2.5%.

Robust E-Commerce Initiatives

Walmart’s e-commerce business and omni-channel penetration have been increasing. From fiscal 2021 beginning till fiscal 2022 end, the company’s digital sales, as a percentage of sales, increased from 6% to 13%. The company has taken several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. The company is innovating in the supply chain, adding capacity and building businesses such as Walmart GoLocal, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart+, Spark Delivery, Marketplace, and Walmart Fulfillment Services. U.S. e-commerce sales rose 1% in the first quarter and soared 38% on a two-year stack basis. The company is witnessing rapid growth in advertising income. At Sam’s Club, e-commerce sales jumped 22% due to a robust direct-to-home show and solid curbside performance. In the International segment, e-commerce sales advanced by 22% on a constant-currency basis. Additionally, Walmart is aggressivelyexpanding in the booming online grocery space, which has long been a major contributor to e-commerce sales.

Wrapping Up

The industry is currently grappling with supply-chain bottlenecks and Walmart is not fully immune to these headwinds. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company posted soft first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings as it battled supply-chain bottlenecks, escalated costs and persistently elevated inflation. The company’s consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 87 basis points (bps), primarily due to Sam’s Club, wherein the gross margin fell 219 bps. This was attributable to supply-chain costs, a fuel mix, inflation and markdowns stemming from the delayed inventory. Management expects the gross margin to remain under pressure in the second quarter, though it will likely improve sequentially.

WMT’s stock has declined 15.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 13.3% fall.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:40:03+00:00,COLM vs. LULU: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?,"Investors looking for stocks in the Textile - Apparel sector might want to consider either Columbia Sportswear (COLM) or Lululemon (LULU). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.

Currently, Columbia Sportswear has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Lululemon has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that COLM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.

Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.

COLM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.41, while LULU has a forward P/E of 29.92. We also note that COLM has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. LULU currently has a PEG ratio of 1.50.

Another notable valuation metric for COLM is its P/B ratio of 2.52. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LULU has a P/B of 13.54.

Based on these metrics and many more, COLM holds a Value grade of B, while LULU has a Value grade of D.

COLM has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LULU, so it seems like value investors will conclude that COLM is the superior option right now.

These metrics, and several others, help CGEMY earn a Value grade of B, while EXLS has been given a Value grade of C.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:38:03+00:00,Here's Why You Should Hold UMB Financial (UMBF) Stock Now,"UMB Financial Corporation UMBF has a well-diversified operation aligned strategically to generate steady, consistent revenues. Most of its revenues come from its commercial banking division, followed by institutional banking and personal banking. Yet, the rising trend of operating expenses will remain a concern.

Its recent agreement to acquire the health savings account (HSA) business of Old National Bank will significantly expand UMBF’s direct-to-employer accounts and consequently enhance its revenue capabilities.

The company’s net loan and deposit growth is quite impressive. Over the past five years, net loans and deposits witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of 11% and 28%, respectively. With the recovery in the economy and resumption of business activities, the demand for loans is expected to improve in the upcoming period. Management expects a strong loan pipeline in the second quarter, positioning it for another quarter of solid growth.

UMB Financial’s capital deployment activities are encouraging. It has been raising dividends on a regular basis since 2002. In April 2022, it approved a share repurchase plan program of up to 2 million shares, valid until April 2023.

Last year, UMBF managed to lower its non-interest expenses. However, expenses are likely to be high due to the company’s investment in new technologies. Such increasing current costs might limit the bottom-line expansion.

Apart from technological expenditure, we believe that its declining capital position will inhibit any future proactive expansion. In fact, as of Mar 31, 2022, the total risk-based capital ratio was 13.55%, which declined from the prior-year quarter’s 14.28%.

With respect to liquidity, the company has been witnessing high debt load over the past few quarters, with the trend continuing in the first quarter. Cash and due from bank also witnessed a fall over the same time period. Though its operations are well-diversified, most of UMB Financial’s loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial and industrial loans, for which it may face tough competition.

Currently, UMBF carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past six months, shares of the company have declined 18.4% compared with the 14.6% fall recorded by the industry.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:37:08+00:00,Investors in Cannae Holdings (NYSE:CNNE) have unfortunately lost 42% over the last year,"The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in Cannae Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CNNE) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 42%. That's well below the market decline of 20%. Even if you look out three years, the returns are still disappointing, with the share price down33% in that time. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 18% in the last 90 days. However, one could argue that the price has been influenced by the general market, which is down 17% in the same timeframe.

Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.

Check out our latest analysis for Cannae Holdings

Because Cannae Holdings made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.

In the last twelve months, Cannae Holdings increased its revenue by 26%. That's definitely a respectable growth rate. Unfortunately that wasn't good enough to stop the share price dropping 42%. This implies the market was expecting better growth. However, that's in the past now, and it's the future that matters most.

You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth

It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for Cannae Holdings in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.

A Different Perspective

The last twelve months weren't great for Cannae Holdings shares, which performed worse than the market, costing holders 42%. Meanwhile, the broader market slid about 20%, likely weighing on the stock. The three-year loss of 10% per year isn't as bad as the last twelve months, suggesting that the company has not been able to convince the market it has solved its problems. Although Baron Rothschild famously said to ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", he also focusses on high quality stocks with solid prospects. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Cannae Holdings .

Cannae Holdings is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Temetra is the company’s cloud-based mobile meter data collection and management solution. The solution is designed to aid utility companies to gain access and modify meter data and assignments from anywhere through a web login, thereby eliminating the need to maintain local software installation.

Recently, Temetra was leveraged by Australia-based Energy Queensland to read meters for its 2.3 million strong user base stretched across rural and urban locations.

Temetra will aid in optimizing operations and enhancing route optimization and meter reading efficiencies for Energy Queensland. The solution will also enable utilities to accumulate, upload and store the meter data in real-time. Utilities can use analytics functionality to track and streamline their workload and meter routes using real-time data.

Employee safety is enhanced as the GIS-based data collection Android app sends hazard warnings and potential danger alerts before moving toward an electric meter.

However, pandemic-induced supply chain troubles and component shortages are limiting the company’s ability to capitalise on the robust customer demand. Sluggishness in the Device Solutions and Networked Solutions segment was a major concern. In the last reported quarter, revenues of $475.3 million declined 9% year over year.

Itron currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of ITRI have lost 51.2% against the industry’s decline of 24.9% in the past year.

The report evaluates drivers, growth-limiting factors, and opportunities to assist leading market players in determining factors that should be tapped on to achieve a long-lasting growth. Rise in concerns related to labor safety and human errors led to surge in implementation of ROS based robots in the industrial and automotive sectors. Moreover, increase in demand for productivity and quality at workplaces raised the demand for automated robots. These factors drive the growth of the global ROS based robot market. However, high setup costs of ROS based robots along with issues related to security and safety are some of the growth-limiting factors.

Highlighting the huge opportunities that lie ahead in the ROS based robot market, the Lead Analyst for the ICT & Media category at Next Move Strategy Consulting, said, “The emergence of Industry 4.0 and increase in investments in research and development activities in the robotics sector create lucrative opportunities for the market. Rise in implementation in end-use industries such as electronics, food & beverages and others also present unbounded opportunities.”

This is due to rise in implementation of automation in different industries, increase in need for robots in defense and security applications, and the requirement to address concerns related to labor safety and human errors. However, Europe is expected to register a steady growth during the forecast period, owing to increase in application in sectors such as logistic & warehouse, healthcare, agriculture, and others.

BRENTWOOD, Tenn., June 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tractor Supply Company, the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States, is celebrating the Fourth of July by honoring the men and women of the Armed Forces.

This year’s 50 gift-card recipients were selected based on need to support their agriculture projects and businesses and represented four branches of the military across 32 states. The supplementary $50,000 donation from the Tractor Supply Foundation will provide grants to seven additional farmer veterans and support FVC’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

This scholarship helped me focus on creating less stress for my final semester and I was able to graduate Summa Cum Laude with an honorary Rainbow Pride Award given by FIU’s Pride Center. This scholarship showed me that I can achieve things that I have always dreamed of, and I am so thankful for SAVE and Freidin Brown’s Support forever”!

Campbell Soup (CPB): Strong performance and value make Campbell Soup a great hedge. Brown-Forman (BF-B): Catalysts are conspiring to make alcoholic beverage makers a winner. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Steady fundamentals and steady growth underpin JNJ’s safety.  Dollar General (DG): This is one of few retailers raising guidance in this environment.  Goldman Sachs (GS): A slant toward the wealthy during hard times favors this bank. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): Supply and demand-side strength underpin ULTA stock. Louis Vuitton (LVMUY): Luxury goods might seem an unlikely choice now, but they’re not.  Safety First painted on a yellow caution strip on dark pavement.

There’s no doubt that investors are quickly shifting for anything safe these days. We can characterize that fear in many ways, but broadly speaking, a strong barometer is the Fear and Greed Index. Its current reading is “extreme fear,” the lowest reading there is. And that should directly correlate to the market assuming a more defensive stance. That means that certain stocks are likely to see increasing investment as portfolios shift in a risk-off period.

And in July this trend is only going to increase as we enter new territory and inflation notches upward as consumption spikes with the 4th of July holiday. That potential spike is just one of many factors affecting the economic outlook. In short, the attractiveness of safe stocks will only rise in July.

7 REITs to Buy for a Bear Market

Let’s take a look at these seven safe stocks to buy in July:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It’s fairly easy to see why a brand like Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) makes sense as a stock to buy in these times. Its brands, especially soups, are synonymous with value. And the company is proving that it can operate well in an inflationary environment marked by significant supply chain constraints.

Story continues

Management was keen to note that it is finding ways to mitigate margin pressure, which is reflected in net sales that increased 7% and continuing operational earnings per share (EPS), which increased 15%.

2022 has already proven to be a very difficult market. It is highly likely that things will get worse before they get better. However, CPB stock has bucked the trend of everything moving downward. In fact, it’s up a few percent on the year. Don’t expect it to rise significantly. Rather, expect it to continue to act as a hedge against the massive inflation we’re enduring and appreciate it for the 3.15% dividend it comes with.

Alcoholic beverage producer Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-B) hasn’t been spared in the downturn in 2022. In fact, year-to-date, it has declined from $71 to $67 at the time of writing. That isn’t particularly bad, especially when compared with broader markets that have dropped more than 20%. And there’s good reason to believe several factors will conspire in its favor in July.

For one, people like to drink alcohol on the 4th of July. Whether that’s one of its whiskey brands, including Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve, or Finlandia vodka, you can safely assume sales will spike.

7 Growth Stocks to Buy for a Rich Retirement

Secondly, consider that Americans have soured on the economy following the recent Federal Reserve rate hike. There’s another rate hike scheduled for July, which Chairman Jerome Powell is telegraphing to be as severe. What this means is that the closer we move to a recession, the more heavily favored spirit consumption becomes.

Safe Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock exudes safety not just for the brands it produces. It is a perennial choice for any investor considering how to mitigate risk within their portfolio. It doesn’t provide investors with much potential for outsized gains, instead providing slow, steady gains.

That is evidenced by the modest EPS beats it has had in each of the last four quarters. They aren’t huge, but they have been consistent.

Take a look at Johnson & Johnson’s price chart over the past three years to see why it is consistently characterized as safe. It only dropped with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which proved to be absolutely unavoidable for all equities. However, it soon regained its steady trajectory and hasn’t budged since, even as the economy reels.

A cursory look at the projected fundamentals of the company throughout the next year indicates more steady revenue and earnings growth, which is exactly what will define safety in this market.

The same point I made above for Johnson & Johnson holds true for Dollar General (NYSE:DG) stock. It has provided consistent, modest EPS beats over the past four quarters.

That’s good news in and of itself. Further, at the same time earnings were released, Dollar General management announced that it was raising fiscal-year forecasts at a time when other retailers were getting crushed. That confidence sends a strong message to investors as DG stock remains flat for the year. In other times, remaining flat is often used to denote weakness. In this case, it doesn’t.

Equally importantly, investors should simply note that Wall Street was expecting Dollar General management to scale back guidance. So, when management told Wall Street it intends not only to meet sales growth of 9.3% this year but to hit 10% to 10.5%, investors should have perked up.

7 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever

Dollar General isn’t ratcheting back guidance. That’s a testament to its pricing strategy. It’s logical to expect that July 4th will provide a boost to sales. Further, expect that as inflation continues to run rampant, sales will rise, as well.

Safe Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs (GS)  Goldman Sachs logo at a PR event. GS stock.

Recommending Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a clear departure from the consumer goods defensive stocks already listed in this article.

The reason is simple, however. UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) recently highlighted the clear opportunity in stocks exposed to the high-end consumer. The fact is that the wealthy are less likely to suffer if and when a recession kicks off.

For one, Goldman Sachs caters to a higher-end clientele than more commercially-minded banks, like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The point here is that Goldman Sachs is likely to see an uptick in business volume as its wealthier clients diversify their assets to take advantage of any recession.

And rising interest rates favor the bank as it can reasonably expect fees to rise as well as revenues as a result.

Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) stock isn’t one that receives a lot of attention, but it should. The products this beauty retailer sells seem to be holding up well in the downturn. Additionally, its operations are clearly strong with a supply chain strategy that suggests it can continue to thrive.

The company’s most recent quarterly results were impressive. The company reported record sales of $2.3 billion. Equally important, its gross profit is rising in a time when many other retailers see their margins declining.

Those impressive results bolstered management confidence enough that it raised fiscal-year 2022 sales guidance from between $9.05 to $9.15 billion to between $9.35 to $9.55 billion.

7 Butchered Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold

Further, the company noted that merchandise inventories increased from $1.35 billion to $1.57 billion year-over-year by the end of the quarter. That suggests that the company shouldn’t have problems with supply-side constraints. Since demand appears strong, Ulta Beauty looks to be in an overall strong position.

Investing in Louis Vuitton (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) stock makes sense given the expansion of the global middle class. I’ve already mentioned that the elite aren’t going to be affected by any recession in the same ways that the rest of us will. If you believe in the notion that the elite will benefit while the rest suffer, LVMUY should pique your interest.

But it isn’t only the 1% who buy Louis Vuitton products, it’s also the expanding global middle class. They want to be seen in Christian Dior or Fendi while wearing Hublot and Bulgari watches and drinking Chandon, as well.

The point here is that July could well kick off a renewed round of recession fears. Rather than making luxury stocks less attractive, it makes them more attractive, according to UBS. Louis Vuitton is a strong company and it doesn’t seem worried about broader issues based on recently announced share buybacks.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:30:03+00:00,HP (HPQ) Down 16.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for HP (HPQ). Shares have lost about 16.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HP due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

HP’s Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates in Q2

HP Inc. delivered better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The personal computer and printer maker’s second-quarter earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a significant year-over-year improvement.

HP reported a solid bottom line for the second quarter, wherein its non-GAAP earnings jumped 16.1% year over year to $1.08 per share from the 93 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 and was in line with the upper end of management’s guided range of $1.02-$1.08.

The significant year-over-year increase in earnings reflected the benefits of higher revenues and favorable pricing, a product mix and currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased investments in innovation and the go-to-market strategy.

HP’s net revenues increased 3.9% year over year to $16.5 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.07 billion. In constant currency (cc), revenues grew 4.9%.

The robust top line reflected the strong demand for HPQ’s personal systems and printers. However, revenues were negatively impacted by continued component supply-chain constraints. Also, pandemic-related factory shutdowns worldwide, along with transportation disruptions and congested ports, negatively impacted HP’s overall sales.

Quarter in Detail

Personal Systems revenues (69.7% of net revenues) came in at $11.5 billion, 9% higher than the year-ago quarter (up 11% in cc). The year-over-year growth reflected the strong demand for PCs and the positive impact of the big shift to mainstream and premium commercials. Further, consumer revenues decreased 6%, while commercial revenues increased 18%.

Story continues

HP’s total PC units sold were down 17% on a year-over-year basis due to expected supply-chain challenges, logistics delays and a lower chrome mix. Notebooks registered a year-over-year decline of 23%, while desktop units increased 11%. Notebook revenues increased 3% year over year to $7.73 billion, while desktop sales grew 28% to $2.86 billion. Workstation sales jumped 21% to $494 million.

HP noted that the demand for its products under the Personal Systems segment remained strong during the reported quarter. The company stated that despite continued supply-chain constraints, it managed to reduce its order backlog sequentially.

HP is witnessing a strong rebound in its Printing business, which was affected by office closures during the pandemic. However, due to continued manufacturing and component supply constraints, HPQ failed to meet demand.

Printing business revenues (30.3% of net revenues) decreased 7% year over year (down 6% in cc) to $5 billion, mainly due to lower hardware units and supplies revenues, partially offset by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in industrial graphics and services.

HP’s total hardware units sold decreased 23%. Consumer Hardware units declined 24%, while revenues plunged 12%. Further, Commercial Hardware units decreased 17%, while revenues decreased 4%. Supplies revenues declined 6%.

Region-wise, at cc, revenues from America (41%), the EMEA (37% of second-quarter revenues) and the APJ (22%) climbed 1%, 7% and 10%, respectively.

Operating Results

Segment-wise, Personal Systems’ operating margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 6.9%, primarily driven by favorable pricing, a product mix and currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased investments in the go-to-market strategy.

The Printing division’s operating margin expanded 140 bps to 19.3% due to favorable pricing and improved performance at industrial graphics and 3D, despite increased commodity and logistics costs.

HP’s overall non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations of 8.8% declined 30 bps year over year on the lower gross margin.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

HP ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 billion, up from $3.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

During the quarter, HPQ generated operating cash flows of $0.5 billion and free cash flow of $0.4 billion. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, the company generated operating cash flows of $2.2 billion.

HP returned $1.3 billion to its shareholders in the form of stock repurchases ($1 billion) and cash dividends ($0.3 billion) in the fiscal second quarter. Also, HP returned 362% of its free cash flows.

Guidance

Buoyed by the strong second-quarter performance, HP raised its fiscal 2022 non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) guidance range to the $4.24-$4.38 range from the $4.18-$4.38 range forecast previously. The company continues to estimate generating at least $4.5 billion in free cash flow during the fiscal year.

On the earnings conference call, HP said that it expects to buy back at least $4 billion worth of its common stock during fiscal 2022.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, HP estimates the non-GAAP EPS between $1.03 and $1.08. HP anticipates solid demand for personal systems, particularly in the commercial product category, in the current quarter and a favorable pricing environment.

However, the company expects that industry-wide component supply constraints might affect its ability to meet demand. Moreover, the ongoing pandemic is expected to cause some manufacturing, port and logistics disruptions, at least throughout fiscal 2022. These factors are expected to curb the company’s revenues in the ongoing quarter.

For the printing segment, HP projects robust demand for consumer printers and a continued improvement in the commercial segment as offices reopen. However, it projects the division’s performance in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter due to continued component shortages and logistics delays.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

It turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.

VGM Scores

Currently, HP has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

HP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

Salesforce Beats Q1 Earnings, Guidance Raise

Salesforce delivered better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The company’s first-quarter non-GAAP earnings of 98 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Quarterly earnings included a benefit of a penny per share from the mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. However, non-GAAP earnings declined 19% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.21 per share.

Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $7.41 billion climbed 24% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.37 billion. The top line also improved 26% in constant currency (cc).

The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal first quarter. Also, the recently acquired Slack business boosted revenues and contributed $348 million to total sales in the first quarter.

Quarter in Detail

Coming to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of total revenues) increased 24% from the year-earlier period to $5.54 billion. Professional Services and Other (7% of total sales) revenues climbed 30% to $555 million.

Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $1.31 billion, up 8% year over year. However, the non-GAAP operating margin contracted 260 bps to 17.6% due to the lower gross margin and increased operating expenses. Operating expenses flared up 32% year over year to $5.35 billion.

Salesforce exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $13.5 billion compared with the $10.5 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. CRM generated operating cash flow of $3.68 billion and free cash flow of $3.5 billion in the first quarter.

For fiscal 2023, the company increased its non-GAAP earnings guidance range to the $4.74-$4.76 per share range from the $4.62-$4.64 band projected earlier. It now anticipates the non-GAAP operating margin for the fiscal year of approximately 20.4% instead of around 20%. The company reiterated its year-over-year operating cash flow growth guidance of 21-22%.

However, CRM lowered its revenue guidance range to the $31.7-$31.8 billion range from the $32-$32.1 billion band due to forex headwinds. The company forecast that the stronger U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a $600-million negative impact on total revenues. The updated guidance includes expected revenues from the newly acquired Slack business of $1.5 billion.

On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call, Salesforce anticipated that the Traction on Demand business acquisition would contribute approximately $75 million to its fiscal 2023 total revenues.

For the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $7.69 billion and $7.70 billion. The revenue guidance includes a $200-million negative impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $1.01-$1.02 for the current quarter.

Companies in loyalty management are investing in analytics and business intelligence tools for a targeted customer approach. Collecting engagement data throughout a company’s clients' buying journeys can help the company gain a better understanding of how they behave and how to communicate with them most effectively. For instance, in May 2021, US-based software company, Salesforce, introduced new CDP (Customer Data Platform) improvements to guarantee that customer data becomes smarter and more linked, making it simpler for businesses to act on it in a more trustworthy manner. CDPs guarantee that all addressable channels have access to a uniform profile and that personalization and relevance are implemented.

""Our latest fee changes mark another significant milestone for BMO in our journey to empower customers to achieve their financial goals and to make real financial progress,"" said Paul Dilda, head of consumer strategy for BMO Harris Bank. ""Given the current economic climate, we know it is more important than ever to help our consumer and small business customers work toward their financial goals.""

In November 2021, BMO reduced the number of overdraft or NSF charges a customer may incur to three per day. The bank also eliminated consecutive day overdraft fees for accounts that remain overdrawn for an extended period.

BMO's Real Financial Progress Index, which measures Americans' sentiment around financial confidence, recently found that inflation and rising consumer costs are affecting Americans' behaviors, with 80% of Americans surveyed planning to change their everyday actions to offset the impact and save money. The changes being announced today will help alleviate some of the financial stress currently being felt by consumers and small businesses across the country.

(NASDAQ: VGFC) (TSXV: VERY.V) (FSE: OSI) (""VERY GOOD"" or the ""Company""), today filed a resale registration statement on Form F-1 (the ""Resale Registration Statement"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") pursuant to which the selling securityholder named in the Resale Registration Statement may, from time to time, offer and sell the securities covered by the Resale Registration Statement. The Resale Registration Statement has not become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.

In addition, the Company today also filed its restated condensed consolidated interim financial statements and restated management's discussion and analysis for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022.  Due to the level of employee turnover and vacancies within the Company's accounting department, coupled with a shortened prescribed time for the Company to report its quarterly results and for management to prepare the first quarter financial statements, the Company's external auditors were unable to complete a review of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 before the filing deadline of May 16, 2022. As a result, the Company filed its first quarter financial statements with a note indicating that such financial statements had not yet been reviewed by the Company's external auditor. In connection with the filing of the Resale Registration Statement, as at June 29, 2022, the Company's external auditor completed its review of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 resulting in the Company amending and restating the previously filed condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the period ended March 31, 2022.

The Company has restated the general and administrative expense for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 in the amount of $1,211,000 to increase such expense from $3,633,691 to $4,844,691.  The adjustment related to the correction of an error in the determination of the share-based compensation recovery for the period which reduced the share-based compensation recovery from $2,003,852 to $792,852.  As a result of such restatement net loss and comprehensive loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 increased from $8,362,309 and $8,315,787 to $9,573,309 and $9,526,787 respectively.  The loss per share for the period increased from $0.07 per common share to $0.08 per common share as a result of the restatement. Corresponding changes were made to increase amount of the equity reserve and deficit balances by $1,211,000 in the statements of financial position and changes in equity and to the net loss for the period and share-based compensation (recovery) in the statement of cash flows.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:29:52+00:00,"Inflation: Consumers 'are noticeably getting hit' despite savings cushion, economist says","PGIM Fixed Income Lead Economist Ellen Gaske joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss inflation, consumer spending, recessionary risks, and the state of the economy.

Video Transcript

- Let's get back to that inflation read that Brian was pointing to, and bring in PGIM fixed income lead economist, Ellen Gaske. Ellen, it's good to talk to you today. Let me just first get your read on this. We were talking about it earlier. Have we reached the peak? How do we read the data we got today?

ELLEN GASKE: Right. So we've been seeing a notable slowdown in economic activity this year, a broad based slowdown. GDP estimates for this year keep coming down. The consumer emerged from COVID crisis in great shape. We had expected spending to begin to moderate after the peak during the reopenings, but this year actually the consumer has turned out to be weaker than anticipated.

First quarter, the consumer spending pace was revised lower, from 3% down to 1.8%. So above trend to something a little bit below trend. And now so far in the second quarter, consumer spending has been even weaker. Last month declining more than expected.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Ellen, it's Brian Cheung here. I wanted to ask, I guess just on the other side of things, on saving. We actually saw the personal saving rate increase to 5.4%. It's still historically low, and we know that the levels of savings remain high because of the stimulus that was kind of put in place there. But when you see a tick up in the saving rate, does that tell you anything about in tandem with the fact that spending is going down, that Americans are starting to pull back, which could be a positive sign for getting inflation down?

ELLEN GASKE: Yes. I would agree with that. The silver lining of the downward revisions to consumption was that the savings rate actually was revised up by about a percentage point or so. But pre-COVID it had been running 7% to 8%. And, as you said, it's dropped now to 5.4%.

It hasn't dropped to the lows we saw back during the housing boom-- 2% savings rate-- so there is a bit of a cushion there for consumers to stomach, to weather this high inflation. But with the Fed hiking rates, they do mean to dampen that consumption pace. They do mean to tilt the balance towards more savings rather than consuming.

Story continues

The cost of financing autos, the cost of buying a home, all of that, the interest rate increases significantly, increasing those costs. At the same time, savings offering perhaps a better avenue. So the Fed does mean to tilt that balance. The savings rate does provide a bit more of a cushion, but consumers aren't noticeably getting hit by the high inflation.

Their wages aren't keeping pace. They have been able to keep up nominal spending. But it's coming out showing up in very weak real spending growth.

- So Ellen, what does that say in terms of how the Fed weighs this along with the broader picture you just pointed to, the consumer not getting hit as much? Yesterday we were talking about what we heard from Jay Powell. The markets sort of interpreting that to say, well, maybe the Fed can't move as aggressively as it wanted to, given the dynamics at play.

ELLEN GASKE: So that's been my base case over the last year. That the Fed wouldn't, in fact, be able to hike as much as the Fed's been projecting, and certainly what the market's been expecting. The market pricing has come off a bit in recent weeks.

It's in line with the Fed, expecting that the Fed will indeed hike the funds rate to 3.4% by the end of this year. That's double its current level. But then the Fed has a couple of more hikes penciled in for next year. The markets aren't buying that any more. The markets have it peaking at 3.4%. And, in fact, the Fed likely cutting by next year.

We saw pre-COVID that a Fed funds rate at about 1.75%, which is where it stands right now, that seemed to be about what the economy could sustainably absorb. So my own view is that any further hikes from here is a hike into restrictive territory. We've seen interest sensitive sectors really respond to the higher rates. Housing has unwound the surge. We saw it during the two years of COVID.

Auto sales are depressed, durable goods spending is moderating. We're seeing a reaction of the economy. With a lag, I'm expecting prices to follow suit. We are seeing some softening of some pockets of price pressures softening. And I expect it will have an impact.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Yeah. And perhaps the doubt in the markets is the reason why we've seen the 10 year actually falling actually about 300 basis points right now.

AKRON, Ohio, June 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With the Fourth of July fast approaching and the summer months upon us, FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) is reminding the public to be cautious of potential electrical hazards associated with popular outdoor activities. Celebrating responsibly will help keep customers safe and the electricity flowing reliably this season. FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)

""As we prepare for parades, barbeques and outdoor fun, we encourage everyone to keep electrical safety top of mind to ensure a safe holiday and summer season,"" said Chad Stoneking, director of Safety Operations at FirstEnergy. ""Enjoying the season responsibly can also help prevent unnecessary disruptions to your electric service during a time when many people rely on their air conditioning to stay cool and comfortable.""

Foil balloons and fireworks are two of the most common and festive ways to celebrate Independence Day. However, they can create safety issues and cause major damage to the electric system when they are used near power lines and electrical equipment.

While foil balloons have increased in popularity as holiday and party decorations, they continue to cause many power outages because their metallic coating conducts electricity when they drift into power lines or electrical equipment. February typically marks the onset of a dramatic increase in outages caused by adrift metallic balloons that peaks in June or July, when warm weather takes celebrations and picnics outdoors. Over recent months, foil balloons were to blame for nearly 60 power outages across FirstEnergy's six-state service area.

Customers should securely tie helium-filled foil balloons to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from floating away, and then puncture and deflate them once they are no longer in use because they can stay inflated for several weeks. Never release them into the sky.

FirstEnergy also encourages customers to leave the large, colorful fireworks displays to the professionals. Extra caution should be used when handling fireworks, firecrackers and rockets at home, and they should only be lit in open areas where no power lines are in sight. Should a firework accidentally come in contact with a power line or equipment, leave it alone and immediately call 911 to report the problem.

Story continues

To help ensure holidays and celebrations are enjoyed responsibly, customers should keep the following outdoor safety tips in mind:

Never fly kites, motorized airplanes or drones near power lines. While kites almost always use cotton string, wet cotton string can conduct electricity as well as metal string. Never attempt to retrieve any type of object that gets caught in a power line or drifts or crashes into a substation. Leave it alone and immediately call FirstEnergy at 888-544-4877 to report the problem. Keep electrical devices and cords at least 10-feet away from water sources such as pools and spas. When possible, use battery-operated electrical devices outside. All outdoor receptacles should be covered to keep them dry. This is especially important around pools, spas and other summer water activities. When hauling a boat, make sure it clears overhead power lines and stay away from power lines when sailing. Never climb a tree that is growing near or into overhead lines or near a utility pole. Also, never climb utility poles or other infrastructure, in particular transmission towers or substation fences. These activities are extremely hazardous and can result in very severe injuries. Stay far away from a downed or low-hanging power line. Always assume any downed wires are energized and dangerous. Report them ASAP by calling 911.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:28:40+00:00,Gold Price Forecast – Gold Markets Continue to Threaten $1800,"Gold Market Technical Analysis

Gold markets have gone back and forth during the trading session on Thursday, as we have seen more volatility in the marketplace. That being said, the $1800 level is an area that is extreme support and is very important to the uptrend. Not only is it a large, round, psychologically significant figure, but it is also an uptrend line that you need to pay close attention to.

Beyond that, we are starting to see the 50 Day EMA ready to cross below the 200 Day EMA, forming the so-called “death cross.” That is of course a bearish indicator, albeit one that is typically late. That could lead to more selling, but if we break down below this uptrend line, I think gold is in serious trouble.

Pay close attention to the bond yields in America, because they have something to say as well, after all the rising yields work against the value of gold as it is cheaper to hold paper than it is to store bullion. Ultimately, I think this continues to be a “fade the rally” type of market, but I think also that the market will eventually carve out some type of bottom. Longer-term, I do like gold but it may have one more flush lower before we can find enough value hunters to come in and pick the whole thing out.

That being said, the Federal Reserve changes its tune and starts to show cracks in its desire to raise interest rates, gold will be the first place that I will start looking to deploy my trading capital.

The company recently reported third-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS of $3.76 that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.2% and increased 38.2% year over year. FactSet’s revenues of $488.8 million in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.7% and increased 22.3% year over year.

How is FactSet Doing?

FactSet’s growing customer base, high client retention rate (92%) and solid revenue growth should positively impact results over the long term. In third-quarter fiscal 2022, organic revenues increased 10.5% year over year to $441.7 million. Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services were $1.94 billion, up 19.8% year over year. The company added 147 clients in the quarter, taking the total number to 7,319.

The recent buyout of CUSIP Global Services from S&P Global SPGI is expected to significantly boost FactSet’s open data strategy and expand its position in the global capital markets.

FactSet has a consistent track record of rewarding its shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. The company repurchased shares worth $264.7 million, $199.6 million and $220.4 million, and paid $117.9 million, $110.4 million and $100.1 million in dividends in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.

FactSet’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2022 stood at 2.00, lower than the current ratio of 3.72 reported at the end of fiscal second quarter and the prior-year quarter’s 3.28. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.

ABM’s Tailwinds

ABM’s multi-year comprehensive strategic plan, ELEVATE, focuses on providing clients with offerings that enhance transparency and efficiencies, developing its own talent management system capabilities, expanding data usage and modernizing the digital ecosystem. ELEVATE is expected to significantly accelerate the company’s organic growth, improve its strategic and comprehensive positioning, and reinforce profitability.

The recent acquisition of Dublin-based janitorial services company — Momentum Support — is expected to strengthen ABM’s foothold in fast-growing markets in Ireland like technology and life sciences. The buyout provides ABM access to Momentum’s blue-chip customer base and positions it to cross sell ABM services to existing ABM clients who also have presence in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

ABM focuses on rewarding its shareholders through dividends. The company paid $51 million, $49.3 million and $47.7 million in dividends in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.

Some Risks

ABM Industries' current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of the January quarter was pegged at 1.17, lower than the current ratio of 1.45 reported at the end of the prior-year quarter. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:28:00+00:00,Fraud and Security in Global Online Payments 2022,"New York, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Fraud and Security in Global Online Payments 2022"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05794538/?utm_source=GNW

As the use of mobile phones for online activities such as purchases, payments, or banking increased, fraudsters began to target these devices as well. In particular, the share of fraudulent digital banking transactions globally conducted via mobile apps grew steadily over the last couple of years; the overall share of fraud committed via mobile devices was estimated to be more than 50% in the second quarter of 2021. In China, the most common mobile payment security problem in 2020 was personal information leakage. In France, nearly 80% of adults fear becoming victims of online mobile payment fraud, according to an October 2021 survey.

B2C E-Commerce losses from digital payment fraud worldwide were expected to exceed 20 billion US dollars in 2021

While E-Commerce is growing tremendously worldwide, fraud is also on the rise, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This is because consumers around the world are switching heavily to online shopping. Thus, between 2020 and 2021, B2C E-Commerce losses from online payment fraud globally were expected to increase by 18% from the previous year and exceed 20 billion US dollars in 2021. Moreover, large-scale fraud activity was observed in the European region, namely, in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). For example, more than 90% of online stores experienced frauds or fraud attempts in the last 12 months, as of March 2021.

""Security” was the most critical factor that consumers around the world considered when online in 2021

Consumer behavior and preferences around the world have changed dramatically over the past couple of years, and that change includes security. For example, more than 80% of consumers around the world consider ""security"" to be an important factor in their online experience, according to a September 2021 survey. In Japan, “security” was the 2nd top factor needed for entirely cashless payments, chosen by over a third of surveyed Japanese respondents in August 2021. Thus, consumers are increasingly choosing to protect their experience through authentication, such as using facial recognition when making online payments, which is projected to grow at about 16% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 globally.

AAPL,2022-06-30T15:27:00+00:00,"SCHW EQUITY ALERT: ROSEN, A TOP RANKED LAW FIRM, Encourages The Charles Schwab Corporation Investors with Losses to Inquire About Securities Class Action Investigation – SCHW","NEW YORK, June  30, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces an investigation of potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) resulting from allegations that Charles Schwab may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Charles Schwab securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=6945 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On July 1, 2021, Charles Schwab disclosed that the Company had been “responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arising from a compliance examination.” The investigation primarily concerned “historic disclosures related to the Schwab Intelligent Portfolios® (SIP) digital advisory solution.” Charles Schwab further disclosed its “second quarter 2021 financial results will include a liability and related non-deductible charge of $200 million.”

On this news, Charles Schwab share prices dropped $0.77, or approximately 1%, to close at $72.80 on July 2, 2021.

On June 13, 2022, the SEC announced that it “charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries” who “agreed to pay $187 million to harmed clients to settle the charges.” The SEC charged Charles Schwab with misleading investors that used its robo-adviser product, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. Instead of the touted “disciplined portfolio construction methodology” that sought “optimal return[s]”, Charles Schwab’s “own data showed that under most market conditions, the cash in the portfolios would cause clients to make less money even while taking on the same amount of risk.”

On this news, Charles Schwab share prices dropped $1.98, or approximately 3%, to close on June 13, 2022 at $60.24.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
