Matthew Field reports:\\n\\nGraphcore, which is headquartered in Bristol, designs semiconductors tailored for AI software, in an effort to compete with $1 trillion (£800bn) US tech giant Nvidia. It had been targeting expansion into China.\\n\\nHowever, recent changes to US export controls have hamstrung those efforts as the White House imposes restrictions on exports of advanced processors that can be used to power AI tools. Non-US companies have been caught by the restrictions as many use American-made software and equipment.\\n\\nA Graphcore spokesman said: “The recently updated US export controls mean that Graphcore - in common with other AI hardware manufacturers - is no longer able to sell IPU systems in China. Regrettably, this means we will be significantly scaling back business operations in China.”\\n\\nGraphcore has raised more than $700m in funding from investors including Baillie Gifford, Samsung and Microsoft to bring its “intelligence processing unit” - or IPU - chip to market.\\n\\nWhile shares in Nvidia, which dominates the market for AI chips, have skyrocketed this year, up 240pc, privately-held Graphcore has faced cuts to its valuation by shareholders.\\n\\nIn April, it emerged that Sequoia, one of its biggest backers, had written off its stake to zero. In its results this week, London-listed investor Molton Ventures trimmed the value of its holding in Graphcore from £37.2m to £21.3m, down 42pc. At one stage, Molton had valued its holding at £113.5m.\\n\\nGraphcore has urged the British Government to buy its technology as part of efforts to expand the UK’s capacity of AI-capable supercomputing power.

Matthew Field reports:\\n\\nThe smartphone market grew by 5pc in October, according to data from Counterpoint Research, after contracting for 27 months in a row, driven by sales in China and emerging markets.\\n\\nPhone sales have tumbled amid a lack of must-have new innovations, while phones are lasting for longer, with consumers holding on to a typical handset for more than three years. The second-hand and refurbished phone market has also been growing.\\n\\nThe £500bn global smartphone market can be seen as an economic bellwether, providing an indication of how much disposable income people have to invest in new gadgets.\\n\\nThe growth spurt came after Apple launched sales of the iPhone 15 on Sept 22, with a faster processor and updated charging technology.\\n\\nCounterpoint Research cited a “comeback” by Huawei, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer, as well as rising sales in India.\\n\\nIn September, Huawei launched a new phone powered by advanced microchips, developed apparently in spite of US sanctions on the Chinese technology giant.\\n\\nThe sales boost came after smartphone sales fell to their lowest point in a decade, driven by an economic slowdown in China and saturation in the rest of the world.

And if we are privileged enough to come into power, I don’t underestimate the challenges that we will face because of the 13 years of failure that we’ve already had.\\n\\nThat will require tough choices. But we have already said where we will increase tax, the non-dom status will be abolished, that money will be used directly for our health service.\\n\\nWe’ve said exactly what we’ll put into our schools. But the underlying answer has to be about economic growth. And if you’re going to have economic growth, you need a realisable plan that’s worked with business to make it actually work.\\n\\nThe Government says it wants growth, but just look at the forecast they’ve got after 13 years of near negligible growth, they’ve now got a forecast that it’s not going to grow very much in the future.

Now more than two thirds do.”\\n\\nThe difference is partly driven by Rishi Sunak’s decision to increase national Insurance (NI) thresholds for employees, and for the self-employed in 2022 to ease the burden on workers even as millions have been dragged into higher tax bands. Pensioners do not pay national insurance.\\n\\nHowever, Mr Johnson described the levelling of incomes enjoyed by workers and pensions as an “unequivocally a good thing”.\\n\\nHe said: “In 2010 the employee would have paid about £2,750 more than the pensioner, they will now pay £1,250 more.”\\n\\n10:50 AM GMT\\n\\nGovernment to meet fiscal rule based on 'plain implausible assumptions', says IFS\\n\\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the “substantial tax cuts” in the Autumn Statement are being “paid for by planned real cuts in public service spending”.\\n\\nIn a post-statement briefing, Mr Johnson said the Chancellor is “by the narrowest of tiny margins still on course to meet his - poorly designed - fiscal rule that debt as a fraction of national income should be falling in the last year of the forecast period”.\\n\\nHe continued:\\n\\nThat is on the basis of a series of questionable, if not plain implausible, assumptions.\\n\\nIt assumes that many aspects of day-to-day public service spending will be cut.

Debt is not declining over time. Taxes are still heading to record levels.\\n\\nSpending is also due to stay high by historic standards, not least because of high debt interest payments.\\n\\nBut those payments plus pressures on health and pension spending mean current plans are for some pretty serious cuts across other areas of public spending.\\n\\nHow did Mr Hunt afford tax cuts when real economic forecasts got no better?

The fast growth in new product sales did not adversely impact our business. Importantly, second-hand industry continues to thrive with more people choosing to trade in and buy high-quality premium products for new lifestyles.\\r\\nWith efficient organization, a dedicated team, and industry-leading automation technology capabilities, we are confident in offering in the new era as a leader in the second-hand industry. In the quarter, our total revenues reached RMB3.26 billion, representing a 28.4% year-over-year increase, surpassing our guidance. Total revenues for the first three quarters amounted to RMB9.1 billion, marking a 32% year-over-year increase and exceeding our initial expectations at the beginning of the year.\\r\\nDuring the festive fourth quarter, bolstered by JD.com support and our inclusion in Apple's official trading program, the outlook for our overall revenue growth in 2023 is increasingly clear. During the quarter, adjusted operating income reached RMB73.8 million with an adjusted operating margin of 2.3%, setting a new record and further confirming our ability to improve operational efficiency through automation technology and economies of scale. Adjusted operating margin for nine months ended September 30 was 1.9% ahead of our schedule.\\r\\nOur quarterly results surpassed expectations. This was primarily attributable to the growing scale of the recycling and resale business, which consistently drives industry expansion. Within this context, the development of our 1P business remains our core strategic focus, serving as a primary driver of our growth. At the same time, enhancing the service capabilities of our 3P platform business to encourage long-term merchant engagement serves as important supplementary driver.\\r\\nDuring the third quarter, our 1P business revenue grew by 31.4% year over year to RMB2.92 billion. Within our core C2B business, we leveraged our existing network of nearly 2,000 national-wide offline stores and upgraded some into premier stores. These stores are designed to raise user awareness of multi-category recycling and AHS Recycle as a national brand.\\r\\nAlongside a competitive cause we offer to users, our convenient and reliable services have attracted a larger customer base and secured a greater supply of premium products, which further increases store performance while reducing costs.\\r\\nI'd like to share two noteworthy highlights resulting from this strategic upgrade. First, in the aspect of working revenue as a percentage of core C2B revenues. There has been of 6% year-over-year increase during the quarter, underscoring the increasing strength of our AHS brand and its impact on consumers. Second, during October, the monthly recycling values in Beijing and Shanghai both exceeded RMB100 million. We believe that as more AHS Recycle stores are equipped with multi-category recycling capabilities, the selling of our C2B business in higher tier cities will be further raised.\\r\\nStarting in July this year, our B2C retail brand, Paipai Selection, was integrated into the AHS main brand, which was renamed AHS Selection. This strategic initiative is intended to provide enhanced services for our retail users and bolster the quality and trustworthiness of the AHS Recycle brand. This brand upgrade further solidifies our second-hand retail value chain from B2B to B2C by complementing the closed loop with direct-to-consumer sales capabilities.\\r\\nIn terms of compliance refurbishment, in the third quarter, the compliance refurbish business contributed a total of RMB200 million in revenue, adding greater value to more models of pre-owned electronic products. Since the end of July, we have been authorized to recondition Huawei products while exploring the refurbishment capabilities of multiple Android products. With controllable costs, we could gain a margin of gross profit of 4% to 5%, and consumers will further benefit from a greater variety of refurbished products.\\r\\nIn terms of industry standards, in the third quarter as the main sponsor, we jointly drafted the second-hand mobile phone transaction group standard with Shenzhen Electronics Industry Association. At the same time in collaboration with the association, the China's second-hand electronic trading center was jointly established to promote online and offline integration and to promote healthy development of second-hand transactions.\\r\\nTurning to our services embedded in Apple's official channels, our recycling business has been rapidly integrated into Apple's retail network in China, providing recycling and trading services on Apple's official website and in its offline flagship stores. During November this year, we obtain a qualification that allows us to recycle the two most recent generations of iPhone lineup. Specifically, while a user trades in an iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 for a new iPhone 15 lineup product through Apple's official website and storefronts, their used devices go to AHS Recycle for further handling. This presents a significant recognition of our supply chain capabilities.\\r\\nIn terms of our marketplaces, we are continuously improving our service capabilities. During the quarter, [thrifting] revenue increased by 7.3% year over year to RMB330 million with an overall take rate of 5.4%. Regarding our PJT Marketplace, we have improved our services for merchants and equipped them with the Device Hero, our portfolio quality inspection terminal. The proprietary features embedded significantly enhanced their purchasing and shipping management capabilities. The device also leads to the burden of real-time inventory management and business analysis, reducing time and labor costs while realizing faster turnover.\\r\\nPJT Marketplace has become an infrastructure of B2B transactions. By the end of the third quarter, PJT had amassed over 530,000 registered users, while the number of active users increased by 15.4% year over year during the period.\\r\\nOur Paipai Marketplace continues to allow us to meet broader consumer demand for cost efficient, high-quality pre-owned products. We supported JD's low-price retail strategy by enhancing our retail price system through adjustments to product grade ranges to align with users' preferences for more affordable goods.\\r\\nDuring the quarter, we upgraded Paipai B2C consignment business model on JD's main site. It further open up the platform to small and medium-sized merchants to join, provide supplies, and operate on JD.com. Our platform ensures quality with a unified quality system. Such an innovative model substantially reduces the entry barriers for small retail businesses in the industry, providing them with ample and easy access to platform resources while ensuring product quality and buyer satisfaction.\\r\\nTurning to our expenses. Firstly, we continue to lower the non-GAAP fulfillment expense ratio to 8.7% by 2 percentage points year on year. This was primarily due to an 11% year-over-year decrease in logistics expenses, thanks to our updated national operation station footprint. Return losses from testing errors saw a 20.5% year-over-year reduction, thanks to the technological and efficiency advantages provided by our automated operation centers, especially the Matrix 3.0 system.\\r\\nSecondly, we obtain optimization in ROI for selling and marketing expenses. During the third quarter, adjusted selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were 7%, representing a year-over-year decrease of 2.8 percentage points. The strength of our brand name played a key role as we had a higher percentage of 1P recycling channels that required a fewer selling expenses. We also streamlined our regional sales teams and increased our sales output.\\r\\nGoing on our robust growth in consumer electronics categories, we actively diversify our multicategory recycling business and explore marketing opportunities through new media. The recycling volume of our multicategory business amounted to RMB350 million in the third quarter. This is a testament to the rapid growth over the past quarters. Non-consumer electronics recycling services have gained wide popularity among the AHS user community.\\r\\nExperience is the most important part of our flywheel. We shortened the waiting time for in-store pricing of luxury goods recycling, further enhancing user experience. User satisfaction with the quotation was improved and payments were made even faster. Through trust and service experience advantages of in-store face-to-face fulfillment, we are able to break the glass ceiling while uplifting service frequency and UE of our stores.\\r\\nFurthermore, as part of our internal marketing resource allocation and to support a multicategory recycling business, we test the water of traffic generation from new media. We have already (technical difficulty) local accounts for our offline stores on short video platforms where we create cost effective localized content that showcases user experiences while exploring our stores and utilizing doorsteps recycling. By leveraging location algorithms, we attract a higher number of local users to our stores. Since the content is developed in-house, we didn't have any significant expenses.\\r\\nIn summary, this result came from our steadfast strategy of occupying precise things, consolidating supply chain capabilities, and underlying driven business. The results also verify the second-hand industry's substantial potential for scale and enduring value. I would like to thank our united and hardworking team again for their tireless efforts.\\r\\nFinally, I would like to provide an update on our sustainability efforts. In September 2023 as a Chinese company found the pre-owned consumer electronics industry, we are honored to become the first signatory to join the United Nations Global Compact. We are committed to upholding the 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. This commitment strengthens the foundation for our company's sustainable development and aligns with our long-term mission.\\r\\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Rex, for financial updates.\\n\\nRex Chen\\n\\nThank you. Hello, everyone. We are pleased to report another profitable quarter as we achieved yet another new record in the GAAP operating income on revenues that exceeded the top end of our guidance. Before going into our financial details, please note that all amounts are in RMB, and our comparisons are year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated.\\r\\nIn the third quarter, total revenues increased by 28.4% to RMB3,256.8 million, mainly driven by growth in net product revenues. Net product revenues increased by 31.4% to RMB2,924 million, while net service revenues increased by 7.3% to RMB332.8 million. Gross in net product revenue was primary driven by an increase in sales of pre-owned consumer electronics both stores or company's online and offline channels. Sales of 1P refurbished devices totaled [RMB2 billion], more than doubled compared with the same period last year.\\r\\nThe increase in service revenues was primarily due to the recovery of pipeline and the PJT Marketplaces from the COVID-19 pandemic influence during 2022. And an increase in the overall take rate, which grew to 5.4% from [4.45%].\\r\\nTurning to our operating expenses. To provide greater clarity on the trends in our actual operating-based expenses, we will also discuss our non-GAAP operating expenses, which better reflect how management views our results of operations. The reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and the corresponding Form 6-K finished with the SEC.\\r\\nMerchandise costs increased by 35.1% to RMB2,611 million. The increase was in line with the growth in product sales revenues. Gross margin at the group level was 19.8% in third quarter. Gross margin for our 1P business was 10.7%. Fulfillment expenses increased by 3.8% to RMB287.7 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses which we will refer to as SBC from here.\\r\\nNon-GAAP fulfillment expenses increased by 4.2% to RMB282.3 million under the GAAP measures. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs as the company's recycling activities developed compared with the same period of 2022. Non-GAAP fulfillment expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 8.7% from 10.7% in the same period last year.\\r\\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased by 12.1% to RMB299.5 million. Excluding SBC expenses and amortization of intangible assets, non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses decreased by 8.7% to RMB227.9 million, primarily due to a decrease in expenses in relation to marketing activities. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 7% from 9.8% in the same period last year.\\r\\nG&A expenses increased by 9.7% to RMB69.8 million. Excluding SBC expenses, non-GAAP G&A expenses increased by 9.3% to RMB50.6 million. Non-GAAP G&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.6% from 1.8% in the same period last year.\\r\\nTechnology and content expenses decreased by 21.4% to RMB39.4 million. Excluding SBC expenses and amortization of intangible assets, non-GAAP technology and content expenses decreased by 23.2% to RMB33.7 million. This was primarily due to the decrease in technological expenses as the company's platforms matured. Non-GAAP technology and content expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1% from 1.7% in the same period last year.\\r\\nAs a result, our non-GAAP operating income was RMB73.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 2.3%, marks a new record high. The non-GAAP operating margin was 0.4% in the same period last year.\\r\\nAs of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and the funds receivable from third-party payment service providers totaled RMB2.3 billion. Our sufficient cash on hand safeguards a sustainable growth outlook.\\r\\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we repurchased 1.6 million ADSs in the open market for total cash consideration of USD4 million. As of September 30, 2023, we have repurchased a total of 13.8 million ADSs for approximately USD48.4 million in our share repurchase programs.\\r\\nNow turning to the business outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the company currently expects its total revenues to be between RMB3,730 million and RMB3,830 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 25.1% to 28.5%. This forecast only reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions which are subject to change.\\r\\nThis concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\\n\\nQuestion and Answer Session\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) Victor Tang, Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nVictor Tang\\n\\n(interpreted) Thank you for taking my question. I'm asking this question on behalf of our analyst, (inaudible). Can management share some color on to achieve single state grant promotion performance and what does management take on the outlook for 2024? Can management also provide an update on operations' inclusion in Apple's official channel in Mainland China and while the region's revival of Huawei cellphone impact your recycling performance. Thank you, management.\\n\\nXuefeng Chen\\n\\n(interpreted) Thank you, Victor, for your question. Throughout this year's Double Eleven, we observed a certain user enthusiasm for recycling in trading. During the pre-sale period after grand promotion, the total value of C2B recycling orders increased significantly by 60% year on year. Both Shanghai and Beijing also reached the RMB100 million milestone in single-month transaction values in October. And our B2C sales on November 11 across all channels totaled RMB160 million, representing an increase of 24% year on year.\\r\\nOur recycling business performance speaks volumes about user loyalty towards the AHS Recycle brand and scoring the resilience and immense growth potential of our business model within the circular economy. As we approach the end of November, our guidance for total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 ranges from RMB3,730 million to RMB3,830 million, reflecting 25.1% to 28.5% year-over-year growth.\\r\\nLooking ahead to fiscal year 2024, we remain confident in the promising evolution trends of the circular economy and our business strategies. We are confident in executing our strategy to realize higher profitability from our compliance refurbishment business, our involvement in Apple's official recycling and training programs, expansion of our multicategory recycling, and the efficiency enhancements from automation technologies.\\r\\nIPhone remains a key brand for our premium consumer electronics recycling business, accounting for 60% share of 1P recycling business revenues. IPhone sales in Mainland China continued to be robust, reflecting Apple's sustained popularity among consumers. The number of Apple products in circulation is huge and the value retention rate is still industry leading. There is room to further increase the penetration rate of trading services.\\r\\nOur services for Apple's official website and flagship stores in Mainland China began in the third quarter, generating RMB13 million in sales despite limited new phone shipments and training others during the period. In the fourth quarter, we secured qualifications that allow us to recycle the two most recent generations of iPhones, which means we can have iPhone 13 lineup and 14 lineup for the new iPhone 15 lineup. This allows us to significantly scale up the amount of recycling mainstream products.\\r\\nThank you for the question.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nJing Chen, CICC.\\n\\nJing Chen\\n\\n(interpreted) Thanks, management, for taking my question. Could management talk about the use of cash and how you are handling the shares repurchase? Thank you.\\n\\nRex Chen\\n\\nThank you for the question. As of September 30, 2023, our total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and funds receivable from third-party equipment service providers summed to RMB2.3 billion, to support our long-term strategy and business development.\\r\\nSo first for the maintenance of pre-owned consumer electronics, we will continue to strengthen the control of the use of cash, improve the operating cash flow, and increase the positive cash inflow from core mature business. Second, we will deploy cash in a disciplined manner into areas with long-term potential, especially multicategory business based on existing AHS Recycle stores.\\r\\nWe believe that the enhanced operational cash flow and a prudent capital expenditure will be conducive to the further strengthening of the company's competitive advantages and long-term value to shareholders. We have been continuously repurchasing our shares since late 2021 through the share repurchase programs we adopted. Repurchased stocks are booked as [current] stock, which are devoid of rights to dividends or voting.\\r\\nBy the end of third quarter 2023, a total of USD48.4 million had been expended through the share repurchase program since December 2021. We plan to continue to conduct stock repurchase in the foreseeable future.\\r\\nThank you for your question.\\n\\nJing Chen\\n\\nThere is another question from [Dwight Chu] of Bank of America. But due to technological issues, I'll read out her question on behalf of her.\\r\\n(interpreted) Congrats on another strong quarter. My first question is about margins. Can management share more color on profit margin and your non-GAAP OP margin? What's the outlook for your margins? My second question is on refurbishment. Can management comment on the progress and the expectations of the compliance refurbishment business? Thank you.\\n\\nRex Chen\\n\\nOkay. Thank you for the question. So in the third quarter of 2023, so gross profit margin was 19.8%, which was a year-over-year decline due to our strategic shift in revenue mix. Over the past five quarters, we have focused on bolstering our [winter] businesses. And as such, the 3P service revenues, which involves several costs, contributed 10.2% to our total revenues, downsizing by 2% year over year.\\r\\nSo taking a detailed view of the gross profit of the 1P business. The third quarter gross profit margin stood at 10.7%. This aligned with our expectations that1P gross profit margin would contract in this quarter. So two reasons behind this. First, during the new phone sales season in September, we proactively adjusted our sales price of refurbish services in preparation for seasonal margin fluctuation. We also adjusted the business products selling prices. Such adjustments aims to meet the demand of merchants by reducing their procurement costs and ensuring their profitability.\\r\\nSecond, to supplement our supply. We procured second-hand devices from industry partners resulting in a relatively lower gross margin for that supply. However, as our automation technology further improves our fulfillment efficiencies, along with optimized selling and marketing cost efficiency, our fulfillment expenses ratio in the selling and marketing expense ratio against the total revenues dropped to 8.7% and 7%, delivering on the GAAP OP margin of 2.3%.\\r\\nAlthough 1P gross margin decreased, we were able to provide consumers with more competitive recycling prices and job for experiences. In third quarter, our compliant refurbishment service businesses generated RMB2 billion in revenue, refracting multiple user acceptance of pre-owned electronic devices, especially pre-owned Apple devices.\\r\\nResearch suggests that an iPhone's lifespan can reach up to eight years with 50% of globally activated iPhones being pre-owned devices. While the domestic compliant refurbishment market is still in its early stages, our refurbishment business shows promising growth potential. We anticipate an improvement in overall adjusted operating margins attributable to the growth of refurbish business and Apple businesses.\\r\\nThank you for the question.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAs there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to hand the conference back to management for closing remarks.\\n\\nJeremy Ji\\n\\nThank you.

Undoubtedly, the company’s virtual assistant, Siri, doesn’t seem too impressive in the age of ChatGPT. Though generative AI technologies, like large language models (LLMs), have been touted by many firms, Apple has continued to stay on the down-low regarding its AI ambitions. Nonetheless, various reports suggest Apple is investing heavily in AI to keep up with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\\n\\nReportedly, Apple has a big stake in the generative AI game and is en route to spending around $1 billion on its development, according to a recent Bloomberg report. For now, it’s impossible to tell where Apple stands in the generative AI race. Given its size and ability to innovate (and dominate markets it enters), I’d certainly not be surprised if the firm has an AI product — next-gen Siri, Apple GPT, or something else — that’s even more capable than the latest iteration of ChatGPT.\\n\\nAs Apple quietly invests in its own take on AI, I continue to be bullish on the stock, even as the doubters doubt and the stock slowly begins to flirt with new all-time highs again.\\n\\nApple is an AI Stock, Even if the Market Doubts Its Potential\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Apple is famous for letting its hardware and software do the hype-building for it. Looking ahead, expect Apple to continue taking on a more product- and consumer-oriented approach rather than letting AI hog the podium — something other AI-savvy tech firms seem to be doing of late.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, this entails treating AI not as the main focal point but as something working behind the scenes to make the lives of its customers easier. At the end of the day, the features that generative AI technologies make possible are a part of the magic of new tech-driven features. And as you may know, Apple is all about delivering products and experiences that work almost “like magic.” In that regard, a truly fantastic magician never reveals the full extent of his secrets.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCould Apple’s App Store be Pressured by OpenAI’s GPTs?\\n\\nOpenAI’s recent DevDay unveiled some pretty exciting new features, including GPTs, which allow for customizable chatbots. However, more recently, the board’s short-lived ousting of CEO Sam Altman was the bombshell that hogged all the attention. As the situation settles and Altman returns to the corner office over at OpenAI, expect the focus to return to the firm’s latest and greatest innovations, which may very well lay down the foundation for its own ecosystem or App Store for AI, as some folks are putting it.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, if you can use a chatbot to order food, answer questions, and carry out various tasks, smartphone app usage could take a bit of a hit. ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood seems to think ChatGPT could be a disruptor to Apple. While Wood has been known to make extremely forward-looking comments, I do think the advent of GPTs could evolve to become a credible threat to Apple’s App Store if it’s complacent.\\n\\nFortunately for Apple shareholders, the company does not seem to be taking the potential of AI lightly, not in the slightest. As Apple continues spending a pretty penny on generative AI tech, the company may be keeping up, stride for stride, with the likes of the market’s most-rewarded AI companies. Further, what ultimately succeeds Apple’s App Store may very well be something of its own creation.\\n\\nRemember, Apple is a firm that’s more than willing to cannibalize its own business as new tech rolls around. The advent of Apple Music may have eaten into iTunes’ sales. But at the end of the day, Apple has a heck of a lot more to gain than lose from the rise of new nascent technologies.\\n\\nAs for when Siri will be ready for the ChatGPT era, a recent report by Mark Gurman suggests that Siri may be in for its big upgrade next year. Additionally, Apple may be ready to sprinkle AI across its offerings (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Apple Music, and Xcode) in the near future.\\n\\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 33 analyst ratings, there are 25 Buys and eight Hold recommendations. The\\xa0average Apple stock price target is $201.99, implying upside potential of 5.6%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $240.00 per share.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on AAPL Shares\\n\\nApple has a lot on the line as generative AI continues to take off. Though 2023 may be a slow year for AI innovations, 2024 could be a year where the firm really makes up for lost time, perhaps allowing it to pull ahead of rivals like Microsoft.\\n\\nDisclosure', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-nasdaq-aapl-siri-004643404.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'MSFT.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.109}}, {'date': '2023-11-22T18:47:15+00:00', 'title': \"Disney: Will Thanksgiving reverse box office slump ?

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett and Jim Cramer Love These 5 Stocks.\\n\\nWe are nearing the end of 2023 that was a rollercoaster ride for investors. Analysts were painting a gloomy picture when the year started but the AI-fueled rally gave a boost to major tech stocks that kept gaining value, defying market expectations. Looking ahead, many analysts expect we might see the end of the euphoria that kept the markets elevated in 2024. BNP Paribas analysts said in the bank’s 2024 outlook report that the catalysts that gave a boost to the stock market in 2023 might lose steam in 2024 as consumer savings dry up. BNP Paribas’ Chief Market Strategist, Daniel Morris, said that among the factors responsible for market optimism in 2023 was fiscal stimulus under the Biden administration, which caused an increase in government spending due to Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\nRecession Delayed Not Cancelled\\n\\nMorris said that the recession that was expected in 2023 was delayed not canceled, and he’s expectating the economy to enter a recession in 2024. The analyst said that the pessimistic expectations were realized in Europe in 2023 and he’s expecting the continent to continue to face challenges this year.\\n\\nMorris also shared some important thoughts on China. He believes the country has been unable to deal with the real estate crisis. He said that unlike the US, where government-backed stimulus was strong after the coronavirus outbreak, government support in China was modest. That’s why when the economy re-opened, the country could not get back to its pre-COVID level of growth as many were expecting.\\n\\nThe 2024 outlook report from UBS is more optimistic. UBS Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele believes while growth is expected to slow down, “lack of recession” would enable to companies to grow earnings in the year. Warren Buffett and Jim Cramer Love these Stocks\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFor this article we first watched several programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and listed down the stocks he has been bullish on throughout the year 2023. We then scanned Warren Buffett’s latest portfolio and picked stocks owned by him that are also loved by Cramer. Some top names in the list include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),\\xa0 The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n10. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)\\n\\nWarren Buffett\\'s Stake Value: $935,773,692\\n\\nA couple of months ago Jim Cramer in a program on CNBC praised Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) CEO Frank Slootman and said the executive is using AI to his advantage. Cramer said that Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is making a big move. Cramer was talking in context of Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)’s quarterly report. Cramer also praised Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)’s business model and said enterprise software and Cloud were making a comeback.\\n\\nLike Snowflake, Cramer and Buffett like Apple Inc.

(NYSE:SNOW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\"\\n\\nDuring an August earnings call, Snowflake management talked about AI and its future plans:\\n\\nGenerative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations.

We have a head-start in this race, with the epicenter of highly curated, optimized and trusted enterprise data. We now have a presence was 639 Global 2000 customers.\\n\\nAI reaches beyond enterprise boundaries. Models need external data to answer challenging questions. Data sharing makes Snowflake uniquely positioned to enable AI workloads. As of Q2, 26% of Snowflake customers are data sharing, up from 20% in the same period last year. Approximately 70% of customers with more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue are data sharing with an average of six stable edges. For years, we focused on the programmability of our platform via Snowpark. We are seeing momentum. In Q2, we added more than 400 Snowpark customers and our consumption grew approximately 70% quarter-over-quarter. The 63% of our Global 2000 customers are using Snowpark on a weekly basis.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\\n\\nWarren Buffett\\'s Stake Value: $1,271,200,000\\n\\nJim Cramer has made several bullish comments on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) throughout this year. Earlier this year Cramer said that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been “fantastic” for the consumer. He was talking in the context of FTC’s lawsuit against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for allegedly maintaining a monopoly. A couple of months ago, Cramer praised Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“Amazon continues to showcase it’s place as one of the most competitively advantaged companies in the world. The company has made significant progress in managing costs and better leveraging existing capacity, driving a strong recovery in its profitability. We think there’s additional room for improvement.\\n\\nAWS growth seems to be stabilizing even while management continues to work with clients to optimize their infrastructure spend. Roughly 90% of global IT spending remains on premise. We believe this will eventually flip, with most IT spending ultimately moving to the cloud over time. We think AWS will be a significant beneficiary of this transition.\\n\\nFurther, our investment case on company profitability driven by AWS and advertising continues to unfold, delivering nearly $8 billion in free cash flow over the trailing twelve months and a net margin of 5%. We expect both to move higher with the mix shift of more profitable businesses growing fastest continuing to take effect.\\n\\nAt Amazon’s current price, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver a mid-teens or higher total shareholder return for our clients over the next five plus years without a Herculean effort from the business. It simply needs to continue executing on current businesses and growing into the capacity it built during and immediately after the pandemic.”\\n\\n8.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Achievers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10.\\n\\nDividend Achievers are a group of companies known for consistently increasing their dividends for 10 years or more. These companies often attract investors seeking stable income and long-term growth potential. The ability to consistently increase dividends is seen as a sign of financial strength and stability, indicating that the company is generating enough cash flow to reward shareholders while still reinvesting in its business. Historically, dividend growers have shown a tendency to outperform the broader market over certain periods. According to a report by Abrdn PLC, for the past two decades, companies that started paying dividends or regularly increased them did better than the overall global index. These dividend growers and initiators did even better than companies that paid dividends without increasing them and those that didn't pay dividends at all. The report also mentioned that dividend growers have also shown less volatility and produced better risk-adjusted returns during this period.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index follows companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years or more. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, it's been a tough challenge for most U.S. active managers to beat this index—more than 98% of them fell short over the last decade. Actually, across all the time frames measured, this index has outpaced most active managers in performance. The report further highlighted that in the ten years until June 2023, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats showed an impressive annualized performance of 12.0%, surpassing other benchmarks by a significant margin. In addition to this, the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the overall stock market significantly. Over the ten years until 2018, the Dividend Aristocrats showed annualized returns of 12.6%, while the S&P 500 only had annualized returns of 9.7% during that period, according to Forbes. The index delivered these returns with lower volatility than the S&P 500.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nEven though the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index isn't keeping up with the overall market this year, companies that consistently raise dividends are still holding their ground. The S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, tracking U.S. companies that have increased dividends yearly for at least 10 years straight, has shown a 6.99% gain this year. Some of the top holdings of the index are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).

With so many sales happening all at once, it can be overwhelming trying to determine what you should buy. After evaluating the upcoming deals and discounts at popular retailers like Best Buy, Amazon and Walmart, one particular product category stands out as the smartest buy this Black Friday — laptops.\\n\\nTake a Look: Costco 2023 Black Friday Deals You Shouldn’t Pass Up\\r\\nFind Out: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday Purchases\\n\\nLaptops are notoriously expensive purchases, so Black Friday presents a rare opportunity to score major savings on these indispensable devices.\\xa0Here are three of the best Black Friday laptop deals.\\n\\nSponsored: Open a new checking account and earn early paycheck access; up to 2 days early with Discover® Cashback Debit with Early Pay\\n\\nBest Overall Laptop Deal\\n\\nBest Buy is rolling out fantastic laptop deals for Black Friday, but one, in particular, stands out as an unbeatable value. According to Samantha Landau, consumer expert at TopCashback USA, “You can score a Samsung Galaxy Book 3 with a touchscreen and the Intel Evo Core i7 for $999.99 (originally $1,549.99). This is a steal for this device.”\\n\\nThis Samsung Galaxy Book 3 deal makes for an exceptionally worthwhile Black Friday buy. With robust specs like 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a touchscreen display, it’s a powerful and versatile laptop great for work, play and everything in between. Marked down $550 from its original price, this is a deep discount on a laptop with stellar reviews.\\n\\nStores With Layaway in 2023: Extending Your Purchasing Power\\n\\nBest Budget Laptop Deal\\n\\nAmazon is offering major markdowns on laptops for Black Friday, but the ACEMAGIC 15.6-inch laptop deal stands out in particular. Ordinarily priced at $1,299.99, it’s on sale this year for just $359.99. “That’s a 72% discount, making it one of the best deals out there,” said Landau.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhile the ACEMAGIC brand may not be as recognizable as Samsung or Apple, this deal is appealing because of the huge discount. Landau rightly pointed out, “It should be noted that the brand is not as well-known, so take that into account before indulging in this deal in case you’re concerned about tech support availability.”\\n\\nThe specs, including a 15.6-inch Full HD display, Intel Celeron N4020 processor, 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, are solid for the price. For bargain hunters less concerned with brand reputation, however, the technical specifications and price reduction make this laptop a can’t-miss deal.\\n\\nBest Apple Laptop Deal\\n\\nFinding deals on Apple products is notoriously difficult, which is why Walmart’s Black Friday discount on a 13.3-inch MacBook Air bundle is too good to ignore. As Landau said, “Starting on Nov. 22, you can score a restored 13.3-inch MacBook Air bundle including a wireless mouse, black case and a pair of Bluetooth earbuds for only $399.” For devotees of Apple laptops, this will undoubtedly be the single best Black Friday deal this year.\\n\\nEven without the extras, a MacBook Air for $399 would be an unbelievable bargain. But Walmart sweetens this already amazing deal by adding in a wireless mouse, laptop case and Bluetooth earbuds, all for the same $399 price.\\n\\n“Apple laptops are great for education and general everyday use, so this is really a steal — especially with all of the extra goodies you get!” said Landau.\\n\\nMore From GOBankingRates\\n\\nYour $20 Bill May Be Worth More Than You Think: How To Look Up the Serial Number Don't Shop at Wegmans on This Day of the Week 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 The 4 Fastest Ways To Destroy Your Credit\\n\\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Single Best Thing To Buy on Black Friday in 2023\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/single-best-thing-buy-black-120018236.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.167}}, {'date': '2023-11-22T11:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Some Charts Are Like Comparing Apples and JPMorgans', 'content': \"Let's tackle some tough reads, and see why certain stocks seem allowed to trade like JPM and AAPL, as others trade like Bank of America.\\n\\nContinue reading\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/487d97c5-eedd-3856-96b0-c15cec48c47d/some-charts-are-like.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.681, 'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.225}}, {'date': '2023-11-22T10:30:00+00:00', 'title': 'Incognito Mode Isn’t Doing What You Think It’s Doing', 'content': 'There is an urban myth that says online shoppers who doggedly search for certain items on the web get tagged by algorithms that then cause them to see higher prices than others shopping for those same items.

Being a mature and established enterprise lends Apple to criticism that it’s boring. At the same time, pressure on the consumer economy implies a loss of relevance. Still, the company commands massive pricing power, making it a worthwhile investment to consider. I am bullish on AAPL stock for its resilience under pressure.\\n\\nBreaking Down AAPL’s Recent Results\\n\\nFor starters, Apple’s most recent earnings print for its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 provided a confidence boost for investors. Heading into the report, confidence was generally high. However, analysts pointed to concerns about weakness in the company’s hardware sales. That’s not surprising, given global demand worries – particularly in China – as well as supply constraint issues. Still, Apple delivered the goods like it usually does.\\n\\nAs TipRanks contributor Abdulrasaq Ariwoola reported, earnings per share landed at $1.46, beating the consensus target of $1.39 per share. On the top line, sales did happen to decrease 0.7% on a year-over-year basis to $89.46 billion. Nevertheless, this tally slightly exceeded analysts’ expectations, which called for $89.28 billion.\\n\\nAs for the hardware components, Apple’s iPhone sales rang up $43.81 billion, in line with Wall Street’s projections. In addition, this print represented a 2% lift from the year-ago quarter’s tally. Similarly, iPad revenue enjoyed an encouraging performance, reaching $6.44 billion, which beat the consensus view of $6.07 billion.\\n\\nIn fairness, it wasn’t all positive for AAPL stock. Sales related to Apple’s Mac computers slipped, coming out to $7.61 billion against an expected $8.63 billion. Further, to Ariwoola’s point, shares initially fell in after-hours trading following the earnings disclosure.\\n\\nThat could be due to options market dynamics. Both before and after the disclosure, options flow data showed bearish trades – both bought puts and sold calls – that may have impacted sentiment. Still, it appears that the power of the fundamentals has taken over the narrative.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGross Margin Trend Confirms Apple’s Pricing Power\\n\\nAs impressive as the Fiscal Q4 print was for Apple, what could really drive AAPL stock higher for the long haul could be its pricing power. To be clear, no company is completely immune from outside pressures. For example, inflation remains stubbornly high. If the Federal Reserve wants to take the gloves off with aggressively higher interest rates, that could roil the economy.\\n\\nNevertheless, the company’s gross margin continues to march higher despite obvious headwinds impacting the consumer economy. In Fiscal Q4, Apple posted a gross margin of 45.2%. In the year-ago quarter, this metric sat at 42.3%. This is a strong indicator that, irrespective of increased prices, consumers will continue to buy Apple products. That bodes very well for AAPL stock.\\n\\nSince Q4 of Fiscal 2020, when Apple’s gross margin landed at 38.2%, this metric has witnessed a dramatic surge higher. In a hyperbolic sense, the company enjoys the license to print money. Of course, as the Mac sales decline shows, Apple can’t afford to casually drop the ball. However, the fact that so many people continue to buy the firm’s products in large quantities demonstrates practically unparalleled influence.\\n\\nLet’s face it – there’s not much distinguishing one smart device brand from another these days. Nevertheless, Apple benefits from a social cachet that its rivals lack. Not even inflationary economic conditions can dent this market presence. That’s a huge positive for AAPL stock.\\n\\nNot Cheap, but Effective\\n\\nIf one knock does exist about AAPL stock, it’s that the security trades at a high earnings premium. Right now, the market prices AAPL at about a trailing-year multiple of 31x. Generally speaking, Apple falls under the computer hardware sector, which runs a price/earnings ratio of 18.5x.\\n\\nAt the same time, the bullish argument for AAPL stock centers on the predictability of the earnings trajectory. Facing uncertain market conditions, business predictability should command a higher premium over enterprises that are merely cheap. Given Apple’s consistent strengths amid widespread pressure, that’s a premium worth absorbing.\\n\\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nTurning to Wall Street, AAPL stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average AAPL stock price target is $201.99, implying 5.95% upside potential.\\n\\nThe Takeaway: AAPL Stock is Boring but Dependable\\n\\nAs an established player, no one should expect AAPL stock to be an exciting investment. However, for those concerned about the ambiguities of what may lie ahead in the new year, Apple brings a strong platform to the table. With the company consistently attracting consumer dollars despite significant headwinds, AAPL stock is worthy of consideration.\\n\\nDisclosure', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-nasdaq-aapl-boring-commands-025002637.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.984, 'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.103}}, {'date': '2023-11-22T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nAdam Spatacco\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 22, 2023\\n', 'content': 'Warren Buffett is one of the most prolific investors of his generation.

Thiruvananthapuram\\'s Technopark in Kerala is the largest IT park in India, accommodating several tech activities, including smart card technology and animation.\\n\\nThe top Indian IT companies by revenue, such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and Wipro, play a pivotal role in India\\'s IT landscape. TCS, with $23 billion in revenue in 2020, is the world\\'s largest IT services provider. Infosys, founded in 1981, operates globally, providing software development, consulting, and information technology services. Wipro, initially a manufacturer of vegetable oils, shifted its focus to IT during the 1970s and 1980s, becoming the third-largest IT company in India.\\n\\nThe Indian startup ecosystem is also thriving, with companies like One97 Communications (operating Paytm), Ola Cabs, OYO, ReNew Power, and Snapdeal securing substantial venture capital funding. India was also recognized by the 2020 Global Innovation Index as the third-best startup economy globally, showcasing the country\\'s vibrant entrepreneurial spirit and potential for technological innovation.

In addition to the smartphone initiative, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) revealed plans to enable users to book metro tickets through the Google Maps app and announced a partnership with Indian non-bank lender DMI Finance to provide small loans for merchants via Google Pay.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has set its eyes on India to make it a key player for the company’s global merchandise exports by targeting $20 billion by 2025. Launched in 2015, Amazon Global Trade, the B2C export platform, has swiftly evolved into a cornerstone for Amazon\\'s international commerce. The platform, now having over 100,000 small manufacturers, serves as a testament to India\\'s importance as a hub for the e-commerce giant. The demand for \"Made in India\" products, ranging from organic health supplements to homeware and robotic games, is on the rise.\\n\\nDespite a broader economic downturn, India\\'s importance for Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is evident in the platform\\'s major growth, especially in categories like beauty, apparel, home, kitchen, furniture, and toys. The company\\'s strategic initiative includes not just expanding its footprint in the country but also empowering local exporters. Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s decision to slash subscription fees for its global selling program, from $120 to a mere $1 for the initial three months, is a testament to its commitment to encourage and facilitate Indian exporters. With festivals and major global sales events driving sales, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) recognizes India\\'s role as a crucial contributor to its global merchandise exports. 12 Highest Paying Programming Languages in India\\n\\nCopyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nTo list and rank the highest-paying programming languages in India, we relied on the base average salaries of developers of the respective languages in India.

Sonos looks to charge between $150 and $200 for that device, which would run apps from popular streaming services.\\n\\nThe company is also developing new amplifiers and in-ceiling speakers aimed at professional installers, as well as a higher-end TV sound bar, new subwoofers, an update to the portable Roam speaker and a version of its Era 100 speaker for businesses. And it’s planning an updated voice control system, video service and upgraded smartphone app.\\n\\nSonos shares pared losses Tuesday on news of the product push. After falling nearly 4% earlier in the session, they were down about 2% as of 1:10 p.m. in New York.\\n\\nThe new products are part of a bid by Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence to reignite growth at the audio technology company, which suffered a sales decline in the past year. Demand for smart speakers has cooled, and products like headphones are seen as an opportunity to leverage the Sonos brand to find a new moneymaker.\\n\\nTiming and details of the releases could ultimately shift as the products get closer. A representative for Santa Barbara, California-based Sonos declined to comment on the company’s plans.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSonos recently reorganized its product development group to better focus on promising areas, Bloomberg News reported last week. The company cut jobs as part of the shake-up.\\n\\nOn an earnings call earlier this month, Spence acknowledged that 2023 has been a “challenging year” for Sonos’ current lineup. But he vowed to push next year into a “major new product in a new multibillion-dollar category,” without specifying the market. He said he expects new products to drive a “large portion” of revenue by the second half of the year.\\n\\nSpence hinted at the slew of new devices in development, telling investors that 2024 “marks the beginning of a multiyear product cycle” that will provide a payoff for years of research-and-development spending.\\n\\nThe company has been working on its headphones since 2019, when Bloomberg first reported on the effort. But it’s never announced a product, having canceled work on earlier iterations. A model is now slated to be unveiled as soon as March, with the headphones hitting store shelves the following month, the people familiar with the plan said.\\n\\nThe over-ear-style headphones — code-named “Duke” — will face off against the $549 AirPods Max from Apple, as well as high-end offerings from Sony Group Corp. and Bose Corp. They’ll come in black and white color options, synchronize with Sonos equipment and offer voice control for navigating between songs. The company is considering charging between $400 and $500 for the product.\\n\\nSonos is also exploring a follow-up product, the people said: an earbud model that would look similar to Apple’s AirPods.\\n\\nSome of the technology in the new headphones comes from RHA Audio, an Irish company that Sonos acquired two years ago. But the company isn’t trying to outperform Apple on a technical basis — its marketing message will be more about leveraging the Sonos brand and its ability to fine-tune the sound, the people said.\\n\\nThe company is planning to release software soon internally named “Passport” that will let users control the headphones and other mobile Sonos gear from a smartphone app when away from their home internet.\\n\\nThe headphones will include the current version of Sonos voice commands — already available on speakers — while a more advanced version dubbed Voice 2.0 is coming in the second half of 2024.\\n\\nBy the end of next year or early 2025, Sonos plans to enter a second new category: TV set-top boxes and video. The company is working on a device — code-named “Pinewood” — that can stream video on TVs and serve as a central hub for a customer’s other Sonos devices. The product will operate similarly to existing set-top boxes, offering its own operating system — based on Android — and a user interface that can display different apps.\\n\\nSonos has held discussions with cable companies about offering live television and plans to partner with existing popular video streaming services, including Netflix Inc., to build apps for the new platform. The device will offer Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, popular audio and video standards, and have the ability to create immersive surround sound using Sonos home speakers.\\n\\nThe small, black TV box will be controlled via voice — as well as the new Sonos app — and the company is exploring the idea of launching its own video service. Other set-top box makers, including Roku and Apple, followed up on hardware offerings with streaming services.\\n\\nThe company is also working on new home theater equipment, including a subwoofer code-named “Lotus” that will synchronize with the TV device. That product, an update to the Sub, will include updated capabilities like support for Wi-Fi 6. Further out, Sonos is considering releasing a higher-end subwoofer.\\n\\nFor around the middle of 2024, Sonos is planning a second-generation Roam speaker — code-named “Sidecar” — with a redesigned top that includes a touch-controlled slider for volume control. That matches the new design of the company’s home speakers and recently launched Move 2 portable speaker.\\n\\nSonos is also planning a pricier version of its Era 100 speaker — code-named “Raven” — with an Ethernet port instead of wireless networking. It will be aimed at restaurants and retail stores rather than homes.\\n\\nAnd a sound bar code-named “Lasso” is coming later in 2024, with better bass and improved audio quality over the existing Arc model. The company is planning to charge about $1,200 for it, up from the $900 price tag on the current high-end version. The sound bar’s new technology is based on Sonos’ 2022 acquisition of Mayht Holding BV, which developed advanced speaker components.\\n\\nFinally, Sonos is planning a new high-end amplifier — code-named “Premier” — aimed at professional home-theater installations. The company is considering charging between $3,000 and $4,000 for each unit. That will come in the second half of 2024, preceded by new 8-inch in-ceiling speakers.\\n\\n(Updates with Sonos shares in fourth paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nMore Americans on Ozempic Means Smaller Plates at Thanksgiving The Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High Guatemalan Town Invests Remittance Dollars to Deter Migration At REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes Inflation Raging in Triple Digits Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sonos-readies-400-plus-headphones-181408315.html', 'symbols': ['8SO.F', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'SONO.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.993, 'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.064}}, {'date': '2023-11-21T16:49:13+00:00', 'title': '12 Countries With Best Incentives For Expats', 'content': 'In this article, we will talk about 12 countries with the best incentives for expats.

People leave their countries in search of better opportunities and lifestyles or for better security and safety. You can check out our article on European countries with best healthcare for expats.\\n\\nA Brief Overview of Global Mobility\\n\\nCompanies incentivize employee relocation to attract better talent. The trend of employee relocation is especially considerable for tech companies. On August 30, Forbes published an article noting that relocation programs can be cost-effective on top of helping companies retain and build a diverse and skilled talent pool and network. Instead of going through the tedious process of finding and training talent, companies can relocate the people that best suit the job description from anywhere in the world. Employee mobility therefore is not only a feasible consideration for growth but also a desirable feature.\\n\\nRelocation programs offer mutual gain of value for both the company and the hired talent. According to a report by Crown World Mobility, a staggering 82% of businesses said that they had offered relocation programs to retain talent post-pandemic. The pandemic proved that the majority of the roles can be fulfilled remotely and if an employee requests for relocation on a personal account, it is difficult to turn down.\\n\\nMany distinct industries are growing alongside the popularity of relocation programs and growing numbers of expats, including the global immigration consulting market. According to a report by Valuates Reports, the global immigration consulting services market was valued at $14.2 billion in 2022 and has been estimated to grow to $21.1 billion by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate of 5.73%. Immigration consulting services enable expats to have a smooth transition in line with international rules and regulations. Most companies in the immigration consultancy services market are private, including CD&R, WWICS, and Global Immigration Network.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nClayton, Dubilier & Rice is a private investment firm. The acquisition of PwC\\'s global mobility tax and immigration services business by the company in 2021 has made it a noteworthy name in the immigration consultancy market, especially for employees moving abroad. The unit offers tax and immigration services. On August 31, CD&R also announced the completion of the acquisition of Focus Financial Partners Inc. Focus provides wealth management services to its clients while maintaining its operational independence. The CEO of Focus said that the company is optimistic about this acquisition as it is the \"next chapter of growth and evolution\".\\n\\nNoteworthy Companies Offering Relocation Assistance\\n\\nAccording to the Expat Insider 2023 report, the United States of America is one of the top five countries that host the most expats. The USA offers good prospects for professional growth and has a suitable local job market. Some of the most prominent American companies that offer relocation assistance within and outside the country include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and\\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest tech companies offering relocation programs for expats. The company facilitates the employees throughout the entire process of relocation, starting from visa and immigration to finding housing and cultural training. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also facilitates its current employees to travel between countries to gain experience and achieve personal growth goals. The company is expanding in new locations as well, which will further help these relocation programs.\\n\\nOn October 24, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will spend $3.2 billion to expand its artificial intelligence and cloud computing abilities in Australia. The company is aiming to increase its cloud computing capacity in the country by 250%. To keep up with the evolving digital economy in Australia, the company will train 300,000 Australians. The company will promote innovation and growth while increasing its data center footprint in Australia. This would also open the opportunity for mobility for both new and old employees at the company.\\n\\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an energy company that specializes in oil and gas. The company also offers relocation assistance for eligible positions. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is expanding, and growth helps nurture more prospects for new employees. On October 23, Reuters reported that the company had agreed to buy Hess to keep up with its competitors. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) aims to achieve energy security through this measure. The all-stock deal was finalized for $53 billion.\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers extensive relocation packages that ease the employee\\'s transition. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also expanding operations to new countries, further adding to the popularity of the world-renowned brand. On October 27, Reuters reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have a new assembly unit in India operated by the Tata Group. The company aims to boost its growth and shift manufacturing from China to India. By entering new countries and expanding operations, tech companies open doors for new talent seeking to benefit from them.\\n\\nTech companies are one of the prime actors in encouraging people to move to new countries. They facilitate the transition of expats, providing them with new opportunities for growth and development. Some countries also encourage people to move there through various programs and policies. We have made a list of the countries with the best incentives for expats to help you make the best decision.  12 Countries With Best Incentives For Expats\\n\\n12 Countries With Best Incentives For Expats\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo make our list of the countries with the best incentives for expats, we extracted our data from the Expat Insider 2023 report by InterNations.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to Semiconductor R&D Spending By Company: Top 5.\\n\\nThe Global Semiconductor Shortage\\n\\nSemiconductors are vital for the majority of technologies around us including automobiles, communications systems, computers, household appliances, and more. These tiny chips witnessed an extreme shortage during the pandemic when consumer demands suddenly shifted. People became more inclined towards consumer electronics and PCs, due to the rise of remote work and education, while vehicle sales dropped. The industry also faced massive supply chain disruption and logistical issues that further fueled the shortage.\\n\\nThe semiconductor industry is currently in its recovery phase. Many semiconductor products including smartphones have even come a full circle from being short to having a surplus. One of the most prominent semiconductors that still seem to be struggling are the GPUs used for training and developing AI applications like ChatGPT. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the market and controls almost 80% of the supply. The reliance on this singular giant in the semiconductor GPU market slowed the progress of many companies developing generative AI products.\\n\\nGenerative AI companies have been struggling to meet their needs as the supply is limited to one dominant company. To keep up, generative AI companies have started to explore more options and overcome this shortage. On October 6, Reuters reported that OpenAI is exploring the option of making its own chips instead of relying on external chipmakers. By making its chips, the company will be able to reach its goals for expansion without potential delays caused by the shortage. It will also enable the company to have more control and diversity in its supply.\\n\\nGovernments across the globe have also become more alert to the issue of semiconductor shortages and are making efforts to nurture its growth. Many countries have announced attractive government incentives to encourage companies to set up manufacturing and production in them. The CHIPS and Science Act by the United States government is noteworthy. According to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the earnest implementation of the Act that began at the start of 2023 has gathered $200 billion in private investments. Even in light of the semiconductor market tug-of-war between the US and China, implementing the CHIPS Act can potentially create thousands of jobs and foster the semiconductor ecosystem in the country. The close involvement of the governments could move the semiconductor shortage in the right direction, overcoming the ongoing slump.

So that\\'s my role is to make sure there\\'s several for the board to pick from.\"\\n\\nCook\\'s tenure as CEO\\n\\nDespite his multiple decades with the company—the past 12 years of which have been as CEO—Apple is a brand still synonymous with the eminent Steve Jobs.\\n\\nBut Cook—who was paid $49 million in 2023—isn\\'t envious of this association, indeed he revealed he is continually humbled to lead the team of more than 160,000 people.\\n\\nIn August 2011, when Cook was named Apple CEO the company\\'s share price was under $13 dollars—now it stands at more than 14 times that at $191.45, up 53% this year alone.\\n\\nBut for the massive growth—and returns its shareholders have seen—Cook doesn\\'t want glory, saying he is incredibly privileged to lead Apple and says it\\'s his job to now give back.\\n\\n\"Steve was an original,\" Cook said. \"I think only Steve could have created Apple and we owe him a debt of gratitude. There\\'s no doubt in my mind that if he were still alive today the company would be doing outstanding, and he would still be CEO.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think of it as a \\'credit\\' deal—plus I get to work with people I love and that are unbelievable at doing what they do.

It\\'s one of two antitrust cases against Google, whose tech empire valued at $1.7 trillion is being threatened by legal attacks seeking to break it up.\\n\\nTestimony in the Android phone app case is scheduled to finish before Christmas.\\n\\nThe other case, focused on Google\\'s dominant search engine, ended last week, but won\\'t be decided by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., until next year.\\n\\nWhile Sweeney sought to depict Google as a greedy monopolist under questioning by his own lawyer, Google attorney Jonathan Kravis tried to flip the script. Much of Kravis\\' his cross-examination appeared design to cast Sweeney as an executive primarily interested in bypassing a long-standing commission system to boost his video game company\\'s profits.\\n\\nEpic, the maker of the popular Fortnite game, alleges that Google has been engaged in illegal price-gouging by collecting commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app digital transactions. It\\'s similar to a payment system that Epic unsuccessfully challenged in a parallel lawsuit filed against Apple\\'s iPhone app store. Epic is appealing the outcome of the Apple trial to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nUnlike Apple\\'s iPhone app store, Google already allows competition to the Play Store — something that Epic tried to do when it decided to roll out Fortnite for Android phones in 2018 on its own website instead of the Play Store.\\n\\nIn his Monday testimony, Sweeney recalled how Google called him into its Mountain View, California, headquarters to try to persuade Epic to release Fortnite in the Play Store instead. Sweeney said Google tried to entice him with a wide range of financial incentives, which he rejected.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“It seemed like a crooked arrangement,” Sweeney told the jury. “Google was proposing a series of side deals, which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them.”\\n\\nSweeney\\'s appearance came after Epic\\'s lawyers had previously displayed Google documents showing Google had offered video game maker Activision Blizzard a package valued at $360 million to drop a tentative plan to compete against the Play Store.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s lawyers presented other documents that outlined the deal would bring more than $315 million in benefits to Activision.\\n\\nAfter rejecting Google\\'s overtures, Epic tried to distribute Fortnite for Android through its own website. But Sweeney testified that effort quickly turned into “a depressing process\" because far fewer game players downloaded Fortnite for Android phones than anticipated. He attributed the disappointing response to Google machinations that made it a cumbersome process to do outside the Play Store and the use of pop-up “scare screens” warning of potential problems with the software.\\n\\n“We realized Google was a difficult adversary and had the ability obstruct us,” Sweeney said.\\n\\nEpic eventually released Fortnite in the Play Store in 2020 while it was hatching a secret plan to eventually circumvent the commission system by covertly slipping in an alternate payment option as part of what Sweeney dubbed “Project Liberty.”\\n\\nThe alternative payment option was released in August 2020 in revised Fortnite apps for both the Play Store and the iPhone app store, prompting both Apple and Google to block it within a few hours. Epic then filed antitrust lawsuits as part of what Sweeney framed as a crusade on behalf of all game makers as more play occurs on smartphones instead of consoles and PCs.\\n\\n“It\\'s an issue I see as existential to all games, including Epic,” Sweeney said.\\n\\nDuring his questioning of Sweeney, Google lawyer Kravis laid out the 30% commissions that Epic pays to Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo for transactions on the PlayStation, Xbox and Switch consoles without complaint while still raking in billions of dollars in profit from those platforms.\\n\\nIn response to a question submitted by a juror, Sweeney disclosed that video game consoles and personal computers generated more than 90% of Epic\\'s revenue from in-app purchases during the period in 2020 when Fortnite was also in the iPhone app store and the Play Store.\\n\\nSweeney didn\\'t say why Epic hasn\\'t mounted a challenge to the 30% commissions charge on other game-playing devices besides smartphones, but he left no doubt about his goal in this trial.\\n\\n“We want the jury to find Google has violated the law so the court can force Google to stop these practices,” Sweeney said.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-fortnite-game-maker-casts-010106452.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.891, 'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.1}}, {'date': '2023-11-21T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nDani Cook\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 21, 2023\\n', 'content': 'These companies offer much more value than Amazon, yet have similar growth potential over the long term.', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/11/21/ignore-amazon-these-2-stocks-will-be-long-term-win/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.74, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.659, 'pos': 0.341}}, {'date': '2023-11-21T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'The Next Tech Battlefield: Apple’s Position in the Emerging AI Landscape', 'content': 'Apple isn’t a guaranteed loser in generative AI.

The jury trial started two weeks ago and is expected to wrap up in early December. If Epic prevails, Google could be forced to allow competing app marketplaces and payment methods on its app store, threatening billions of dollars in revenue generated by Google Play.\\n\\nSweeney previously testified in a 2021 trial in a similar antitrust targeting Apple Inc.’s App Store policies as unfair and self-serving. Epic mostly lost that fight, which was decided by a federal judge in Oakland, California, after a trial. An appeals court upheld the judge’s ruling and Epic is now asking the US Supreme Court to review it.\\n\\nThe Epic CEO testified that Google tried to cut a deal with his company that he rejected and went on to strike “secret” accords with mobile device makers to maintain Google Play as the dominant Android app marketplace.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSweeney said in 2018 he believed Android wasn’t closed to developers, but subsequently realized Google’s operating system was a “fake open platform” that was actually just as closed as he found Apple’s App Store to be in terms of policies for developers.\\n\\nTencent Holdings\\n\\nEpic made $5.1 billion in revenue in 2020, Sweeney revealed when he testified in the Apple case. He founded Cary, North Carolina-based Epic in 1991, when he was still a student at the University of Maryland. It has since grown into one of the world’s biggest closely held video-game companies, with Sweeney as the majority shareholder and China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. controlling a 40% stake.\\n\\nSweeney, whose net worth is estimated at $9.7 billion, is a long-time advocate of open software ecosystems. He’s also known for his love for hiking and conservation efforts, including purchasing land to be turned into public parks.\\n\\nSince the 2017 release of the “battle royale” game Fortnite, Epic has become a household name among video-game enthusiasts and the game has more than 400 million users.

Last week the media watchdog group Media Matters also published a report that found ads from major brands, including Amazon (AMZN) and IBM (IBM), had been placed alongside posts on X that supported white nationalism and Nazism. Elon Musk is Tesla\\'s and SpaceX\\'s CEO as well as the owner of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, Pool) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\\n\\nMusk has threatened to sue Media Matters over their findings. Media Matters president and CEO Angelo Carusone said in a statement that Musk is \"far from the free speech advocate he claims to be.\" \"Musk is a bully who threatens meritless lawsuits in an attempt to silence reporting,\" Carusone continued. \"If he does sue us, we will win.\"\\n\\nX referred Yahoo Finance to Yaccarino\\'s prior remarks when asked about advertiser pressures.\\n\\n\"Elon Musk has made himself into someone that marketers cannot be seen to do business with,\" said Lou Paskalis, the founder and chief executive of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory. \"His increasingly erratic and recently antisemitic tweets and retweets, particularly at a time of rising religious tensions around the globe, have made it impossible for any responsible brand to buy advertising on X,\" he said on Monday.\\n\\nAd executives have also implored Yaccarino to step down, according to Paskalis, since working alongside Musk — and appearing to defend his behavior — risks damaging her own reputation.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut on Monday in a post on X, Yaccarino appeared to reject calls for her to step aside.\\n\\n\"I believe deeply in our vision, our team, and our community. I’m also deeply committed to the truth and there is no other team on earth working as hard as the teams at X. When you’re this consequential, there will be detractors and fabricated distractions, but we’re unwavering in our mission,\" she said.\\n\\nThe halt of advertising among some of corporate America\\'s biggest names highlights ongoing tensions that have defined Musk\\'s ownership of X and his incendiary leadership style. Apple (AAPL), Disney (DIS), and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) were among the companies to suspend their advertising on X. The White House also blasted Musk for endorsing what it described as a \"hideous\" antisemitic conspiracy theory.\\n\\nSimilar to previous bouts of Musk-like behavior, Yaccarino reverted to damage control mode. “X’s point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board — I think that’s something we can and should all agree on,” she wrote on X last week, after the initial backlash to Musk\\'s remarks.\\n\\nQuestions over how Twitter would handle the thorny issue of content moderation gained even more importance after Musk\\'s buyout last year. Once he took the company private for $44 billion, Musk dramatically cut down the size of Twitter\\'s staff, including through layoffs of those who were responsible for keeping abusive and bigoted content off the platform.\\n\\nAs of last month, X was valued at $19 billion, according to stock grants for employees.\\n\\nMusk\\'s behavior on X carries broader significance for the other companies he runs, including Tesla (TSLA), which, unlike Twitter, is publicly traded.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never had this with any company I\\'ve ever invested in ever in my life where the CEO of the company himself does so many detrimental things that [are] destroying the brand,\" said longtime Tesla bull Ross Gerber, head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.\\n\\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13-F filing showed that Berkshire’s $313 billion portfolio was invested in 45 companiesin the third quarter of 2023. Berkshire was a net seller of about $5.3 billion in stocks during the quarter.\\n\\nBuffett is outright bullish on Apple AAPL despite its slowing growth. Apple remains his largest holding at a staggering 50% allocation. Buffett famously loves cash-rich companies. Even though Apple’s growth has slowed, it still has a hoard of cash on hand. However, Buffett pared a small holding in Amazon (AMZN).\\n\\nInvestors intending to follow Buffett and be part of Apple’s value as well as growth story, can play ETFs like iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW, Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK and Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT).\\n\\nDavid Tepper Bets on Big Tech\\n\\nTepper expects the strength in big-cap tech to continue. His top five positions include Nvidia NVDA (increased stake by 580%), Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon (AMZN), and Alibaba (BABA). With interest rates likely to fall in 2024 and tech being the essence of the new normal lifestyle, Tepper’s bets make sense.

In the past, Druckenmiller has compared the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) with the Internet, making it unsurprising that he has a significant allocation in this sector.\\n\\nAlthough he decreased his position in NVDA, it still constitutes his largest investment, suggesting his continued optimism about the stock while possibly engaging in tactical trading within his core position. Nvidia has a solid position in VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI.\\n\\nFollow Bill Ackman by Investing in Alphabet\\n\\nBill Ackman, too, has exposure to AI.

Sam Altman is set to join Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after a dramatic weekend saw his ouster from the helm of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Elsewhere, Cruise boss Kyle Vogt resigns following a series of recent missteps at the robotaxi group.\\n\\n1. Futures inch up\\n\\nU.S. stock futures hovered just above the flatline to begin a holiday-shortened trading week, with investors looking ahead to upcoming minutes from the Federal Reserve\\'s latest meeting as they attempt to gauge the central bank\\'s future policy path.\\n\\nBy 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 26 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had gained 6 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 32 points or 0.2%.\\n\\nThe main indices on Wall Street ended the prior session marginally in the green, helping the benchmark S&P 500 and 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average post their first three-week winning streaks since the summer. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged to its best week since June.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, traders will have the opportunity to parse through minutes from the Fed\\'s November meeting, where officials chose to keep interest rates steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%. The release will likely be one of the highlights of the economic calendar in a week truncated by Thanksgiving festivities.\\n\\nCorporate earnings this week will also feature quarterly figures from Nvidia, the California chipmaker that has become a focal point of this year\\'s surge in enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence. Lowe\\'s (NYSE:LOW) will report as well, becoming the latest big-box retailer to provide an update on the state of the U.S. consumer heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.\\n\\n2. Altman to run Microsoft\\'s new AI team - Nadella\\n\\nMicrosoft is set to hire Sam Altman to lead a new advanced artificial intelligence research team, in a move that comes just days after the prominent AI-industry figure was ousted as CEO of OpenAI.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn a post on social media platform X announcing the appointment, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote that he is \"look[ing] forward to moving quickly\" to provide Altman and Greg Brockman -- who was also removed from his role as OpenAI president -- \"with the resources needed for their success.\"\\n\\nEarlier on Monday, The Information reported that Altman, one of the leading voices in a global debate over the rapid expansion of nascent AI technology, will no longer return as OpenAI\\'s CEO despite executive efforts to rehire him. The report cited an internal address by co-founder and board director Ilya Sutskever.\\n\\nInstead, OpenAI will hire streaming site Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear as interim CEO, according to media reports.\\n\\nAltman was seen meeting with OpenAI’s board over the weekend, after he was unexpectedly sacked on Friday and replaced on an interim basis by Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. The turmoil, which The Information said followed an internal disagreement over AI safety, threatens to cast a pall over the direction of OpenAI just one week after its megapopular chatbot ChatGPT reached 100 million weekly users.\\n\\n3. Cruise CEO resigns\\n\\nThe chief executive of General Motors-backed Cruise has stepped down in the wake of a highly-publicized accident that led to the halt of its self-driving vehicle operations.\\n\\nCEO Kyle Vogt confirmed his departure in a post on X on Sunday, adding that the group \"is still just getting started, and I believe it has a great future ahead.\"\\n\\nReuters reported that Vogt, who founded the firm in 2013, told employees in an email that he had \"resigned from my position.\" Earlier in the weekend, Vogt had reportedly apologized to staff, saying \"[t]here are no excuses, and there is no sugar coating what has happened.\"\\n\\nThe leadership shake-up comes after the California Department of Motor Vehicles accused Cruise of not disclosing all video footage of an accident in October in which a pedestrian was dragged by one of its self-drive taxis. Cruise has said it \"proactively shared\" information with authorities.\\n\\nThe California DMV later ordered Cruise to remove all of its cars from state roads, warning that they present a risk to the public. Cruise also suspended all vehicle operations and announced a recall of 950 of its robotaxis.\\n\\n4. Foxconn EV start-up sees shares slip in debut\\n\\nShares in major Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn\\'s electric vehicle unit fell in their debut trading day in Taipei on Monday, weighed down by concerns over the outlook for the highly competitive EV market.\\n\\nFoxtron Vehicle Technologies ended the day down by 2.7%, paring back some losses following a drop of as much as 9%, giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $2.7 billion. It raised T$7.5B ($1 = 31.7350 Taiwan dollars) in its initial public offering.\\n\\nFoxtron, a joint venture between iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn and carmaker Yulon, currently faces a host of challenges, including pricing pressures and supply chain constraints.\\n\\nChairman Young Liu, however, stressed that Foxtron still has a clear growth plan. The group has said it has received over 9,000 orders for its Model C vehicle, and expects to carry out deliveries by the end of June next year.\\n\\n5. Oil rises on output cut hopes\\n\\nOil prices rose Monday, extending recent gains following reports that a group of major producers may discuss deeper output cuts when they meet later this month.\\n\\nBy 05:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $76.52 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.7% to $81.13 per barrel.\\n\\nOil prices have dropped by almost 20% since late September on demand growth fears as well as easing worries of Middle East supply disruption amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.\\n\\nHowever, crude gained 4% on Friday and continued to rise Monday after Reuters reported, citing sources, that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, is set to consider whether to make additional oil supply cuts to shore up prices when it meets on Nov. 26.\\n\\nThe group, particularly major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, has already pledged total oil output cuts of 5.16 million barrels per day, or about 5% of daily global demand, in a series of steps that started in late 2022.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nMicrosoft hires Sam Altman, Cruise CEO resigns - what\\'s moving markets\\n\\nGermany heading for another poor quarter, \"arduous\" recovery: Bundesbank\\n\\nIMF and China support Argentina\\'s new president amid economic woes', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-hires-sam-altman-cruise-051226462.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'LOW.US', 'MSFT.US', 'NVD.F', 'NVD.XETRA', 'NVDA.MX', 'NVDA.US', 'NVDC34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.595, 'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.075}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nMatthew DiLallo\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nMatthew DiLallo\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/o/overweight-stock/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nNicholas Rossolillo\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nNicholas Rossolillo\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/s/secular-trend/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nMatthew Frankel, CFP®\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nMatthew Frankel, CFP®\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/bank-stocks/bank-stocks-during-recession/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nMatthew Frankel, CFP®\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nMatthew Frankel, CFP®\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/d/discounted-cash-flow-model/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nMatthew Frankel, CFP®\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nMatthew Frankel, CFP®\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/b/beta/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'TSLA.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nAnders Bylund\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nAnders Bylund\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiscal-quarter/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'COST.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nAnders Bylund\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nAnders Bylund\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/s/smart-home/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nMatthew DiLallo\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'content': '\\nMatthew DiLallo\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 20, 2023\\n', 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/terms/h/hedging/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-19T19:30:42+00:00', 'title': '12 Big Investment Trends in 2023', 'content': 'In this article, we will take a look at the 12 big investment trends in 2023. To see more investment themes of this year, click 5 Big Investment Trends in 2023.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs published its 2024 US economic outlook report on November 12 and said that the “heaviest blows” from fiscal policy tightening are behind us. Goldman Sachs said the US GDP growth in 2023 despite the difficult odds was surprising. It believes the Fed’s 2% inflation target is now well in sight. In light of this Goldman Sachs believes there’s only a 15% probability of recession over the next 12 months. Goldman Sachs thinks Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation could fall to 2.4% by December 2024 as it expects continuous disinflation throughout the year.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs also outlined its expectations around expected rate cuts from the Fed next year:\\n\\n“We expect the FOMC to deliver its first rate cut in 2024Q4 once core PCE inflation falls below 2.5%. We then expect one 25bp cut per quarter until 2026Q2, when the fed funds rate would reach 3.5-3.75%. While we see rate cuts next year as optional in that they are not necessary to avoid recession, we expect the FOMC to conclude that while neutral might not be as low as the 2.5% median longer run dot, it probably is not as high as 5.25-5.5%, so some amount of normalization makes sense as inflation falls. We think this rationale is enough to cut to 3.5-3.75% but probably not further. Our forecast could be thought of as a compromise between Fed officials who see little reason to keep the funds rate high once the inflation problem is solved and those who see little reason to stimulate an already-strong economy.”\\n\\nFor this article we scoured online investment forums, including Reddit\\'s investing communities, investment reports about 2023 themes of the stock market, read and watched expert interviews and surveyed mainstream financial media to gauge the biggest investment trends of this year. Big Investment Trends in 2023\\n\\nPhoto by Product School on Unsplash\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBig Investment Trends in 2023\\n\\n12. Investing in Emerging Markets\\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets became popular in 2023 as investors seek to hedge against the uncertainties in the US markets. Earlier this year, about 61% of the 234 money managers who took part in a Bloomberg survey had said that they plan to increase their exposure to emerging markets.\\n\\n“Economies in the developing world are far more resilient places today than they were 30 years ago, and EM central banks have been largely more responsible in dealing with the rise in inflation than the developed world has been,” said Justin Leverenz from Invesco Developing Markets Fund, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nMany investors are looking beyond major American stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) and finding small companies in emerging markets to invest in.\\n\\n11. Investing in Sectors That Will Gain from Aging Population\\n\\nBlackRock in its mid-year outlook 2023 report had highlighted aging population as one of the most important trends in the world. Aging population is having multiple effects in the investing world and it’s also impacting the healthcare and consumer industry. BlackRock said that the increase in aging population in the US and UK could result in permanently high interest rates due to distortions in demand and supply dynamics.\\n\\n10. Popularity of Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube Among Retail Investors\\n\\nAccording to a report on 2023 investment trends by market research firm Mintel, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube remain the top platforms used by retail investors for investing-related education and decision making. The report said that while many use Reddit’s investment-related subreddits, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube beat Reddit.\\n\\nThat social media has become a go-to place for retail investors to find out which stocks to buy or sell is not a secret. The pandemic days highlighted the huge importance of social platforms, especially Reddit, in the investing world. Major hedge funds had to give in to the power of social media investors, while companies like GameStop and AMC enjoyed huge stock jumps driven by Reddit-based communities. Investors are using these platforms to find small-cap growth stocks as they look beyond already mature stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\\n\\n9. Investing in Defense Stocks\\n\\nGeopolitical tensions are on the rise in the world. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had already put defense stocks in the spotlight. But in October, amid the launch of a brutal conflict between Israel and Hamas, defense stocks gained even more. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF jumped 7% since October 7 through October 18. Analysts believe the war in Ukraine and Israel’s intention to expand its war against Hamas, along with the possible entry of Iran and Lebanon into the war, could bring in more money for defense contractors.\\n\\nSome major defense stocks investors are currently watching include AeroVironment, Kratos Defense, Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), L3Harris (LHX), RTX (RTX), General Dynamics (GD) and BAE Systems (BAESY).\\n\\nIn its Q3 earnings call, Lockheed Martin’s management talked about its future expectations with a special focus on orders it’s receiving from Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine, among other customers:\\n\\n\"Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17.\\n\\nAt that point, one of the following could occur. FY ’24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY ’24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process.\\n\\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\\n\\n8. Crypto\\n\\nCrypto was a major investment trend in 2023 as digital currencies rose from their ashes despite major headwinds and setbacks. Crypto jumped a long with growth and tech stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). In June 2023, Bitcoin reached its highest level since June 2022. Bitcoin was up by almost 90% since the start of 2023.\\n\\nAs a result of these positive trends crypto companies saw a strong third quarter. For example, Coinbase’s revenue in the third quarter jumped by 14% to $674 million, much higher than the Street’s forecast of $654.7 million.\\n\\nDuring its Q3 earnings call, Coinbase talked about the rising popularity of crypto with some data and its future plans. The company said:\\n\\n\"American crypto holders are owed clarity and they are an increasingly expanding voter base. There are 52 million crypto holders in the United States. To put that into context, that’s more than the owners of electric vehicles and more than all collective members of U.S. Unions. The American people are embracing crypto as more Americans grow unhappy with the traditional financial system. Only 9% of those surveyed say that they are satisfied with the current U.S. financial system, and only 22% of people think that it’s better than any other countries and nearly two in five younger people that’s 38% say crypto and blockchain can increase economic opportunities for them in ways traditional finance can’t. To aid in the mission of driving for crypto regulation, Coinbase is a proud supporter of an independent movement known as Stand with Crypto that now has more than 100,000 advocates and continues to stand with the American people to drive towards clarity in the U.S. While the U.S. continues to struggle to keep pace, the rest of the world has made great strides in embracing crypto and Onchain technology with clear legislation.\\n\\nWe are seeing global efforts to bring crypto into regulatory scopes as 83% of the G20 nations are adopting crypto regulations. Most recently, we’ve seen this with MiCA legislation in Europe, and it’s incredibly encouraging to see that now 27 countries stand together with one unified set of rules for crypto, something the U.S. desperately needs. In response to this groundbreaking regulation, Coinbase moved quickly and recently announced that … [read the full earnings call transcript here]”\\n\\n7. Big Tech Stocks\\n\\nThe rise of the “Magnificent Seven” – Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) – was one of the most noticeable trends in the investment world in 2023. Most of the S&P 500 gains came from these companies this year. A Bloomberg report in October said that Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), AAmazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) accounted for about a quarter of the S&P 500’s market cap. Many bears and skeptics say this concentration of gains is not a healthy investment trend and shows the broader market remains weak. For example, as of the end of October, the S&P 500 was up 10.69% in 2023. But remove the gains posted by the Magnificent Seven group and you are left with just a 0.03% gain for the S&P 500 index in the same period. Most of the gains reported by these major tech companies were due to the AI-driven rally which many call a bubble.\\n\\n6. Treasury Bills\\n\\nInvesting in T-Bills was one of the biggest investment trends in 2023, thanks again to uncertainty and rising interest rates. Investors bought a whopping $1 trillion of new notes in just three months through September 10, according to data from Bloomberg.\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Big Investment Trends in 2023.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n25 Most Racist States in America Ranked by Hate Crimes 25 Richest Criminals of All Time 25 Worst States for Human Trafficking in America\\n\\nDisclosure: None. 12 Big Investment Trends in 2023is originally published on Insider Monkey.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-big-investment-trends-2023-193042529.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'FB2A.F', 'FB2A.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.127}}, {'date': '2023-11-19T16:30:05+00:00', 'title': \"Why Warren Buffett's portfolio moves signal 'caution' for investors\", 'content': 'If you want to invest like Warren Buffett, look no further than his recent portfolio adjustments.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing and third-quarter results revealed something noteworthy: the famed investor is selling more assets than he is buying, and given his impressive track record, retail investors should take heed.\\n\\n“The message is be cautious… I think he sees trouble next year,” Portfolio Wealth President Lee Munson told Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nMunson added: “He doesn’t see any screaming deals… It’s hard to find good companies at a reasonable valuation.”\\n\\nSince January 1, Buffett has sold about $23.6 billion worth of equities after purchases, making him a net stock seller for the year.

The professor was testifying for Google in one of the most consequential antitrust trials in decades.\\n\\nThe cringe-inducing secret that spilled out in a Washington courtroom reverberated across Wall Street and Silicon Valley, prompting new speculation about how much Apple stands to lose if the government wins this trial and how much Google’s rivals stand to gain. Google\\'s top litigator John Schmidtlein departs federal court in September in Washington, D.C. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win McNamee via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe Justice Department is arguing in the trial that the contract making Google the default search engine on iPhones demonstrates how the search giant illegally stifles competition. Google has said that such contracts are normal in its industry.\\n\\nThe Justice Department is asking presiding federal district court Judge Amit Mehta for an order that would prohibit Google from continuing to engage in alleged anticompetitive practices. That could mean an eventual end to the partnership if the government prevails.\\n\\nA \\'big number\\'\\n\\nJust how much this agreement benefits Apple was a source of speculation for years. It’s clear from the revelation of this past week that it means billions annually.\\n\\nHow many billions exactly? Bernstein analysts have estimated $18 billion to 20 billion a year for Apple. The New York Times reported last month that figure was roughly $18 billion in 2021.\\n\\nIt’s a \"big number,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte. And if it’s compromised, that could have a \"double negative impact\" on the company’s stock price, he added.\\n\\nIf the number is still $20 billion, it might obliterate nearly 7% of Apple’s total revenue if the judge in the Google case decides to revise how such contracts work in the future, or if they\\'re permitted at all. In 2023 Apple\\'s revenue totaled $298 billion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe revenue Apple earns from its Google contract — known in the industry as an Information Services Agreement, or ISA — likely lands in a bucket of revenue Apple calls \"services,\" according to Forte and Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang.\\n\\nThat services bucket also includes Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple Music, AppleCare, and iCloud storage subscriptions. Apple’s services revenue for the 12 months ending Sept. 30 was $85 billion.\\n\\nApple has warned investors that its commercial relationships with technology companies — without mentioning any specific names — could be compromised by legal and regulatory scrutiny.\\n\\n\"Certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings,” the company said in its most recent annual report.\\n\\n\\'Double negative impact\\'\\n\\nThe risk the antitrust trial poses to Apple is significant, said Forte, the D.A. Davidson analyst, both because of the billions at stake and the high value that stockholders ascribe to the income stream.\\n\\n\"I think that this shines a light on a large and important revenue source for Apple,\" Forte said. \"If this revenue were to diminish meaningfully, then it could have a double negative impact to the extent that it\\'s been a multiple expander.\"\\n\\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai testified that the default placement agreements \"can make a difference\" and be \"very valuable.” Google and Alphabet Inc.

In a court filing, Google’s lawyers argued that further disclosure of the precise terms of its revenue-sharing agreement with Apple \"would unreasonably undermine Google’s competitive standing in relation to both competitors and other counterparties.\"\\n\\nHow the trial ends could open up new avenues for Google’s rivals, although it will be a while before the outcome is determined. The evidence phase of the trial ended this week and closing arguments are expected in May 2024.\\n\\nIf the DOJ prevails, separate court proceedings would be held to determine remedies for any antitrust violations. Appeals are also expected, which could take the case into 2025.\\n\\n\\'You are not given a choice\\'\\n\\nGoogle’s competitors made it clear during more than two months of testimony that the arrangement Google had with Apple was damaging to them.\\n\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said he tried unsuccessfully for years to work out a default engine deal with Apple for Microsoft’s Bing.\\n\\n“Everybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,” he said.

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and his firm, then take a look at Ken Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.\\n\\nKen Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. According to Insider Monkey's research, the firm had $62 billion in assets under management as of June 2023, making it the ninth biggest hedge fund in the world. During the third quarter of last year, Citadel had an investment portfolio that was worth $466 billion which reflects the combined value of its direct investment positions such as shareholdings and the notional value of its put and call options along with other similar investments.\\n\\n2023 started off on a strong note for Citadel as it became one of the best performing hedge funds in 2022 after the 2022 market turmoil. This turmoil saw major selloffs in the technology segment, and it led to some hedge funds bleeding billions of dollars in losses. In fact, we took a look at 2022 hedge fund performance as part of our coverage of the 15 Best Hedge Funds to Work For to rank the funds by the total gains that they had made since their inception and in 2022. This revealed that as a whole, the hedge fund industry had lost $208 billion in 2022, with Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global faring off particularly worse as it accounted for 9% of the total losses. However, Mr. Griffin's hedge fund was the best performing hedge fund in 2022 as it posted $16 billion in gains during 2022.\\n\\nWith 2023 now behind us, it's time to take an updated look at Citadel's fortunes. 2023 has been marked by consistent market volatility, as while the rise of AI pushed markets higher, uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's future interest rate policy continued to bring them down. This volatility not only affected stocks, which started off the second half of 2023 on a weaker note, but also the bond market which has seen yields soar to record highs multiple times throughout this year. How has Citadel fared among all this? Well, the first half of 2023 wasn't particularly fruitful for the firm at least if we analyze it from a purely growth based perspective. Data shows that between January and June 2023, Citadel's trading revenue dropped by 35% annually to sit at $2.73 billion in 2023. However, things had stabilized by September, with news reports showing that during the month, Citadel Investment's multi strategy long/short flagship fund Wellington posted 1.7% in gains during the month to bring its year to date gains to 12.3%. At the time, this had beaten the S&P 500 which was up by 11%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTherefore, Citadel's third quarter investment portfolio is particularly important to watch as the firm has nevertheless kept up with its 2022 performance to an extent through the Wellington fund's September performance. During the quarter, the firm was busy buying stocks as it added significant new positions to its portfolio and increased the weightage of dozens of its old stakes as well. Some of Ken Griffin's latest stock picks during the third quarter include bets on the healthcare sector via investments in Iterum Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ:ITRM) and Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGLE); stakes in marine shipping through a half a million dollar stake in Euroseas Ltd. (NASDAQ:ESEA); and new positions in a multitude of exchange traded funds as well as a sizeable increase of its position in the U.S. automotive semiconductor firm indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI).\\n\\nShifting gears to take a brief look at today's stock market environment, stocks are considerably better these days after the inflation print for October missed estimates by 0.1%. Additionally, there might be further inflation drops in the not so distant future, as the U.S. Producer Price Index for October 2023 posted a 0.5% monthly drop which was its biggest drop in more than three years. This solidifies the prevailing narrative in the market that the Fed should be finished with its interest rate hiking cycle, but it also beckons a recession as a slow job market and declining fuel and producer prices are some of the earliest signs of an economic downturn.\\n\\nAs for Ken Griffin, he believes that a recession can take place in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2024. In a recent chat with Bloomberg, Griffin shared:\\n\\nSo here's our best guess. Our best guess was sometime late this year. It's November, so we're going to be wrong on that guess. Q2 right now is roughly the center point of our distribution as to when we're likely to see the United States in a recessionary environment. And I think there's a couple of really important questions that will come into bear at that moment in time that should influence one's view as to how deep this recession is going to be. Number 1 is what's going to happen to the fiscal policy of the United States. For choice, we think next year fiscal policy will not tighten that much. We're heading into a presidential election. It's really hard for politicians on either side of the aisle. What we need to do, which is to reign in our deficit spending in front of a presidential election. It's just going to be really hard politically to get there next year on that front.\\n\\nThe second real question next year is how much will companies start to unwind the labor hoarding that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been really hard to hire people. And as such large companies have been really reticent to let people go no matter what the circumstances are. So even if margins are contracting, even if you have gains from automation, people have been very reticent to let people go. Now we're starting to see for the first time that unwinding of that labor hoarding. What we don't know is how much of that labor hoarding as taken place.\\n\\nWith this backdrop, let's take a look at some of Ken Griffin's latest stock picks. The top three are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Should You?', 'content': 'If there’s one area of the market that billionaire Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates knows inside and out, it’s the technology sector. So, it caught my eye when Gates added a new tech ETF to the Trust’s portfolio, according to the 13F filings that just came out. According to the filing, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust purchased the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) during the third quarter.\\n\\nI’m bullish on IYW based on its compelling track record of long-term performance and its comprehensive portfolio of top U.S. tech companies.\\n\\nBill Gates, The Investor\\n\\nBill Gates is best known as the founder of Microsoft. He is also one of the richest people in the world. Bloomberg estimates that Gates has a net worth of over $130 billion.\\n\\nWhat’s less known is the fact that Gates is also an avid investor through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which has a portfolio value of approximately $38 billion.\\n\\nGates has a close relationship with Warren Buffett, who is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest investors of all time, if not the greatest, so Gates has learned from the best. Warren Buffett is a trustee for the Foundation, and the two frequently play “bridge” (a card game) together to stay sharp. Furthermore, about 20% of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s portfolio is invested in Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B).\\n\\nThanks to 13F filings, we get a snapshot of what investors like Gates are doing with their portfolios once a quarter. Institutional investors with over $100 million in assets under management must file a 13F within 45 days of the end of the previous quarter. Many investors look forward to the release of these 13Fs, as they provide some insight into what moves the “smart money” is making.\\n\\nIn its most recent 13F, we can see that Gates added a bevy of new tech stocks to the portfolio, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), as well as the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. To be clear, this isn’t a huge position for Gates. According to the filing, he owns about $6 million worth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut its inclusion is notable, nevertheless, as it is one of the few ETFs Gates owns, and he clearly has his finger on the pulse of the tech sector.\\xa0Therefore, let’s take a closer look at this tech-oriented ETF that caught Gates’ eye.\\n\\nWhat is the IYW ETF’s Strategy?\\n\\niShares says that IYW “seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.” It gives investors “exposure to U.S. electronics, computer software and hardware, and informational technology companies.”\\n\\nThe fund was launched in 2000 and now has $12.6 billion in assets under management.\\n\\nIYW’s Portfolio\\n\\nIYW’s portfolio is a comprehensive collection of the U.S.’s top technology companies. Altogether, the ETF owns 134 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 64.2% of the fund. Below, you can check out an overview of IYW’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\\n\\nThe list of holdings reads like a roll call of the U.S.’s best and brightest tech companies. Apple is the fund’s largest holding, followed by Microsoft, which Gates should know well. Other top holdings unsurprisingly include additional FAANG names like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), as well as leading semiconductor names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\\n\\nCollectively, IYW’s top holdings feature an impressive collection of Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Impressively, each and every one of IYW’s top 10 holdings features an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 8 or above.\\n\\nAlphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom all boast ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores.\\xa0IYW itself features an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\\n\\nLong-Term Excellence\\n\\nIn addition to this strong portfolio, IYW has been a great performer for a long time. IYW is up an incredible 49.5% over the past year as tech stocks have surged. Over the past three years, it has returned a very respectable 12.8% on an annualized basis (as of October 31).\\n\\nLooking further out, IYW’s returns are excellent. Over the past five years, it has provided investors with an annualized return of 19.2%, and over the past decade, it has returned 18.6% on an annualized basis.\\n\\nLooking at it another way, on a cumulative basis, an investor who put $10,000 into IYW 10 years ago would have nearly $46,000 today.\\n\\nExpense Ratio\\n\\nIYW’s expense ratio of 0.40% isn’t great, but it’s not exorbitant either. An investor putting $10,000 into the fund would pay $40 in fees during year one. Assuming that the expense ratio remains at 0.40% and that the fund returns 5% per year going forward, this investor would pay $505 in fees over the course of a 10-year investment in the fund.\\n\\nOn the one hand, there are plenty of tech-centric ETFs, such as the various ARK ETFs, that charge much more than this. But on the other hand, there are other large tech ETFs, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), with cheaper expense ratios.\\n\\nIs IYW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nTurning to Wall Street, IYW earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 112 Buys, 23 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $126.16 implies 9.55% upside potential.\\n\\nGates Could be on to Something\\n\\nWe don’t know exactly why Gates added IYW to his portfolio during the past quarter. However, the ETF’s highly-rated portfolio of top U.S. technology stocks and its stellar long-term track record are good reasons to consider investing in it.\\n\\nGates certainly has a good overview of what is going on in the U.S. tech sector, and he clearly feels that there is still plenty of opportunity in these types of stocks. This ETF is a convenient and effective way to invest in all of them. The only downside of IYW is that its expense ratio is a bit higher than some of its peers. Nevertheless, with the type of long-term performance it has put up, it’s unlikely that many investors are complaining about the 0.40% expense ratio.\\n\\nDisclosure', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iyw-bill-gates-bought-tech-234034670.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'ADBE.US', 'AMD.US', 'AMZN.US', 'AVGO.US', 'BRK-B.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'META.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA', 'NVDA.US', 'QQQ.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.12}}, {'date': '2023-11-18T22:19:31+00:00', 'title': 'Silicon Valley leaders\\xa0are calling Sam Altman’s firing the biggest tech scandal since Apple fired Steve Jobs—but the leading theory about the drama at OpenAI tells a different story', 'content': 'Apple lost its founder, 30-year-old Steve Jobs, in 1985, a famous moment in tech and business history, as the maker of the Macintosh parted ways with the face of personal computing, over a decade before their fateful reunion, the iPod, the iPhone, the $1 trillion valuation and all that. Now AI has its own \"Steve Jobs: Act One\" moment, as Sam Altman, the 38-year-old face of the AI boom, has been fired by OpenAI’s board for the unexplained sin of being “not consistently candid in his communications.\" Act Two is sure to follow, but, just like Jobs’ expulsion from the company he cofounded nearly four decades ago, the exact reasons for the firing are still shrouded in mystery.\\n\\nTech watchers are drawing the comparison. “What happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs,” legendary angel investor Ron Conwayposted on X late on Friday. “It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI,” Conway said.\\n\\nBloomberg writer Ashlee Vance made the same comparison, posting: “This is like Apple firing Steve Jobs only they\\'re doing it after the iPhone has become the best selling computer in history.”\\n\\nA day after Altman’s sudden dismissal, it remains a mystery why the most important company in the AI-driven “fourth industrial revolution” abruptly dismissed its superstar CEO. Altman, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 after running the prestigious tech incubator Y Combinator, has presided over the startup as its ChatGPT bot surged to popularity. Unusually for a tech founder, Altman had no equity stake in OpenAI and so didn’t exercise the type of control other founders like Mark Zuckerberg are known to do; unlike other tech leaders, Altman’s fame came not from his engineering brilliance but from his ability to raise large amounts of money and his bets on ambitious, world-changing technology.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThere are undeniable parallels with the Steve Jobs story. Jobs founded Apple in 1976 with Steve Wozniak when Jobs was just 21. Four years later, Jobs was worth $200 million; the following year, he made the cover of Time.\\n\\nBy the time he was 30, Jobs was running Apple as co-CEO alongside John Sculley, whom he had recruited from a marketing role at Pepsi. But Jobs’ hard-charging personality and zeal for perfection clashed with Sculley and Apple’s board members. Jobs was “uncontrollable,” according to one early Apple board member; Scully, in a later memoir, excoriated Jobs as “a zealot, his vision so pure that he couldn’t accommodate that vision to the imperfections of the world.”\\n\\nThe tensions came to a head in 1985 after sales of two Apple products — the Lisa and the Macintosh — failed expectations and Sculley and Jobs brought their differences to the board. The board sided with Sculley, and Jobs immediately quit (depending on whom you ask—others say he was fired). That same day, Jobs filed incorporation papers for Next Computing, which he would run for the following decade. Apple bought the company in 1997, setting the stage for Jobs’ triumphant return 12 years to the day after his ouster.\\n\\nThe exact cause of the messy Altman/OpenAI divorce is still unclear, but one leading early theory points to tensions related to OpenAI\\'s nonprofit origins and its current status as one of the powerful tech companies in the world — a strain that overlaps with a broader AI industry schism between \"accelerationists” and the “doomers.”\\n\\nThe fateful Friday afternoon\\n\\nSpeculation is rife over the reason for Altman’s surprise firing on Friday and the subsequent resignation of President Greg Brockman a few hours later.\\n\\n“Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,” Brockman posted on X. According to Brockman, OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever asked Altman to join a video meeting with the board at noon on Friday, where they informed Altman he was being fired. Brockman, who was not part of the meeting, was stripped of his chairman title as part of the leadership overhaul, but the board planned to keep him on staff, according to OpenAI’s statement. Since then, three senior scientists have resigned from the company, Ars Technica reports.\\n\\nWith the departure of Altman and Brockman, Sutskever is the only one of the company’s founders who remains at OpenAI. (Another co-founder, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, stepped back in 2018, citing a conflict of interest between OpenAI and Tesla’s autonomous ambitions, though some reports say it was due to a power struggle.)\\n\\nOpenAI\\'s board of directors includes Sutskever; Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo; Tasha McCauley , a tech entrepreneur and adjunct senior management scientist at the RAND Corporation, and Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. (Three other board members—Texas congressman Will Hurd, Neuralink director Shivon Zilis, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman—stepped down earlier this year.)\\n\\nFrom do-gooder startup to tech juggernaut\\n\\nAs The New York Times put it at OpenAI’s formation in 2015, OpenAI was explicitly set up as a nonprofit artificial-intelligence research center, with the specific goal of developing a “digital intelligence” to benefit humanity. Fast forward eight years to early 2023, and ChatGPT was exploding into the mainstream consciousness, becoming the most quickly adopted technology in history after its late 2022 launch and sending a shock through a Wall Street weathering the first bear market in decades. OpenAI’s big-bang moment was its announcement of a $10 billion investment from Microsoft in January, a huge payday that elevated Altman as the face of AI and instantly upstaged incumbent AI powers like Google and its DeepMind subsidiary subsidiary. AI’s benefits to humanity quickly became the big debate point.\\n\\nOn one side, there are so-called accelerationists, who see the productivity gains from this near-magical tech breakthrough as the next leap forward for capitalism. Top tech analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities dubbed it “the fourth industrial revolution” and compared it to the mid-1990s dotcom boom, rather than the late ‘90s busted bubble. MIT’s Erik Byrnjolfsson, an economist specialized in tech and its impact on productivity, sees work getting twice as efficient in the next decade due to AI. The venture capital community in Silicon Valley has enthusiastically backed this argument, with SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son moved to tears as he described AI giving birth to a “superhuman,” and Marc Andreessen writing an eccentric, much-criticized “techno-optimist manifesto.”\\n\\nOn the other end of the philosophical spectrum are the “doomers.” For the doomers, all the rosy predictions of AI utopia are inextricable from the reverse: that AI has the Terminator-like potential to rebel against its maker and poses an existential risk to humanity. (There is also the semi-doomer complaint that the tech will displace millions of workers from their jobs and fuel even greater disinformation and media disintegration.) Foremost among the doomers, perhaps surprisingly, is OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk. He famously quit the nonprofit because he believed it was straying too far from its original mission, and has repeatedlywarned that the technology is fundamentally dangerous to humanity.\\n\\nAnd you don\\'t need to be an alarmist doomsayer to be concerned about the risks of AI. For all of ChatGPT’s explosive success, its tendency to “hallucinate” answers when prompted (i.e., repeat false information) has never gone away. In fact, “hallucinate” was the word of the year in the Cambridge Dictionary.\\n\\nAs more details emerge the OpenAI drama from investors, employees, and other parties, the philosophical divide within the organization looks like an important aspect of what led to Altman\\'s ejection. A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg that Altman and the board clashed over the pace of development, the method of commercializing products and how to lessen potential harms. The New York Times’ Kevin Roose reported hearing from several current and former OpenAI employees that Altman and Brockman “could be too aggressive when it came to starting new products.” Kara Swisher has sources saying things to similar effect.\\n\\nAnd OpenAI\\'s corporate structure is based upon the doomer-friendly philosophy: The company retains the nonprofit’s mission and board, which oversees a capped-profit subsidiary, established in 2019. OpenAI’s directors are not bound to Milton Friedman-style shareholder theory, but rather to create “safe AGI (artificial general intelligence) that is broadly beneficial.” If Altman was ejected in a boardroom coup, as some have described it, the board\\'s putative mission and mindset is probably relevant to the events.\\n\\nAltman, who was totally blindsided by his firing, having represented OpenAI publicly at the APEC summit earlier this week in San Francisco, with President Joe Biden, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Google’s Sundar Pichai, has been talking up OpenAI’s commercial possibilities of late. At APEC, Altman said he was “super excited” about AI, “the greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we’ve had so far.” While saying he understood the concerns of doomers, name-checking the historian and public intellectual Yuval Harari, Altman nonetheless confirmed himself in the accelerationist camp, comparing AI to “the Star Trek computer I was always promised and didn’t expect to happen.”\\n\\nSo it’s possible that Altman was fired by the equivalent of idealistic nonprofit directors, who may have thought he was straying too far from OpenAI’s “beneficial” mission. If that turns out to be the case, similarities between Apple and OpenAI aside, AI’s “Steve Jobs moment” augurs an altogether stranger next chapter to be written in Silicon Valley history.\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-leaders-calling-sam-221931095.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.994, 'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.088}}, {'date': '2023-11-18T21:07:37+00:00', 'title': 'Bill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update', 'content': \"In this piece, we will take a look at Bill Gates' latest investment portfolio and its November 2023 update. If you want to skip our introduction to the technology billionaire and how his investments are shaping the world as we know today, then take a look at Bill Gates Portfolio: November 2023 Update - Top 5 Stocks.\\n\\nBill Gates' fame and money come via having caught on to the personal computing industry when the sector was in its infancy. His company, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. At the root of Microsoft's success is the world changing computer science industry, which has managed to put a computer, in one form or the other, in the hands of millions of people worldwide.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Gates has moved away from his trillion dollar firm, 2023 has been a year shaped by his decisions. This applies to both the stock market and the broader technology scene. Mr. Gates and his relationship with OpenAI have contributed to the rise of the world's most heavily trained artificial intelligence model ChatGPT. In turn, ChatGPT's progress has injected fervor into technology stocks, which needed a pick me up after the devastation to the market ushered in 2022 through the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the monetary policy effects of the coronavirus era.\\n\\nAccording to the latest estimates, Bill Gates is currently worth $116 billion as of November 2023. Most of his wealth comes through his Microsoft shares, both indirectly and directly. Mr. Gates' capital is also held up in the investment firm Cascade Investment L.L.C., a private investment firm headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. Billionaires like Bill Gates don't just simply invest in companies or organizations through the money in their personally held bank accounts. Instead, they structure their investments through companies for several benefits. Cascade is closely related to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the two organizations share Cascade's chief investment officer Michael Larson.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLike the Bill Gates Foundation, Cascade also files with the SEC. Its latest filing came in July 2023 and revealed that the firm had owned 9.8 million shares of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN). The shares opened at $157 on July 28th, implying that Bill Gates' investment in the Floridian car retailer was worth approximately $1.5 billion as of the time of the filing. Since the holding was disclosed, the stock has dipped and the shares are currently trading for $131.97. Another investment of the financial firm, often also called Bill Gates' family office, is the Western Asset Inflation-Linked Income Fund (NYSE:WIA). This fund invests primarily in inflation linked securities issued by the U.S. Treasury Department.\\n\\nShifting our focus back on the technology industry, OpenAI and ChatGPT have proven to be the biggest disruptors of the AI chatbot space. In their wake, there are numerous AI chatbot models that are now available for the public to use. Two of the most widely known AI platforms are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Bard and Elon Musk's xAI's Grok. At the same time, the potential offered by AI is not limited only to productivity tools. A significant chunk of the broader investor and corporate interest in AI - evidenced by the surge in technology and semiconductor stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - is represented by machine learning and its transformational potential for industries.\\n\\nBill Gates is still at the center of all the hype surrounding AI, as his and other investments allowed OpenAI to demonstrate that after training a model software such as ChatGPT on vast amounts of data, it is possible to let a model make advanced outputs that are above average human intelligence. However, when we talk about the third quarter, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made perhaps one of the biggest splashes in its recent history as it piled into stocks by the dozens as evidenced by its latest SEC filings.\\n\\nWhy is that? Well, the foundation's Q2 2023 SEC filings showed that it had made a total of 23 investments. Then, in the next quarter, these investments more than doubled as the Gates Foundation held 74 different investment stakes. In terms of their monetary value, the firm's Q2 investment portfolio was worth $42 billion and this slightly dropped to $38 billion by Q3 2023 end.\\n\\nToday we'll look at these considerable changes to the investment portfolio, with some of Bill Gates' latest investments being Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:IEF).

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries with the best economy in the world right now.\\n\\nGlobal progress suffered a massive hit when Covid-19 struck the world, reversing growth in most countries across the world. While 2021 saw a strong recovery, 2022 brought even more problems, as rising inflation and increase in interest rates impacted both spending and borrowing, and an economic downturn was witnessed, with expectations of many countries entering recession. While the economic performance since has alleviated fears of recessions in some major economies, economic slowdown has still proven to be a persistent issue.\\n\\nAccording to IMF\\'s World Economic Outlook Report in October 2023, the global economic growth rate for 2023 is expected to be 3%, down from 3.5% in 2022, while 2024 growth is expected to be slightly lower than even 2023, at 2.9%. This is well below the highs reported across the last decade before the pandemic struck, where average annual growth was around 3.9%. One of the reasons why global growth has declined so much is that advanced and developed economies, despite being some of the countries with the best economies in the world, have been hit the hardest, which make up a substantial percentage of total global GDP, and are expected to slide even further in 2023, going from 2.6% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 and just 1.4% in 2024. Fortunately, the decline in emerging markets, which are increasingly contributing more to the global GDP, is expected to be much less harsh, falling from 4.1% in 2022 to 4.0% in 2023 and 2o24. Amid the doom and gloom, there is a little ray of sunshine, as inflation is expected to decline to 6.8% in 2023 as opposed to 8.7% in 2022. 30 Countries with the Best Economy in the World Right Now\\n\\nJirsak/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOne of the primary reasons behind the global economic struggle is China\\'s slowdown. China has established itself as a major powerhouse and will easily be the biggest economy in the world by 2075. China attempted to completely wipe out Covid-19 from the country and engaged in a zero-Covid policy, because of which its economy opened up much later than most nations. However, even though it\\'s almost been a year since the country abandoned this policy, economic growth has remained stifled and considering its importance and influence on the global stage, China\\'s issues have had a negative impact on the global economy as well as the some of the countries with the best economies in the world, considering that China is a major partner for most of them. Even the Chinese yuan, which many have claimed could replace the dollar as the premier global currency, has slid consistently and is now at its lowest level in the last 15 years. Additionally, a real estate crisis has continued to spiral in China.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAgain, it is important to remember that despite this slowdown, things are looking better than initially anticipated. In Q3 2023, The U.S. delivered an incredible performance which saw its GDP growth rate go up to 4.9%, which albeit unsustainable, eased fears regarding a recession. Similarly, after a poor performance in 2022, which saw the U.S. stock market witness its worst first half in two decades, 2023 has been a stellar year, especially for tech companies. This performance isn\\'t just relevant for the U.S.; according to Vanguard\\'s FTSE All-World Index, profit of nearly 7% has been recorded for YTD October 2023, and includes several top stocks from some of the countries with the best economies in the world right now.\\n\\nTo ensure continuous progression and economic growth and prosperity, advancements needs to be made, and the tech sector has greatly influenced the global economy for many years. Even then, its importance, especially in the largest economies in the world in 2023, has continued to grow. Tech companies are also continuing to expand their footprint globally and \\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the most valuable company in the world and one of the biggest companies in the world by revenue, recently mentioned its increasing presence in India as an avenue for further growth, stating in its Q2 2023 earnings call \"Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record, grew very strong, double digits year-over-year. So it was quite a good quarter for us, taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It\\'s a major focus for us. I was just there, and the Dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we\\'ve been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online, and then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago, and they\\'re off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We\\'ve got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we\\'re partnering with, and we\\'re very happy with how that\\'s going overall. Overall, I couldn\\'t be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I\\'m seeing for the brand there. There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it\\'s great to be there.\" Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its share price increase by over 40% YTD 2023.\\n\\nAristotle Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2023 investor\\xa0letter:\\n\\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) contributed to outperformance in the third quarter, as a result of the underweight position relative to the benchmark. Following a very strong first-half performance, the stock saw a pullback ahead of the iPhone 15 launch, as investors weigh the potential growth from the new phone in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and slowing consumer spend.”\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nTo determine the countries with the best economy in the world right now, we first isolated the top 50 economies in the world based on GDP per capita. We then ranked these top economies in the world in 2023 by their latest GDP growth rate, using Q2 2023 where possible but adjusting to FY in case such data wasn\\'t available. This is why it was important to first isolate the nations with the highest GDP per capita, as the fastest growing countries in Asia, Latina America and Europe are developing economies, which herald a better future but isn\\'t enough to classify them among the countries with the best economy in the world right now. Also, it is important to remember that many of the richest economies contracted recently which is why even low growth rates made our list.\\n\\n30. Denmark\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.32%\\n\\nDenmark\\'s economy has been positively impacted by Wegovy, a weight-loss drug by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk, which made the company the most valuable company in Europe heading into 2024.\\n\\n29. Australia\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.36%\\n\\nWhile Australia is currently in a better position than expected by the IMF 6 months ago, its economic outlook is still somewhat bleak, and revised its growth forecast to just 1.2% in 2024, a historically poor performance if it happens.\\n\\n28.

Ireland\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.46%\\n\\nIreland has suffered the biggest contraction of any country in the Eurozone, falling by 1.8% as the risk of a recession for one of Europe\\'s most important economies starts to become likely.\\n\\n26. Singapore\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.50%\\n\\nAccording to the Fraser Institute, Singapore is now the freest economy in the world, and has overtaken Hong Kong for the accolade after more than half a century.\\n\\n25. France\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.53%\\n\\nThe Eurozone economy shrunk overall by 0.1% in Q3 2023, and is at a risk of entering a technical recession. However, inflation is easing in France, whose economy in Q3 2023 grew by only 0.1%.\\n\\n24. South Korea\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.61%\\n\\nSouth Korea has seen its economy remain steady amid a global economic slowdown, cementing its resilience. One of the key reasons behind this is improving exports, which is also good news for global trade.\\n\\n23. Israel\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.74%\\n\\nWhile Israel is currently among the best economies in the world right now, aided by billions of dollars from the U.S. in aid every year, the long-term impact of its war with Hamas and devastating attacks Palestinians remains to be seen. Currently, Israel\\'s economy is being fully tested as its biggest war with Hamas enters its second stage.\\n\\n22. Romania\\n\\nGDP Growth: 0.87%\\n\\nRomania\\'s economic growth, while still positive, is slowing down.

If you want to read about some more fighting games go directly to 5 Best Fighting Games of All Time.\\n\\nVideo games are one of the most popular sources for entertainment among children and adults alike. This represents a significant revenue opportunity for large companies as tech advances in virtual reality and artificial intelligence make it possible to make games more immersive and lifelike, as well as more profitable. Game developers are also exploring in depth storylines that merge gaming with other life experiences to create entire digital worlds which mimic real life. Some of the companies investing heavily in this area include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\\n\\nAccording to a report by professional services firm PwC, video games are capturing a large share of the consumer spending, advertising, and entertainment markets. The firm estimates that total gaming revenue is expected to rise from $227 billion in 2023 to $312 billion in 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 8%. Advertising revenue alone in this sector will essentially double in the next few years, reaching above $100 billion in 2025. Games are also becoming an increasingly important inspiration for hit films. Top streaming services like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and HBO Max have many game-inspired film titles in production.\\n\\nVideo games have also come a long way from being labeled antisocial and isolating. In fact, video games are now used to develop social connections. During the pandemic lockdown of 2020, video game sales skyrocketed as people described gaming as one of the ways of coping with mental health issues arising from lockdowns. PwC expects that video games will command nearly 11% of all entertainment revenue by 2027, up from just 6% in 2017. Fighting video games, the most popular genre within the video game world, are expected to lead this rally for the gaming world in the coming years.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThis growth in the popularity of fighting video games comes as a direct result of implementation of new tech like Blu-Ray, motion sensor technology, virtual reality, high-definition audio, and improved internet speeds into games. Even as gaming on personal computers and consoles recoils, the expansion in the mobile gaming sector will more than make up for any shortcomings. In the coming years, mobile gaming will account of more than half of the global gaming market across the world. The Asia-Pacific region, home to China, Japan, and Korea, is the biggest market for these mobile fighting video games.\\n\\nAdroit Market Research estimates that the global fighting games market with increase to more than $320 billion in size by 2028, exhibiting a growth rate of more than 11% between 2021 and 2028. Cloud gaming, mobile VR gaming, and smart device gaming are all taking off, helped by adoption of the latest tech by game developers and electronic manufacturing companies. Global content delivery networks like Netflix have also started focusing on this aspect of streaming. The introduction of streaming giants in the gaming world will have a net positive impact on game growth over the next few years.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley predicts that video gaming restrictions in China, put in place in 2021 to curb video game addiction among young adults, will wane in the coming months. As China approves new game titles and these hit play stores, a new gaming boom in the country may be on the horizon. The impact of inflation, wherein gaming is often cheaper than going out to eat or other outdoor activities, is also likely to have some impact on the gaming market around the world. Games may also be under threat from short form video content that is fast becoming the top source of entertainment for people globally.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nIn this article, we will list the 15 best fighting games of all time. We scoured the internet for the best fighting games of all time, looking through articles from prominent websites, Reddit threads, and gaming pages. After initial selection from these sources, sales figures for various games were compiled using a wide variety of sources and the 15 highest selling fighting games were selected from this list.

Prominent news publications, investor presentations from gaming firms, earnings calls from game publishers, and other such sources were used to compile the sales data. For further clarity, the original sources of the sales data are also mentioned. Video games which have a major fighting component, as well as other action or adventure themes, are considered as fighting games as many games feature a fighting theme that is based on larger backstories.  15 Best Fighting Games of All Time\\n\\nAdam Ziaja / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBest Fighting Games of All Time\\n\\n15.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to Mario Gabelli's Top 5 Stock Picks.\\n\\nThe stock market in the United States is full of investors looking to make a lot of money in a short space of time. This is primarily the main reason behind the incredible rise of growth stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), at the expense of more value-oriented entities. One person on Wall Street who still refuses to buy the growth mantra is Mario Gabelli, the billionaire chief of GAMCO Investors, a hedge fund with an equity portfolio worth over $8 billion.\\n\\nGabelli has had a career in the stock market that has spanned over five decades, starting back in 1977. Over the course of this time, he has stuck to the basics, investing in firms that are undervalued based on their fundamentals, and making a tidy profit by buying and selling their shares at the right time. Gabelli is old-school in that he likes to hold on to his stakes in these value entities over long periods, only shedding or loading up in miniscule amounts. This strategy has generated a quarter-on-quarter return of over 4% for his fund in the past two years.\\n\\nHis latest dealings in equities paint an interesting picture. Per latest 13F data, at the end of September 2023, the top ten holdings of his equity portfolio comprised around 15% of the portfolio. He has, on average, held on to his top ten holdings for more than nine quarters. These holdings are mostly in the industrial and consumer goods sectors. Between June and September, GAMCO Investors reduced holdings in 398 stocks, made new purchases in 41, sold out of 51, and made additional purchases in 205 stocks.\\n\\nIn a recent interview with PI Online, Gabelli outlined how technology, stock trading applications, and the advent of artificial intelligence have changed value investing, Per the veteran investor, even though the new tech was evolving the field of stock trading, it was still paramount that human beings and investors, with their experience and fact-checking instincts, be central to the whole process. Gabelli noted that he did not give too much credence to macro conditions when investing in a firm, firmly focusing on value for price instead.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“We think top-down all the time, but we don't invest that way. OK, will there be a recession? Will the Fed go to stay higher longer? Is inflation going to happen? What we want to understand is, is it a good company, with a good business, good management, and a reasonable price? So price is important to me. It's very hard for me to see a company with $800 billion market cap. How much can it grow over the next five years? I have been through these cycles. You basically have to take a practical dynamic. What is a business worth? And that's what we try to do.”\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nThese were picked from the investment portfolio of GAMCO Investors at the end of the third quarter of 2023. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the analyst ratings for the stocks are also mentioned.

Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:WTS)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\\n\\nWatts Water Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:WTS) makes and sells systems that manage and control the flow of fluids and energy. Latest filings, as of the end of September this year, show that GAMCO Investors is long on more than 538,000 shares in the firm worth $93 million, representing 1.07% of the portfolio.\\n\\nIn mid-September, investment advisory TD Cowen maintained a Market Perform rating on Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:WTS) stock and raised the price target to $165 from $160.\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $526 million in Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:WTS), compared to 21 the preceding quarter worth $499 million.\\n\\n8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 73\\n\\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provides payments and travel-related services. Latest filings show that GAMCO Investors is long on more than 653,000 shares in the firm worth $97 million, representing 1.12% of the portfolio, as of the end of September 2023.\\n\\nOn November 15, investment advisory Bank of America maintained a Buy rating on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock and lowered the price target to $198 from $200, noting that October operating metrics displayed higher net-write off rates but resilient loan growth.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) with 10.4 million shares worth more than $1.5 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Other detractors included American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), which fell on concerns over slower consumer spending and rising charge-offs, as well as wireless tower REIT American Tower, which was pressured by the increase in rates along with the broader real estate sector.”\\n\\n7. CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\\n\\nCNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) markets agricultural and farm machinery. In the filings for the third quarter of 2023, the fund detailed that it owned 8.7 million shares of the company worth $106 million, representing 1.23% of the portfolio.\\n\\nOn October 18, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) stock and lowered the price target to $16 from $17, noting that lower earnings could bring higher multiples for machinery stocks at present valuations.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Harris Associates is a leading shareholder in CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) with 123 million shares worth more than $1.5 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) (Italy), which designs, manufactures, and distributes agricultural and construction equipment, was the top detractor for the quarter. CNH Industrial’s share price fell following its second-quarter results, as agriculture equipment sales rose 5% in local currency, a slowdown from the prior quarter. This performance fell below market expectations due to destocking activity in Brazil and some production ramp-up issues for its new Patriot sprayer. We believe the production issues are temporary while the destocking actions will better position the business for the midterm. Pricing power remains quite strong and increased by roughly 7%, and precision agricultural sales grew by 21%. While the market was overly focused on near-term demand and sales growth, the agriculture equipment division produced its highest quarterly margin ever at 16.8%—an encouraging development that supports our view of the company’s long-term profitability. Further, the much smaller construction business delivered strong results, including its own quarterly margin record. Management maintained guidance for the rest of the company’s current fiscal year and indicated it expects to exceed the 2024 targets laid out at a capital markets day in 2022. We recently met with CEO Scott Wine at the company’s offices. He expressed confidence in the company’s ability to drive much better through-cycle financial performance while avoiding the company’s previous mistakes. He also believes the company’s share price is materially undervalued, and although he would prefer to invest in the business, he sees an opportunity to increase returns to shareholders via share repurchases. We believe CNH Industrial remains a solid business in an attractive industry that is run by a much-improved management team.”\\n\\n6. Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\\n\\nModine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) is a Wisconsin-based thermal management company founded in 1916.

If you want to skip our introduction to ETFs and the stock market in general, then take a look at the 5 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2023.\\n\\nThe stock market is full of all kinds of investment vehicles that can be used by professional and retail investors with different risk appetites. The most commonly discussed investment security is a stock, which is simply a representation of a company's equity and allows traders to make profits through share price appreciation or others to make money via other avenues such as dividends.\\n\\nHowever, investing in stocks is not for everyone. While buying the shares of well established companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is unlikely to lead to significant losses, when the investment horizon is broadened, then the process becomes more complex. Any coverage about stocks, such as this one, comes with a disclaimer that all investment decisions should be made after consulting a qualified professional and to good effect. Investing in stocks typically requires understanding the fundamental nature of a company's business as well as being cognizant of economic realities that can affect stock indexes as a whole.\\n\\nTo avoid the high research required for stock investments, one popular investment vehicle is an exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF is a collection of stocks that is typically compiled by professional financial services providers such as BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK). These are generally based either on industry sectors such as healthcare, energy, or technology, or stock and firm characteristics such as value stocks or growth stocks.\\n\\nWithin the ETF, there are two broad categories. These are actively managed ETFs and passively managed ETFs. As you might have guessed, actively managed ETFs have a portfolio manager in charge of regularly updating the fund. ETFs typically track a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500, and in an actively managed ETF, the portfolio manager is not constrained by the rules of the underlying index. For instance, the S&P 500 requires that any constituent firm must be profitable, and a fund manager can simply choose to ignore this if they feel that the restrictions are too tight and ignore other great stocks that can offer investors a return.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nETFs are so popular that even one of the greatest investors of our time, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, holds one in his investment portfolio. Insider Monkey scanned Berkshire's investments for the second quarter of 2023 and discovered that Mr. Buffett had invested $17.4 million in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the biggest ETFs in the world in terms of its net assets. Currently, these sit at $393 billion, and for those out of the loop, an ETFs net assets are the amount left over for investors after all its liabilities are subtracted from the assets. The ETF is part of the SPDR State Street Global Advisors fund family, and as the title suggests, it tracks the S&P 500 stock index managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI). Since its inception in 1993, the ETF has gained 902% in share price appreciation, which is in line with the corresponding value of 910% for the benchmark index over the same time period. However, the ETF is passively managed, so there's little benefit in investing in it apart from the ability to receive dividends (which is undoubtedly why Mr. Buffet has invested millions of dollars in it).\\n\\nShifting gears to focus on the current stock market environment, these days, the Federal Reserve is once again back under the spotlight. November has seen several stock indexes such as the NASDAQ and the S&P post multi-day returns as investors started to speculate that the Federal Reserve might be finished with its current interest rate hiking cycle. At the heart of the current stock market chatter is the Treasury market. Treasuries, or bonds, are debt securities and their prices drop if interest rates are rising. This makes their yield shoot up, and it also raises the costs of raising capital.\\n\\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's comments that he and his team are aware of high yields and their effect on borrowing costs along with the broader economic health were what spurred the latest stock market rally. At the same time, his later comments that further hikes might be warranted to fully control the beast that is inflation also took the air out of the rallies. Volatility in the Treasury market is measured by the ICE BofAML MOVE Index (^MOVE) index, and this index is currently seven points higher than its reading at the end of June 2023 and a little over ten points higher than a recent low of 96.61 in September.\\n\\nCombining all these factors, it's clear that the stock market is in no mood to be boring at the tail end of 2023. Money doesn't grow on trees, and the market is adamant that investors earn every dime of their winnings instead of just cruising along and watching their investments grow. This might also be the right time to see which stocks and ETFs have done well in 2023's turbulent environment. Therefore, we decided to dig out the best performing actively managed exchange traded funds in 2023, and the top performers are GraniteShares 1.5x Long META Daily ETF (NASDAQ:FBL), GraniteShares 1.5x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVDL), and Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (NASDAQ:BTF). Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2023\\n\\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo compile our list of 2023's best performing actively managed ETFs, we first made a list of all such ETFs and ranked them by their market capitalization. Then, their year to date gains were calculated, and the top performing actively managed ETFs in 2023 are as follows.\\n\\nBest Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2023\\n\\n10. Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSE:BLOK)\\n\\nYear to date returns: 46.03%\\n\\nAmplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSE:BLOK) is part of the Amplify ETFs fund family. It was set up in 2018 and has a net asset value of $427 million. It is an equity ETF, and the fund limits itself to investing primarily in companies that deal with blockchain technology. Stocks account for more than 90% of Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSE:BLOK)'s holdings, and its top three stock picks are MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), and Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. (TSE:GLXY.TO). Along with GraniteShares 1.5x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVDL), GraniteShares 1.5x Long META Daily ETF (NASDAQ:FBL), and Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (NASDAQ:BTF), it is one of the best performing actively managed ETFs in 2023.\\n\\n9.

The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) focuses on firms that are either headquartered in the U.S. or those that trade on U.S. stock exchanges. It limits its attention to investing in firms that rely on the Internet to deliver their products and services. The sectors that this ETF is primarily involved with include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain technologies.\\n\\n8.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock and it seeks to amplify the appreciation in Apple's share price. Apple's shares are up 40% year to date, making it unsurprising that GraniteShares 1.75x Long AAPL Daily ETF (NASDAQ:AAPB) has posted 70% in year to date returns.\\n\\n7. GraniteShares 1.25x Long Tsla Daily ETF (NASDAQ:TSL)\\n\\nYear to date returns: 80.34%\\n\\nGraniteShares 1.25x Long Tsla Daily ETF (NASDAQ:TSL) is an exchange traded fund similar to the GraniteShares 1.75x Long AAPL Daily ETF (NASDAQ:AAPB). The ETF has $5 million in net assets, and it was set up in 2022 - at the same time as its Apple counterpart. The fund tracks the shares of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), seeking to deliver 175% of the daily percentage change in the share price of the electric vehicle manufacturer.\\n\\n6.

This is, kind of, a big deal, you know. Making a big U-turn here on text messaging, making it easier for iPhone and those Android users to chat more seamlessly. You\\'re going to allow for us for stuff like read receipts, images, video to go in more seamlessly. You\\'re not going to have, sort of, the issues where people get kicked out of group chats and things like that.\\n\\nBut what\\'s not changing is the fact that if you\\'re iPhone you\\'re blue bubble, if you\\'re not you\\'re green. What do you guys think about that?\\n\\nJOSH SCHAFER: I think the that the top piece that\\'s on the graphic right now, text Android users over Wi-Fi is the biggest takeaway for me here. That\\'s what people love about iMessage, right? You don\\'t need to actually have cell service. You can go to say Europe and you can communicate with someone here by just being on Wi-Fi. And you don\\'t need to pay for the expensive plan or whatever. So to have that is advantageous for both sides. And I could see why Apple would want to do that.\\n\\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah and it\\'s a totally different messaging system, RCS versus SMS or MMS. So it makes those things much easier to do. And I know I\\'ve been frustrated before texting a non iPhone user. I don\\'t know if it\\'s sent. You know at least when the blue says delivered, the text has sent.\\n\\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.\\n\\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I got a question for both of you, guys.

I\\'d be like, oh, no, did the text not go through?\\n\\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, you\\'re like, oh, they gave me a fake number.\\n\\nALEXANDRA CANAL: And then maybe I\\'d risk--\\n\\nJOSH SCHAFER: They gave me a fake number.

His company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported a 40% rise in operating earnings in the third quarter. Berkshire Hathaway also reported a record $157.2 billion cash holding as of Sept. 30.\\n\\nThe majority of Buffett\\'s earnings came from his insurance business, with Geico reporting total underwriting earnings of over $1 billion in the last quarter. His equity holdings, however, declined in value over the past quarter.\\n\\nThe primary driver behind Berkshire Hathaway\\'s investment loss is its majority stake in tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple\\'s shares declined by over 11% in the third quarter, causing Buffett to incur an investment loss of over $24 billion during this period.\\n\\nWhile Buffett\\'s total investment portfolio might have been impacted due to because of declining share prices, he has benefitted from dividend payouts in the last quarter.\\n\\n\"The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,\" Berkshire Hathaway said in a news release reporting its operating results.\\n\\nDon’t Miss:\\n\\nThe 60/40 strategy isn\\'t going to cut it any longer, which is why major firms like Blackrock are adding these assets to their portfolios to boost returns. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.\\n\\nSome of his most reliable stock holdings include:\\n\\nCoca-Cola\\n\\nBuffett has credited The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) as his \"secret sauce\" for success, as it has been one of Berkshire Hathaway\\'s most profitable investments.\\n\\nThe beverage producer\\'s dividend payouts have padded Berkshire Hathaway\\'s bottom line. Buffett, who owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, received dividend payments of approximately $704 million as of 2022.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"All Charlie (Munger) and I were required to do was cash Coke\\'s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow,\" Buffett said in a shareholder letter.\\n\\nBuffett\\'s investment in Coca-Cola amounted to $25 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022, accounting for 5% of Berkshire Hathaway\\'s net worth as of last year.\\n\\nCoca-Cola is widely regarded as a popular dividend aristocrat, as the company has raised dividends consecutively over the past 61 years. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase & Co. have an Overweight rating on Coca-Cola stock. Morgan Stanley has a price target of $65, indicating a potential upside of over 13%. JP Morgan raised its price target to $62, which reflects an of over 8%.\\n\\nBank of America\\n\\nBank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) played an important role in stabilizing the U.S. banking system after the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and other bank runs. Buffett owns approximately 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America, accounting for 9.23% of his portfolio.\\n\\nThe Oracle of Omaha\\'s total investment in Bank of America is valued at over $30 billion, making it the second-largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway\\'s portfolio.\\n\\nAs the Federal Reserve gradually eases interest rate hikes, many analysts expect bond prices to recover in 2024, making banking stocks such as Bank of America generate substantial profits.\\n\\n\"He’s [Buffett] holding on to his Bank of America. It’s his second-largest position. Why is he doing that? Why isn’t he trimming that? Well, I’ll tell you why because next year, if we get the bond rally the way everybody expects, their net profit — their net interest margins are going to go up, and everybody’s going to be very happy,\" said Lee Munson, president and chief investment officer of Portfolio Wealth Advisors.\\n\\nNew York-based investment bank Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. holds an Outperform rating on Bank of America stock, with a price target of $51. This indicates a potential upside of over 72%. BMO Capital Markets has a Market Perform rating on the stock with a price target of $40, which reflects a potential upside of over 35%.\\n\\nOccidental Petroleum\\n\\nBuffett bought over 17 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) in the last quarter. He is a majority shareholder of Occidental with a more than 25% stake in the oil producer.\\n\\nOccidental Petroleum\\'s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint are expected to strengthen its foothold in the oil industry as countries push toward eliminating carbon emissions. Earlier this month, Occidental Petroleum partnered with BlackRock to invest in building the world\\'s largest direct air capture facility in Texas.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway expects to generate over $960 million in dividends from Occidental Petroleum. Buffett is slated to benefit from the rising stock price as well, as JPMorgan expects Occidental stock to hit $78, indicating a potential upside of nearly 30%.\\n\\nRead Next:\\n\\nMost investors are priced out of buying real estate in the highest-growth markets, but they can still get a piece of the action through this innovative strategy.

Despite these overhangs, early reports from the supply chain seem to indicate demand for the new phone is in line with or better than investor expectations.

Tech stocks are rallying once again. Despite a series of macroeconomic headwinds, traders have come rushing back to the tech sector. There’s been a particular focus on the largest companies out there, as the tech giants look like safe harbors right now. But that safety comes at a high price. For these three tech stocks to sell today, valuations have gotten far out of hand. Particularly in a world of higher interest rates, this isn’t the time to be overpaying for large-cap tech stocks such as these three.\\n\\nTech Stocks to Sell: AMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\\n\\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBears love to pick on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). That chip company has blasted off in 2023 thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) developments, but Skeptics claim it’s all a big bubble set to pop.\\n\\nThat may or may not be true. Time will tell. What is clear, however, is that Nvidia is making good of the AI opportunity while it lasts. Specifically, Nvidia grew revenues 101% year-over-year last quarter. It’s not Nvidia that is the real AI bubble stock, rather it’s AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nWhile Nvidia is doubling the size of its business thanks to AI innovations, AMD grew revenues a meager 4% last quarter. And it is barely profitable, bringing in a puny 18 cents per share of earnings last quarter.\\n\\nAMD is trying to keep investors excited with the possibilities of its own AI chips set to launch in coming months. But details have been scarce about who the main customers will be for these products. Long story short, Nvidia won the rush to the AI market and left AMD in the dust. Meanwhile, AMD stock is selling for about 45 times forward earnings, which is a rather lofty level. Consider adding it to your list of tech stocks to sell now.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\\n\\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nFor a while, it appeared Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was heading toward a much-needed reality check. But, the smartphone company has seen its shares surge back to near 52-week highs in recent days.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWith the recent rally, AAPL stock is now back to almost 30 times forward earnings. This for a company that is expected to grow revenues less than 4% in fiscal year 2024.\\n\\nThat valuation simply doesn’t make sense in a time when interest rates have gone up so dramatically. You need some pretty serious growth to justify 30 times earnings in today’s marketplace. Apple, by contrast, is a mature company that barely grows and could even see earnings decline in a recession or if issues develop with key overseas markets.\\n\\nApple has relied on share buybacks to juice EPS growth in recent years. But as the valuation goes up, the buyback becomes less effective in terms of reducing the share count. And Apple’s paltry 0.5% dividend yield isn’t enough to warrant holding AAPL stock at this time either. You might consider getting out before it’s too late.\\n\\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\\n\\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\\n\\nGraphics software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been on quite a run. Shares are up more than 80% over the past year, and nearly 1,000% over the past decade.\\n\\nAdobe has become a prime example of how a software company can evolve from selling one-time licenses to being a recurring subscription revenue powerhouse. By getting folks to pay for Adobe’s software offering every month, Adobe has made itself a far more attractive and predictable business.\\n\\nBut traders have gotten carried away. ADBE stock is currently going for more than 50 times trailing earnings. And I’m skeptical how fast the company will continue to grow as it is already a mature offering that has raised prices dramatically; Adobe has already harvested the easy pickings here. In addition, generative AI could disrupt Adobe’s business model in unforeseen ways. Adobe is a good company, but not a good investment at today’s prices. That’s why it’s among the tech stocks to sell now.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(AAPL) is a Trending Stock', 'content': \"Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\\n\\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\\n\\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\\n\\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\\n\\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\\n\\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $2.07 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.\\n\\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.\\n\\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\\n\\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\\n\\n12 Month EPS\\n\\nRevenue Growth Forecast\\n\\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\\n\\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $117.84 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $394.83 billion and $423.07 billion estimates indicate +3% and +7.2% changes, respectively.\\n\\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\\n\\nApple reported revenues of $89.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.29 a year ago.\\n\\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.57%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\\n\\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\\n\\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\\n\\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Microsoft and Amazon are both priced at more than 30 times profits and Apple is trading at 28.\\n\\nAlibaba Dives $22 Billion as Chip War Spurs Breakup Rethink\\n\\nStill, there are questions as to how sustainable the latest rally is.

Wall Street is anticipating a third-consecutive blow-out report thanks to strong demand for its chips used in AI computing. But there’s also a risk of disappointment given elevated expectations, with the stock closing at a record on Tuesday.\\n\\nInvestors will be looking to see how tightening US restrictions on chip exports affect Nvidia’s outlook, at a time when the escalating battle between the US and China prompted a sharp reversal of corporate strategy at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\\n\\n“The bar is very high,” Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a research note on Thursday. “We expect nothing short of another strong quarter for Nvidia, but think investors are already expecting this.”\\n\\nStill, Big Tech’s earnings growth is promising enough to quell investors’ doubts about valuations, said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. She singled out Nvidia, whose 200%-plus surge this year makes it the runaway top performer on the Nasdaq 100.\\n\\n“Maybe 40 times forward earnings on Nvidia — maybe that seems expensive,” she said. “But when you expand the chart, it is actually not off the chart, so to speak. Everything is relative.”\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nApplied Materials Inc., the largest US maker of chipmaking machinery, slid in late trading following a report that it faces a US criminal investigation for allegedly violating export restrictions to China. Apple Inc. has fallen further behind in its multibillion-dollar effort to make a modem chip for the iPhone, stymied by the complexity of replacing an intricate Qualcomm Inc. component. An escalating fight between the US and China for technological dominance has triggered one of the most stunning reversals of corporate strategy yet: On Thursday, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. walked back plans to spin off and list its $11 billion cloud business. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said he expects China to be “at the forefront” of artificial intelligence, and said it’s important for the US to collaborate with the Asian nation on both regulation and innovation. International Business Machines Corp. suspended its advertising on X, the social media platform formerly called Twitter, after the technology company’s ads were found by a watchdog group near pro-Nazi posts. OpenAI Inc.

They are getting hit from a lot of different places,\" said Todd Phillips, a professor at Georgia State University. \"So when a regulator basically says, we are going to start treating your competition a lot like the way we treat you, that is good news.\"\\n\\nU.S. oversight of Big Tech financial services is fragmented. Companies must apply to each state for money transmitter licenses, and are subject to oversight by various regulators.\\n\\nThe CFPB rule would toughen up supervision, requiring Big Tech to comply with its rules on privacy protections, executives\\' conduct and unfair and deceptive practices.\\n\\nSeventeen companies would be affected including Apple, Google, PayPal and Block\\'s CashApp, which together facilitated roughly $1.7 trillion worth of payments in 2021, the CFPB said. The value of all non-cash payments - excluding wire transfers primarily used for large transfers - was $128.51 trillion in 2021, Federal Reserve data shows.\\n\\nThe CFPB already supervises PayPal and CashApp under its international money transfer rules, but Apple and Google would be subject to CFPB oversight for the first time. Google declined to comment and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"Silicon Valley is already a major part of the financial marketplace,\" the CFPB said in a statement. Subjecting large tech companies in the payments market to similar oversight as banks will increase competition, the agency said.\\n\\nWhile tech giants rely on banks to process payments via bank-issued credit and debit cards, some - like Apple - charge lenders a fee for those transactions. The CFPB has also expressed concern that tech companies could be monetizing customer data and compromising user privacy.\\n\\nAccording to McKinsey research cited by the CFPB, big tech companies, by some measures, have surpassed regional and community banks in terms of consumer trust related to digital payments. Without regulatory scrutiny, they could leverage their growing dominance of consumer payments to capture other services like lending and card issuing, analysts said.\\n\\nWorried by this trend, the banking industry has been lobbying financial regulators to crack down on tech giants, arguing in public letters, blogs and congressional testimony that they are putting consumers\\' privacy at risk.\\n\\nThey called for the CFPB to invoke its authority under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to designate \"larger participants\" in the nonbank market for consumer financial products. Washington trade group the Bank Policy Institute is among those leading that campaign.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just not necessarily always clear to your average consumer what the differences are between a regulated and insured bank versus a totally unregulated tech company,\" said Paige Pidano Paridon, senior associate general counsel at BPI.\\n\\nBanks, for example, are required by law to disclose their information-sharing practices to their customers and face limits on what consumer data they can share with third parties.\\n\\n\\'LEG UP\\'\\n\\nRepresentatives for Big Tech have accused the CFPB of trying to protect traditional lenders.\\n\\nThe Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition whose partners include Apple and Google, said last week the proposal was \"more about giving Wall Street a leg up\" than protecting consumers. The CFPB did not address a query on that claim.\\n\\nChopra has also been critical of bank practices and has targeted the fees they charge consumers, among other measures.\\n\\nWhile Big Tech companies have deep pockets and plenty of resources to handle the new scrutiny, the rule could limit how they use and protect consumer data.\\n\\nLegal experts also said the CFPB clearly has the authority to regulate Big Tech\\'s payment businesses, suggesting the industry may not fight the proposal. The CFPB is accepting public feedback on the proposal until early 2024.\\n\\n\"From the perspective of large technology companies, you might even prefer to be supervised, because the agency is not going away,\" said John Coleman, a partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.\\n\\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Michelle Price and Richard Chang)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-us-consumer-watchdog-hands-110237700.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.993, 'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.096}}, {'date': '2023-11-17T11:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Six Documents That Explain DOJ’s Antitrust Case Against Google', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- The most damning evidence in the US antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc.’s Google that concluded in Washington this week came not from the parade of witnesses from Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other companies, but from internal documents.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nAston Martin Owner Lawrence Stroll Sells F1 Team Stake at £1 Billion Valuation Backlash Spreads Over Musk’s Endorsement of Antisemitic Post Hamas Mastermind Who Tricked Israel Is Top Target in Gaza Tunnels Apple Plans to Make It Easier to Text Between iPhones and Androids Xi’s Big Week Ends With Rare Wins on US Ties, Taiwan, Economy\\n\\nDuring the 10-week trial, the Justice Department used emails, slides and other records to illustrate how Google’s lavish payments to other companies ensured its search engine became the preselected option almost everywhere people access the internet.\\n\\nAntitrust enforcers allege that Google illegally maintained a monopoly over search, where it controls nearly 90% of online queries, through those payments to smartphone makers, web browsers and wireless carriers. That dominance allowed Google to raise prices on advertisers without consequences, they argue, and delay innovations and privacy features that consumers want when they search online.\\n\\nThe fate of the world’s fourth-largest company is now in the hands of US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who delayed closing arguments until May and likely won’t have a ruling for several months. If he finds Google violated antitrust law, another proceeding will determine remedies — including a possible breakup of the company.\\n\\nThe 10-week trial featured testimony from Apple executives, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. But major revelations came in the internal documents and emails, only a small portion of which have been made public.\\n\\nHere are six documents that best illustrate the Justice Department’s case:\\n\\n1) Google spends $26 billion to be the default\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGoogle pays other companies to set its search engine as the default by sharing a portion of the money it makes through advertising. The exact percentage differs between contracts and Google has maintained both the rate and amount it pays to particular companies is confidential.\\n\\nBeing the default search engine gives Google access to more data than its rivals, allowing it to improve its algorithms and results and making it even harder for competitors to attract users.\\n\\nMehta allowed the Justice Department to reveal how much the company has paid overall by year — in 2021, it paid $26.3 billion out of the $146.4 billion earned from search advertising, or roughly 18%. The number has increased since 2014, when it paid $7.1 billion of $46.8 billion it brought in via search advertising, or about 15%. The Justice Department alleges Google’s growing payments for its default status demonstrate how important they are to its continued dominance in search.\\n\\nFor comparison, the market capitalization of Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and 215 other companies in the S&P 500 Index are lower than Google’s 2021 default payments. According to the International Monetary Fund, 97 countries in the world including Haiti, Albania and Nicaragua also have a smaller gross domestic products than that.\\n\\nGoogle’s biggest payment every year is to Apple: Google’s CEO testified in a separate antitrust trial that the payment was “well over $10 billion” last year. Both Google and Apple have objected to revealing details about the agreement publicly, though a witness accidentally disclosed that the search giant pays out 36% of revenue made from search advertising on Macs, the iPhone and iPads.\\n\\nGoogle argues that the payments help support the Android ecosystem, which competes against Apple’s iPhone. And rivals like Microsoft have long paid for their products to be pre-installed and set as the default on computers.\\n\\n2) Google makes more than $100 billion from search ads\\n\\nGoogle’s search advertising – the text and shopping promotions that appear at the top of a results page in response to user queries – are the company’s most lucrative business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, executives testified at the trial, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020.\\n\\nMichael Roszak, a Google finance executive, prepared notes for a 2017 speech that the Justice Department alleges offers insight into how the company’s employees see competition. He wrote that search advertising is a lucrative business model only rivaled by criminal drug or contraband operations. Google has the luxury of being able to ignore demand pressures and focus on the supply side, or advertising revenue, he wrote.\\n\\nWitnesses from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Home Depot Inc., Expedia Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. testified at the trial about the importance of Google’s search ads to reach consumers. Several said the costs of their search ads on Google have ballooned in recent years as the company changed the rules for auctions used to set pricing. And they don’t have good alternatives to Google — the first place many people go to start looking for something online.\\n\\nGoogle argued that Roszak’s notes were only part of a training and don’t represent the company’s views. It also contests the idea that its search advertising is a “must-have,” arguing that it competes with Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok.\\n\\n3) Google’s most important default deal is with Apple\\n\\nGoogle first entered into a deal to be the default search engine in Apple’s Safari browser in 2002. Today that’s the most important of Google’s default deals, since it sets the search engine for the iPhone, the most-used smartphone in the US.\\n\\nThe most recent iteration – negotiated in 2016 between Pichai and Apple dealmaker Eddy Cue – includes a provision that the two would “support and defend” the pact against antitrust scrutiny.\\n\\nNotes from a 2018 meeting between Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook shown in court said of Google’s collaboration with Apple on search: “Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.” That line raises red flags for antitrust enforcers since Google and Apple are each other’s biggest rivals in the smartphone industry and should be competing.\\n\\nWhen he testified in late October, Google’s Pichai said he doesn’t recall making that statement and that the company fiercely competes with Apple even though they are partners on search.\\n\\n4) Being the default matters because most people don’t switch\\n\\nGoogle’s default position on a web browser or mobile phone discourages people from switching to rival search engines, the Justice Department alleges.\\n\\nAnd Google is very aware of the value of that key position. In 2007, Google chief economist Hal Varian called the default home page a “powerful strategic weapon in the search battle.” In 2014, Google determined that Android users “rarely stray away from pre-loaded apps.” And in 2015, Google described potentially losing the deal with Apple for it to remain the default search engine on Safari browsers as a “code red.”\\n\\nThe government’s main economic witness – Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Michael Whinston – calculated that Google’s agreements lock-up about 50% of the search queries made in the US. (That number doesn’t include another 20% of US searches made through Google’s Chrome browser, which has its search engine as the default.)\\n\\nUsing information on when people have shifted their defaults – such as when Apple dropped Google Maps as its default service on iPhones in favor of its own app – he calculated that about 33% of all US searches will always go to the default. That means a rival search engine could only ever hope to garner about 17% of US search traffic because of Google’s deals.\\n\\nGoogle’s economic expert Kevin Murphy contested this calculation, arguing that Whinston was wrong to use the Apple Maps example for his calculations. He also contested the idea that Google’s contracts lock-out competitors since companies like Microsoft and Yahoo could compete for the default themselves.\\n\\n5) “Google is magical” because user data fuels search\\n\\nSearch engines rely on users to improve their results. Eric Lehman, a 17-year Google veteran who worked on search ranking, gave presentations internally on how the company’s search engine works titled “Google is magical.”\\n\\nThe “key” to Google’s magic is the user information that flows back to the search engine, according to Lehman. “As people interact with search, their actions teach us about the world,” he wrote. “For example, a click might tell us that an image was better than a web result.”\\n\\nGoogle logs that information – not just what a user clicks on, but how far they scroll down a page or across a carousel, whether their mouse hovers over a specific result and some other details like the person’s location.\\n\\n“The source of Google’s magic is this two-way dialogue with users,” Lehman’s presentation concludes. “With every query, we give some knowledge and get a little back.”\\n\\nThe Justice Department argues that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively, enforcers say.\\n\\nGoogle rejects the idea that user data is necessary for a search engine today because of advances in technology. Lehman and other Google witnesses have testified that user interaction information is less crucial because of the improvements that can be gained from artificial intelligence and machine learning.\\n\\n6) Google told employees what not to say\\n\\nGoogle was founded in 1998, one month before the Justice Department’s famed antimonopoly trial against Microsoft. In part because of that, the company has long been concerned about antitrust scrutiny, so much so that the Justice Department alleges it taught employees to “Communicate with Care” – adding lawyers to email chains in order to shield discussions from government review and avoiding certain words in written communications.\\n\\nIn one company presentation, Google employees were instructed not to use terms like “crush,” “kill,” “hurt” or “block” when talking about rivals. They should also avoid “lock-in,” “market,” “bundle” or “tie.” And when discussing competitors, they should include a lot of them. “If you really need to list a group of competitors in a particular area, list as many as possible (or make clear that it’s a partial list). It’s just wrong to say that we’re dominant in or control any line of business.”\\n\\nThe Justice Department alleges that these actions may have hidden evidence that could have proven Google’s alleged antitrust violations.\\n\\nGoogle denies that it sought to hide evidence, saying that it legitimately encouraged employees to seek legal guidance on complex legal or regulatory issues. The communications guidelines sought to offer best practices for dealing with confidential or sensitive topics.\\n\\n--With assistance from Davey Alba.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe Share of Americans Who Are Mortgage-Free Is at an All-Time High The Impact and Cost of Musk’s Endorsement of Antisemitism on X Why America’s Wind Power Failures Are Good for GE Sequoia Icon Michael Moritz Bets $300 Million on Reshaping San Francisco At REI, a Progressive Company Warns That Unionization Is Bad for Vibes\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/six-documents-explain-doj-antitrust-110000406.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.106}}, {'date': '2023-11-17T10:06:00+00:00', 'title': \"Warren Buffett Has Bought Shares of This Stock for 21 Consecutive Quarters -- and It's Not Apple\", 'content': 'The Oracle of Omaha has put more than $72 billion to work buying shares of his favorite stock since mid-2018.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ed48d24a-a2ca-3933-9f40-0c7878c1ee70/warren-buffett-has-bought.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.637, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.206}}, {'date': '2023-11-17T10:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Cracks in Google’s dominance on show in tech’s trial of the century', 'content': \"Google\\n\\nSundar Pichai was nervous. In the days before the iPhone was released in 2007, Google and Apple executives were locked in discussions about a deal to make the search engine the default on the iPhone’s Safari browser.\\n\\nPichai, then the head of Google Chrome, raised concerns in an email to executives including Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder.\\n\\n“I don’t think it is a good user experience nor the optics is great [sic] for us to be the only provider in the browser,” he said, suggesting that rival search engine Yahoo should also be available as an alternative.\\n\\nNonetheless, the Apple agreement went ahead. Google became the default search engine on the iPhone.\\n\\nSixteen years later, Pichai is now chief executive and Google has been the default search engine on billions of iPhones, making what is already the world’s biggest search company even more successful. Google's current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, was the head of Google Chrome when the deal was struck with Apple back in 2007 - Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg\\n\\nUsers can choose alternatives in the settings menu, but few do.\\n\\nThe deal has been hugely lucrative for both sides, with Google paying roughly $18bn (£14.5bn) to Apple each year to maintain its place.\\n\\nNow, the agreement is at the centre of the US Government’s most significant lawsuit against big tech for a quarter of a century.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) claims Google has struck illegal deals to freeze out rivals and maintain its place as the dominant search engine, to the detriment of competition and innovation.\\n\\nIt is seeking to have the deals declared illegal, which could lead to them being prohibited in future. Lawyers for the DoJ wrapped up arguments in the two-month trial on Thursday.\\n\\nThe iPhone deal is not the only primacy arrangement agreed by Google but it is by far the biggest.\\n\\n“Apple owns one of the most important portals to the internet. And Google saw that,” says Gene Burrus, a competition lawyer who spent 15 years at Microsoft, much of it attempting to get regulators to pay more attention to Google.\\n\\nAlthough Google has faced fines and orders in the EU, a case on home territory represents the biggest challenge to its search dominance to date.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIt is the US government’s biggest tech case since it took on Microsoft in 1998 and is central to the Biden administration’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nIf the Government gets its way, Google’s exclusivity deals are at risk – and cracks in the business could start to show.\\n\\nThe Apple agreement and other smaller agreements with companies like Samsung cost Google $26bn in 2021 – more than one in every six dollars its search engine makes in revenue. It is a sign of just how significant executives view these deals.\\n\\nDeclaring them illegal could open up the search giant to competition it has not faced in two decades.\\n\\nMegan Gray, the former general counsel at rival search engine DuckDuckGo, who has been following the trial closely, says that Google has spent much of the proceedings seeking to present itself as it was 20 years ago – a youthful innovator, rather than the behemoth it is today.\\n\\n“I think Google still thinks of itself as this scrappy genius,” she says. “And that’s just not relevant anymore. Nobody cares how cute you were as a toddler, we’re looking at a bloodsucking company well into, in internet time, its middle age.” Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who met at Stanford University - Kim Kulish/Corbis Historical\\n\\nGray says that while a young hungry start-up might be justified in fighting for its place in the world, it is harder to justify one of the world’s biggest companies squeezing out competitors.\\n\\n“Google fights for every crumb of market share. The paranoia is immense,” she says.\\n\\nGoogle executives and lawyers have argued that the company merely has the best search engine and that it is not its fault that consumers do not switch to alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, a key point of the US case has been that Google’s dominance has prohibited rivals from building anything to challenge it.\\n\\nOver the years, Apple started to build search-like features into the iPhone, such as suggesting websites users might want to visit.\\n\\nThe company even considered buying Microsoft’s Bing, according to evidence presented during the trial. Google bristled and reworked its deal with Apple to stop the iPhone-maker launching features that would “bleed off traffic”.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s Satya Nadella, who called Apple a king-maker in internet search during his testimony, said that if Bing was able to strike the sort of deal Google had, it would soon catch up thanks to the wealth of data from iPhone users that would come its way.\\n\\nObservers say the US government’s lawsuit has gone better than expected.\\n\\n“My overall impression is that the [Justice] Department is unlikely to come away from this empty handed,” says Bill Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School and a former commissioner at the US Federal Trade Commission.\\n\\nAmit Mehta, the judge in the case, will decide next year on whether Google broke the law. If he decides it did, it will take another round of legal arguments to determine the penalty.\\n\\nAnalysts at Barclays said this week that if Google loses, it could be replaced on the iPhone by Bing, or Apple may even launch its own search engine.\\n\\nFor all the company’s supposed power, Google’s core product looks surprisingly vulnerable.\", 'link': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/cracks-google-dominance-show-tech-100000285.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.981, 'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.098}}, {'date': '2023-11-17T05:22:38+00:00', 'title': 'Q3 2023 Gogoro Inc Earnings Call', 'content': \"Participants\\n\\nBruce Morrison Aitken; CFO; Gogoro Inc.\\n\\nHok-Sum Luke; Founder, CEO & Chairman; Gogoro Inc.\\n\\nMichael George Bowen; MD; ICR, LLC\\n\\nPresentation\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWelcome to the Gogoro Inc. 2023 Q3 Earnings Call.

Thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you and provide an update on the third quarter 2023 results and for the rest of 2023. When we prepared for these quarterly results and remarks as well as answer your questions, we're always struck by the need to address the immediate quarter, but not to waiver from our mission.\\r\\nQuarters go up and down, results vary, but our mission remains unchanged. We're seeking to put smart swappable power in the reach of every urban rider in the world. This is a bold mission. One we are committed to. We seek to advance that cause every day. And as we've stated many times, we believe we are on the right path.\\r\\nOne at a time, individual riders are selecting a better, more sustainable, more data-driven riding experience by choosing to adopt the Gogoro battery swapping system. We know that our technology can change the world. In the ever-evolving mobility landscape, the macro message is clear. It is time for a sustainable shift. As our world faces growing environmental challenges, a fundamental transformation in our approach to mobility is imperative.\\r\\nAcross many regions, this shift to electric vehicles and EV second-life use are gaining momentum even in the face of legacy technologies. As stated last quarter, the long-term future remains bright despite some near-term challenges, and we remain excited for the future of vehicle and infrastructure electrification. We see a world where 2-wheel electric vehicle and battery swapping are affordable, stylish, and readily available, revolutionizing urban mobility while significantly reducing the environmental footprint. Similar to last quarter, the macroeconomic environment in Q3 has continued to be challenging, but we remain confident that customer interest remains high in the markets we serve and in new and prospective markets.\\r\\nLet me begin with a few recent highlights from Q3. We will elaborate on these in more detail, but I do want to start with some good news. In October, we launched our new CrossOver vehicle in the Taiwan market, a 2-wheel electric SUV. CrossOver is a new breed of versatile rugged vehicle that can be customized for different riders' personal use cases and needs.\\r\\nOur India vehicle factory is now up and running, and we've delivered our first made in India vehicle samples to B2B customers there. This is the first of our B2B-focused vehicles, which will include locally sourced components and is assembled in India. We'll be commercially launching that vehicle later this quarter. We've also announced an MOU with HPCL, a large Indian gas retailer to place GoStation at their station across India.\\r\\nWe launched a new Gogoro Experience Center in the Philippines together with Ayala Group, Globe Telecom and 917 Ventures with services going live before the end of the year. We also attended the Japan Mobility show together with MIH, Foxconn's EV consortium and demonstrated a 4-wheel concept car, which has both a fixed battery as well as Gogoro batteries. This lowers product cost with a smaller fixed battery, but doesn't impact range given the flexibility of the supplemental Gogoro batteries. We held our first post-pandemic Taipei Bridge community event.\\r\\nOver 2,000 Gogoro riders joined us at a Halloween night party and ride through Taipei Street, celebrating the ongoing transformation of urban mobility in Taiwan. We partnered with Apple on 2 new features. Our riders can now add a digital scooter key to the Apple Wallet on their iPhone and Apple Watch and use their phone or watch as their vehicle key.\\r\\nAnd in addition, we also work with Apple to integrate our vehicles into Apple's Find My feature across the device ecosystem. This is the world's first for 2-wheeler integration for both Apple and Gogoro.\\r\\nLastly, we are honored to be recognized as one of MIT Technology reviews 2023, 15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch. Gogoro has always pushed the envelope on what is possible in the electric mobility space, and we'll keep doing so with new products, new software capabilities and new partnerships.\\r\\nAs always, the team is working hard and despite the highlighted accomplishment, we're never satisfied. We'll continue to innovate and deliver new services and capabilities for existing customers and new vehicles to target new customers in new markets.\\r\\nDespite these strides forward, our core market of Taiwan continued to be challenging. Taiwan scooter market remains very competitive. Taiwan's macroeconomic environment continues to have a significant impact on consumer sentiment. Intense price competition continues as ICE manufacturers strive to maintain their market position and attract cost-conscious customers and government subsidies for ICE vehicles continue to be a barrier to EV adoption.\\r\\nIn Q3, the total number of registered scooters in Taiwan was 242,944, up 17% from Q3 2022. Through September 2023, the total number of registered scooter was 606,691, up 14% compared to 2022. The total number of registered electric scooter in Q3 in Taiwan was 20,815 units, down from 23,926 units in Q3 of last year. Of these electric scooters, approximately 17,314 were Gogoro powered vehicles and 15,302 were Gogoro branded vehicles. We attribute this slowing of electric vehicle purchase to the price competition from ICE vehicle makers.\\r\\nWhile unable to deliver competing electric vehicles, they're competing premium price and attracting the highly price conscious consumer segment with pricing power, scale and the ongoing government subsidies provided for the retirement of a gas vehicle.\\r\\nAny replacement gas vehicle will be on the road for 10 years or more, impeding the government's ability to achieve the net 0 targets. Climate change and achieving net 0 emission have become shared global challenges. The Taiwan government has declared its commitment to achieve net 0 commission by 2050. And all new 2-wheel and 4-wheel passenger vehicle will be electric by 2040. As also outlined that 35% of all new vehicles will be electric by 2030 and 70% by 2035. We are working on a number of initiatives to spur growth and meet these government objectives as the adoption rate of electric scooter is not keeping pace with the government's goals.\\r\\nClearly, the ongoing government subsidies for ICE vehicle is an obstacle to the EV adoption that needs to be changed. We are committed to substantial investment in our marketing and channel touch points in Taiwan and are on track with our target of rolling out 150 additional Gogoro Quick service stores by the end of the year.\\r\\nGogoro Quick service stores are smaller, more flexible and these shops service both EV as well as ICE vehicles, creating opportunities for existing ICE service workers to become certified to also repair Gogoro vehicles and ensure their livelihood in a changing era of mobility. As our installed base broadens, we want customers to be able to easily find a great service experience.\\r\\nIn addition, we are actively diversifying our product line and anticipate several significant vehicle introductions in the upcoming months. These new additions will broaden our product range at the high end of the performance stack as well as provide a compelling EV experience at the sweet spot of affordability. These products can serve the Taiwan market, but will also have broader global appeal.\\r\\nWe continue to scale the Gogoro Network. In Q3, we increased the total number of GoStation locations to 2,570 in Taiwan. Most of these locations that we added are Super GoStations, able to serve our growing customer base more efficiently.\\r\\nThrough our collaboration with a leading innovative energy service and Virtual Power Plant provider, Enel X, we have successfully deployed over 1,000 locations and integrated 2,500 battery swapping stations into the Enel X Virtual Power Plant or what we call VPP across Taiwan.\\r\\nAdditionally, we continue to demonstrate the growth of additional use cases for Gogoro Smart Batteries including 655 smart parking meters and 187 smart traffic signals, UPS backup across Taipei's major intersections, which are now live and operational. We have also recently won a government bid to build and demonstrate energy storage, which would be deployed in a variety of applications. This is another great demonstration of the flexibility and use cases for Gogoro Smart Batteries for second life utilization to generate additional second life revenue beyond mobility.\\r\\nCommunity is important to us. We're building a community of like-minded socially conscious consumers who want a great riding experience, a great refueling experience via our almost instant Swap & Go service, but also want to play their part to address the challenges of urban mobility and sustainability. We built communities through a variety of events.\\r\\nOnce a customer has become a Gogoro rider, they frequently engage broadly not only with the Gogoro community, but with other causes such as the increased use of alternative energy, engagement on climate challenges and other local issues. After a 3-year hiatus, our flagship Taipei Bridge community event made a strong comeback on October 28.\\r\\nAnd for the first time, we hosted a Halloween themed Costume Night. The event attracted over 2,000 Gogoro and partner vehicle owners, GoShare users and electric vehicle enthusiasts from all over Taiwan. The grand finale was the night ride on the Taipei Bridge, which saw more than 1,500 electric scooters, making 0 noise, 0 fume and marking for a successful and funding conclusion to the ride.\\r\\nWe aim to let more consumers understand and enjoy the positive influence of adopting electric scooters. We owe our success to all the support and passion of our more than 2.6 million Gogoro and GoShare users. We are continuing our effort to provide innovative products and top-notch services to enhance the quality of life and the environment. We regularly refresh our product road map and the new products and services introduced in Q3. These products will be delivered in volume throughout Q4.\\r\\nIn late July, we launched a collaboration with famous Japanese designer Naoto Fukasawa, and the MUJI brand. The collaboration includes the newly designed Gogoro VIVA ME and the Gogoro VIVA MIX ME, along with a range of merchandise and accessories. These vehicles have been very popular with our customers who appreciate the design simplicity and the use of recycled polypropylene panels made from plastic waste.\\r\\nThese plastic waste was partially supplied by Gogoro and MUJI customers. These are examples of how Gogoro's products are not just 2-wheelers, but our product is seeking to address larger issues of pollution, waste and allow community members to make a difference while also getting from point to point in their daily lives. These are small but meaningful steps in creating a more sustainable community in future.\\r\\nLast month, we unveiled the all-new Gogoro CrossOver Smartscooter, marking the debut of our first 2-wheel SUV. Engineered to be rugged, perfect for a heavy workload and super adaptable, CrossOver riders can personalize and customize their vehicle with a wide range of accessories and over 100 color combinations.\\r\\nBuilt on a brand-new design all-terrain frame, they combined increased steadiness with a range of storage and riding capabilities. We can expect to see CrossOver on the road before end of this month.\\r\\nLast week, we announced a collaboration with Apple to integrate our digital scooter key in Apple Wallet and Apple Find My network capabilities into our Smartscooter. Our riders can now add a scooter key to Apple Wallet on their iPhone and Apple Watch, enhancing the riding experience by offering a seamless and touchless solution while also offering additional security and privacy advantages. We're excited to be introducing the first 2-wheelers in the world that support Apple scooter key in Apple Wallet.\\r\\nThis is not only available on new Smartscooters, but it will also be available to more than 300,000 existing Gogoro customers in Taiwan. We also announced that in the coming months, selected Smartscooter owners will be able to use Apple Find My feature to locate their vehicles.\\r\\nBoth of these technologies are initially available in Taiwan, but we will also be rolling them out to other markets in the future. We're always looking for ways to improve and provide more innovative, smarter, and more convenient riding experiences to our customers.\\r\\nOver the past few weeks, we participate in the Japanese Mobility Show within the MIH consortium booth. The MIH consortium has an open EV ecosystem that promotes collaboration in the mobility industry. During the event, we demonstrated our industry-leading battery swapping technology alongside with our new CrossOver and MUJI scooter.\\r\\nAdditionally, MIH unveiled the much anticipated Project X concept car. The Project X, which features a unique fixed battery system integrated with Gogoro Smart Batteries that uses Gogoro battery swapping, a significant step in addressing user concerns about urban range anxiety. This marks Gogoro's first entrance into 4-wheel transportation and is another significant milestone.\\r\\nLast month, MIT Technology Review named Gogoro as one of the 2023, 15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch. The award spotlights businesses that possess significant potential to make substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emission or tackle the challenges of global warming. We are honored to receive this recognition and congratulate the other winners as well. Collectively, we can make it different for the future.\\r\\nIn September, we're delighted to announce a new Gogoro concept store in Taiwan. This store is uniquely centered around the use of recycled glass material, emphasizing the importance of second life material and our continued commitment to the sustainable reuse of resources, making Gogoro retail experience relevant to the local community and promoting the awareness of sustainability. We continue to use 40% to 50% renewable energy in our Gogoro factories and are committed to increase the number of fully renewable powered supplied retail stores in our channel.\\r\\nWith that high-level overview of our Q3 activities and results, I'd like to invite Bruce to provide an update on our international plans as well as financial update.\\n\\nBruce Morrison Aitken\\n\\nThanks, Horace. We are actively expanding our presence internationally with a clear focus on our commercial launch in India, but we're also launching in the Philippines and continue to expand our 12 city operation in Korea as well as maintaining pilots in other markets.\\r\\nOur manufacturing capabilities in India are established, and we are manufacturing our first vehicles using locally sourced components, which readies us for India's FAME II incentive program, which is an incentive scheme for manufacturers of EVs intended by the government to spur EV adoption.\\r\\nWe anticipate beginning our smart battery pack manufacturing in the first half of 2024, and we're thankful to the government of Maharashtra for their ongoing support as well as to our suppliers that are working with us to manufacture locally in India. We've made a rugged, high-quality vehicle that meets local market pricing demands. The value proposition for a high-quality vehicle and for battery swapping is most evident in the B2B market segment, where vehicle downtime for traditional charging isn't an option because of lost orders and lost revenue to both individual riders and fleet operators.\\r\\nWe're pleased to share that in the past few weeks, we've delivered our first vehicles to B2B partners for testing, and we will be announcing more commercialization details about our Smartscooter and Gogoro Network battery swapping launch soon.\\r\\nAs we launch services in new cities, ensuring sufficient swap station locations exist to meet customer needs and operate an effective Gogoro Network is critical. We can place stations at B2B delivery hubs, but open stations are a critical part of the overall infrastructure build-out as well.\\r\\nLast week, we announced a significant MOU with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, or HPCL, one of India's leading oil companies to roll out Gogoro battery swapping stations at thousands of HPCL gas stations across India in the coming years, giving us potential access to HPCL's 21,000-plus retail locations, a large customer-facing footprint.\\r\\nEarlier this year, we formed a joint venture in the Philippines with market leaders, Ayala Corporation, Globe and 917 Ventures, Inc. to launch Gogoro Smartscooters and battery swapping in the Philippines starting with Manila.\\r\\nJust last week, we opened our first Gogoro Experience Center in Manila, which is located in the Greenbelt mall in Makati. The Gogoro Experience Center showcases both our vehicles and battery swapping. We welcome all of our Filipino fans to visit the store and personally experience Gogoro for yourself. This marks the beginning of our Philippines go-to-market campaign, and we plan to begin sales and deliveries in December.\\r\\nThe Philippine government has demonstrated a commitment to electrification by reducing tariffs on imported batteries and swap stations to negligible levels. Extending that reduction to include 2-wheel vehicles would make a big difference in the pace of EV adoption in the Philippines.\\r\\nIn fact, import duties on 4-wheel vehicles have been removed for a period of 5 years to spur growth, and we hope the government will replicate this policy for 2-wheelers. This support would help speed the transition of Filipino consumers to clean electric vehicles and help with ongoing pollution challenges in densely populated Manila.\\r\\nOur business in Korea is stable and growing. We now have GoStations deployed in 12 cities and our vehicles are powering deliveries and individual customers' needs across the country. I'm proud of the way the entire Gogoro team has rallied around our financial objectives. We have very intentionally monitored our cash position and conserved cash. We have aggressively sought to maintain our gross margin despite slightly reduced volume, and we have again delivered positive EBITDA for the 19th quarter in a row and also delivered positive operating cash.\\r\\nDespite the drop in Q3 revenue associated with lower manufacturing volumes, the balance of our financial results are quite positive. We will continue to focus on investments like international expansion that drive growth. We will continue to prioritize a healthy business rather than chase price competition, and we will continue to focus on efficiency of operations, including material costs, manufacturing costs, overhead and capital expenditures.\\r\\nFully 30% of our spending is now directed towards international growth with an even higher percentage of our R&D costs directed towards India. We now have a solid team in India. We have factory plans for both vehicle and battery packs, and we will be allocating capital in Q4 2023 and 2024 to continue to expand our GoStation network footprint.\\r\\nTurning to third quarter 2023 financial results. For the third quarter, total revenue was $91.8 million, down 10.2% year-over-year and down 6.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Had the foreign exchange rates remained constant with the average rate of the same quarter last year, revenue would have been up by an additional $3.8 million.\\r\\nSales of hardware and other revenue for the quarter was $58.2 million, down 19% year-over-year and down 15.2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Both electric powered 2-wheelers and powered by the Gogoro Network markets were negatively impacted by the result of deep discounts on internal combustion engine vehicles introduced by Taiwan scooter manufacturers in the third quarter.\\r\\nWe refrained from participating in the price war as we believe that this approach is not in the best interest of Gogoro's long-term growth strategy. Compared to the same quarter last year, sales of all electric power 2-wheelers were down 13%, and Gogoro branded vehicles were down by 18%. Battery swapping service revenue for the third quarter was $33.6 million, up 10.4% year-over-year and up 14.1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.\\r\\nTotal subscribers at the end of the third quarter exceeded 570,000, up 12.9% from 505,000 subscribers at the end of the same quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in battery swapping service revenue was primarily due to our larger subscriber base compared to the same quarter last year and the high retention rate of our subscribers. We continue to see the strength of our subscription-based business model to accrue more customers to maximize our battery swapping network efficiency.\\r\\nFor the third quarter, gross margin was 18.3%, up from 17.4% in the same quarter last year, while non-IFRS gross margin was 19.2%, down slightly from 20% in the same quarter last year. The favorable change in gross margin was driven by the improved cost efficiencies of Gogoro's battery swapping services and improvements in other operational efficiencies. This favorable change was partially offset by the higher production cost per vehicle due to limited volume by increased promotion cost per vehicle and changes in the mix of vehicles sold.\\r\\nFor the third quarter, net loss was $3.1 million, down $59.5 million from a net income of $56.4 million in the same quarter last year. The net loss was primarily due to a decrease of $66.6 million in the fair value of financial liabilities associated with outstanding earnout shares, earn-in shares and warrants compared to last year as a result of the decrease of Gogoro's stock price and also a $1 million decrease in gross profits due to lower revenue. The net loss was partially offset by an $8 million decrease in operating expenses, primarily consisting of a $2.1 million decrease in share-based compensation, a $4.7 million decrease in expenses for sales and marketing programs, mainly due to our efforts in increasing marketing efficiency and a $1 million decrease in research and development expenses.\\r\\nFor the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $13.1 million, up from $9.2 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a $5.9 million decrease in operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation as a result of various cost savings initiatives. The increase was partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in non-IFRS gross margin due to lower volume. We reduced operating cash outflow by $40.5 million compared to the same quarter last year by tightening our business operations and reducing working capital. We borrowed $72.8 million and paid back $63.4 million in bank loans in the third quarter to finance our investing activities. With $151.5 million cash balance at the end of the third quarter and additional credit facilities, we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our near-term business growth objectives.\\r\\nBased on the current market outlook, we are making no change to our estimated 2023 revenue guidance range of $340 million to $370 million. We also continue to estimate that Gogoro will generate approximately 95% of 2023 full year revenue from the Taiwan market.\\r\\nWith that financial update, I'll hand things back to Michael for Q&A.\\n\\nQuestion and Answer Session\\n\\nMichael George Bowen\\n\\n(technical difficulty) color on India and the Philippine market's expansion plans and status. And when do you anticipate material sales from either market?\\n\\nHok-Sum Luke\\n\\nThanks, Michael. I'll take that. I'll address India first and then the Philippines. We have a vehicle factory up and running in India, and as you saw in the presentation there, and we have made great progress towards our battery pack factory readiness, and we expect to be operational in the first half of 2024. We've already delivered samples of our locally sourced and assembled vehicles to our B2B partners and have already started to book some orders. We've also begun deploying GoStations in Delhi and will begin rolling out to other cities soon. We're extremely grateful to our suppliers, our partners and especially the government of Maharashtra, our prospective customers and all the participants in our pilot.\\r\\nWe've learned a great deal about the Indian riding conditions through the pilot, and we used those learnings to ensure that our vehicle and a network offering will meet customers' expectations. The technology now I can say, is ready to go. In the Philippines, we've opened a Gogoro Experience Center through our joint venture with Ayala, Globe, and 917 Ventures. The GEC opening was a great start to our presence in the Manila and we'll be providing more details about our vehicle and network plans in the coming weeks.\\r\\nIf you're in Manila, come to our Experience Center in the Greenbelt mall and see how cool Gogoro products are for yourself. You can even take one for a test ride, if you like. We've always said that Taiwan would represent approximately 95% of the revenue short term in 2023, and that is exactly the case. We expect revenue from international markets to grow in 2024 and provide a meaningful uplift to our total revenue overall.\\n\\nMichael George Bowen\\n\\nOkay. Thanks Horace. We also have another question. For the past quarters, you've shown good control on your financial metrics like margin, cash flow, EBITDA and trimming your net loss figures. Could you elaborate on whether you think you'll be able to keep that trend going?\\n\\nBruce Morrison Aitken\\n\\nThanks, Michael. We've been working hard, as you can tell across the company to ensure that we exercise financial discipline. It's not just the finance team. It has to happen across our operations, across our international teams, across the entire employee team. And we've got alignment on that clear goal. We've got clear intention from each team member to think like an owner and to be financially responsible. So when volumes are down a bit or when other challenging circumstances arise, we have to keep that focus on our long-term financial stability. That includes establishing and executing to the right metrics. Some of which are the ones that you mentioned above. So we're closely tracking spending for efficiency. We're tracking EBITDA. And as mentioned, we've been EBITDA positive now for 19 consecutive quarters. We're making progress towards everyone's goal, including our own turning cash flow positive. So we're doing those things while focusing to invest for growth, both here in Taiwan, but also in international markets. We'll keep the focus. We'll keep working closely with the operations team to make wise investments, and we intend to continue the trend of solid financial results.\\n\\nMichael George Bowen\\n\\nAll right. Thank you, Bruce, and Horace. So operator, could you please now open the line up for the Q&A session.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) We have online questions from the audience. Gogoro batteries are the perfect size and capacity to power electric forklifts, lawnmowers, golf carts, and portable energy stations. Does Gogoro have any plans on selling your batteries to businesses and consumers around the world and going beyond battery subscriptions? This will help create diverse ecosystem of devices that Gogoro batteries can power like the way AA batteries have done?\\n\\nHok-Sum Luke\\n\\nSure. This is a great question. We've always seen batteries as a module of portable power. Of course, with Gogoro today, you've seen us taking care of 2-wheel vehicles as well as 3-wheel vehicle. And very soon, you saw us just in the Tokyo Auto show, where we demonstrated how we can actually apply that to 4 wheelers as well. the batteries have always been just as you said, they are like AA form factor type of configuration where we're going to use a single battery or 2 batteries in parallel or in series or even 4 batteries in either all in series or in parallel or a 2x2 configuration.\\r\\nOf course, this can empower a lot of different type of equipment, such as you mentioned, forklifts, golf carts and others. But at Gogoro, we are for the short term being, we are very, very focused on the largest opportunity ahead of us. Given that we are -- we have built the world's perhaps densest battery with the most amount of energy for the volume and the weight that it has. We believe that there is a great application to the mobility space, which happens to be one of the largest, of course, the opportunity, not only for financial opportunities, but also for impact opportunity where we can actually change countries like India or cities across Southeast Asia. We believe that that is out, at the moment, a very, very focused goal for us.\\r\\nBut also at the same time, we are constantly talking with and planning for in 1 day, we will apply our battery to other configurations as well, other type of news as well. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe do have another question from the online audience. Gogoro batteries have been proven to be safe and durable with years of real-world data. Do you have any plans on opening up your battery platform and selling batteries to other e-bikes manufacturers?\\n\\nHok-Sum Luke\\n\\nI'll take that as well, Bruce. I think the question of enabling, using our battery power and battery swapping system for others is exactly along our thesis. We have, of course, been partnering with Yamaha with Suzuki Taiwan with a motor, it's by Aeon with PGO and a number of other vehicle makers, a total of about 11 or 12 different vehicle makers across the world. The list keeps growing and growing and growing because they see the value of what our technology brings to them when they think about electrification of their fleet and their businesses. I think all of us can agree that there is an imminent change coming, especially around lighter weight urban mobility, where electrification is possible and will happen.\\r\\nAnd so we're working with these larger vehicle makers to bring our value of not only our battery but our battery swapping system that enable the consumer to get on board without having to worry about range anxiety, without having to worry about buying a battery, which not only is the purchase price of the battery, but also the replacement cost potentially when the battery needs the retirement.\\r\\nAnd also at the same time, providing city governments a great solution for safety and predictability as we put these stations and centralize our charging instead of scattering them all around the different parts of apartment buildings and all over town. We do constantly work with a number of other vehicle makers as well, planning for even a greater footprint, not only in different cities but also with different vehicle types and different brands across the world.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) I see there are no further question at this time. I would like to hand the call back to Michael for closing.\\n\\nMichael George Bowen\\n\\nOkay. Thank you, operator. So at this time, we will hand the conference back over to Horace for a few closing remarks. Thank you.\\n\\nHok-Sum Luke\\n\\nThanks, Michael. I'm always energized by the chance to share with you our progress with all the investors that are on the call. In a tough market condition like we're facing today, we are focusing on continuing to deliver technology and solutions that customers want. This can take us in the shape of new vehicles or services, improve management of our Gogoro Network or the initiation of our services in new markets. We've launched a number of these new services and products in Q2 and Q3, and we'll keep doing so in the remainder of 2023 and into Q1 2024. At Gogoro, we believe it is a great time to be contributing to the transition to green urban mobility. And we appreciate your support along the way.\\r\\nThank you for calling in today. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-2023-gogoro-inc-earnings-052238467.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.164}}, {'date': '2023-11-17T04:43:57+00:00', 'title': \"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong - what's moving markets\", 'content': 'Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap\\'s (NYSE:GPS) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.\\n\\n1. Futures tick mostly higher\\n\\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.\\n\\nBy 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the Dow futures contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly unchanged.\\n\\nIn the prior session, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.\\n\\nSentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.\\n\\n2. Gap\\'s earnings beat\\n\\nShares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.\\n\\nIn the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNet sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.\\n\\nThe San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), conceded that it still needs to create \"trend-right product assortments\" to bring more customers back into its stores.\\n\\nGap\\'s outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.\\n\\n3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.\\n\\nIn a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer \"better interoperability\" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.\\n\\nApple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles.

This transaction, which saw the firm adding shares at a price of $2.465 each, represents a 0.07% impact on the firm's portfolio, increasing its position in the company to 0.12% and its holdings to 7.56%. The move by Polar Capital Holdings Plc (Trades, Portfolio) underscores a strategic investment decision in the healthcare sector, which is one of the firm's top sectors of focus.\\n\\nInvestment Firm Profile: Polar Capital Holdings Plc (Trades, Portfolio)\\n\\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ARQT.\\n\\nPolar Capital Holdings Plc (Trades, Portfolio), based at 16 Palace Street, London, is an investment firm with a keen focus on value and growth. With an equity portfolio worth $14.2 billion and 250 stocks under management, the firm has a diverse range of top holdings including technology giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and healthcare leaders. The firm's investment philosophy is centered around identifying undervalued stocks with potential for significant returns. Polar Capital Holdings Plc (Trades, Portfolio)'s top sectors are technology and healthcare, indicating a balanced approach to high-growth and stable investment opportunities. Polar Capital Holdings Plc Bolsters Portfolio with Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc Stake\\n\\nCompany Overview: Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc\\n\\nArcutis Biotherapeutics Inc, a medical dermatology company based in the USA, specializes in developing treatments for immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions. With a market capitalization of $184.045 million, the company has been leveraging advances in immunology to create differentiated therapies. Its lead product candidate, ZORYVE roflumilast cream, has shown promising results in clinical trials for plaque psoriasis. Despite its innovative approach, the stock has experienced a decline in market value, currently priced at $1.95, a significant drop from its IPO price on January 31, 2020.\\n\\nStory continues Polar Capital Holdings Plc Bolsters Portfolio with Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc Stake\\n\\nTrade Impact Analysis\\n\\nThe recent acquisition by Polar Capital Holdings Plc (Trades, Portfolio) has increased its stake in Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc, reflecting a growing confidence in the company's prospects. The trade has altered the firm's portfolio composition, albeit marginally, with a 0.12% position and a 7.56% holding in the biotechnology company. This move could signal a strategic bet on the company's future performance and its role in the healthcare sector.\\n\\nFinancial Health and Stock Performance\\n\\nArcutis Biotherapeutics Inc's financial health presents a mixed picture. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) stand at -179.23% and -68.64%, respectively, indicating significant losses relative to equity and assets. However, its Cash to Debt ratio of 1.11 suggests a reasonable level of liquidity. The stock's performance metrics, including a GF Score of 28/100, indicate poor future performance potential, with low ranks in Profitability Rank, Growth Rank, and Momentum Rank.\\n\\nMarket Reaction and Valuation\\n\\nSince the trade, Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc's stock has declined by 20.89%, and it has plummeted by 91.54% since its IPO. The year-to-date performance is also down by 86.8%. With no applicable GF Value due to insufficient data, the stock's valuation cannot be evaluated, presenting a challenge for investors trying to determine its intrinsic value.\\n\\nInvestment Considerations\\n\\nInvestors considering Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc must weigh the potential of its product pipeline against the backdrop of its financial metrics and stock performance. The company's ranks in Financial Strength, Piotroski F-Score, and other exclusive metrics suggest caution, although the firm's investment could be predicated on long-term value creation.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nPolar Capital Holdings Plc (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent trade in Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc represents a noteworthy development in its investment strategy. While the company's current financial health and stock performance metrics suggest challenges, the firm's stake could be a long-term play on the company's innovative dermatological treatments. Investors will be watching closely to see if this bet pays off in the evolving landscape of medical dermatology.\\n\\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

And with the change goes some of Apple’s clout.\\n\\nThe iPhone maker in late 2024 will integrate the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging standard, a more advanced text delivery system across different brands of phones, 9to5Mac first reported on Thursday. The protocol will support some iMessage features for text chains that include an Android user, including indicators that a message has been read by a recipient and that they are typing, and the ability to send high-quality images and videos.\\n\\nApple didn’t respond to questions about specific iMessage features that RCS could adopt. Among the possibilities are support for “liking” or “emphasizing” texts, or sending messages with visual effects, like “invisible ink” and “balloons.”\\n\\nPreviously, texts between iPhone and non-iPhone users sent via SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), systems created in 1992 and 2002, which have been criticized for being outdated. RCS was created in 2007 as a more secure alternative with more sophisticated features, and it is the standard communication platform between Google and Samsung phones.\\n\\n“We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,” an Apple spokesperson told 9to5Mac. “This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.”\\n\\nFor more than a decade, messages between iPhones appeared in an azure color for Apple users, while messages with a non-iPhone user appeared lime green. The blue text bubbles have become somewhat of a status symbol among young users, with Androiders excluded from iPhone group texts to keep the blue bubble aesthetic and green texts jokingly considered a red flag among some singles in the dating scene. Apple has accepted the social status associated with its product and the business it drives, blocking the more advanced RCS standard from its devices until now.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIt is unclear if the adoption of RCS means the green text bubbles will change to blue—Apple didn’t respond to Fortune’s query about it—but integrating a more advanced messaging protocol for communication with non-iPhones is a major concession by the company. While the announcement doesn’t mean non-iPhone users get access to iMessage, it does mean the walls around Apple’s iMessage empire are coming down. iMessage will remain the primary messaging platform between iPhone users.\\n\\nApple’s change didn’t happen in a vacuum. In recent months, the EU has forced Apple to change a number of its practices to improve competition and consumer convenience. New EU rules required all phone companies to offer a common USB-C charging port by the end of 2024, which put a spotlight on Apple and its incompatible 11-year-old Lightning Cable. For the newest iPhone 15, the company replaced its proprietary port with the EU-friendly (and Android-friendly) USB-C. Apple plans on changing its App Store policies to comply with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA), which could mean offering third-party stores on its devices and cutting into the profit from Apple’s App Store monopoly.\\n\\nThe RCS integration wasn’t required by the EU, but it might be a way to appease regulators and limit future problems. The EU Commission is weighing whether iMessage falls under the DMA’s purview, and a decision that it does would mean Apple might have to improve the interoperability of its devices anyway. The move is also somewhat of a counter-lobbying strategy. Google has lobbied the Commission to regulate iMessage under the DMA. By taking a proactive approach and introducing the RCS standard, Apple weakens Google’s case and may\\xa0solve the problem the DMA intends to tackle.\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-folds-third-time-eu-223328487.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.963, 'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.078}}, {'date': '2023-11-16T22:11:00+00:00', 'title': 'Apple finally makes massive change that will benefit all phone users', 'content': 'Apple is a renowned innovator of tech hardware, but the company is also known for having a gated ecosystem that benefits users in it and hinders those outside of it.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on climate change and retirement, you may go to the 5 Cheapest Warm Places to Retire in the World.\\n\\nClimate Change and Retirement\\n\\nAn estimated 12,000 Americans succumb to heat waves each year, highlighting the escalating impact of rising temperatures on health. According to Climate Central, a staggering 80% of these fatalities involve individuals aged 60 and above. As the Earth's temperatures rise and global populations continue to age, these figures are poised to worsen, implying that climate risk is now a major factor that prospective retirees must incorporate into their retirement plans.\\n\\nBased on the Schroders 2022 U.S. Retirement Survey, it is evident that there is an increasing awareness among individuals regarding these pressing climate issues, as well as a discernible commitment to address and improve their environmental impact. 74% state that they would increase their overall contribution in defined contribution plans if they were offered ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) options.\\n\\n78% of plan participants also believe that socially responsible companies have better financial results over time too. Unfortunately, only 5% of 401 (k) plans offer climate-safe sustainable fund options at the moment. Owing to this growing awareness, the year 2022 saw many shareholders such as those at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) vote on proposals seeking information on how these companies are protecting employees from climate-related investment risk in their 401(k) retirement plans.\\n\\n“There has been significant growth in the availability of ESG funds over the past five years, but including them in 401(k) plans has been slower.”\\n\\n- Georges Dyer, co-founder and executive director of the Crane Institute of Sustainability\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSince employees are automatically enrolled in 401(k) plans without weighing in on their options, most of the money Americans have in their plans is likely contributing to deforestation and fossil fuel extraction. It is estimated that $35 trillion is invested in American retirement assets without considering the financial risks that are posed by climate change.\\n\\nHowever, many companies are now ceasing their investments in high-carbon industries in hopes of boosting their environmental record and having positive financial gains and fund performance. Big-tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), are also making investments to reach their carbon goals and improve profitability. In March 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested in a project called Genecis, a startup that makes biodegradable plastic through food waste.\\n\\nGeekWire further reports that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has 22 companies that are invested in climate tech and clean energy. On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has 25 companies working in the same sectors. By prioritizing sustainability and engaging in responsible business practices, these corporations have a better chance of improving their productivity, margins, as well as investor confidence.\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), amongst others, are also taking steps to reduce their carbon footprints and switch to renewable energy sources. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has committed to be carbon neutral by 2030, Amazon plans to do so by 2040, and Microsoft has made similar commitments to be fulfilled by 2030.\\n\\nNavigating Climate Risks in Retirement Planning: The Changing Landscape of Popular Destinations\\n\\nClimate change is exerting its influence not just on the world we inhabit but is also significantly shaping the landscape of retirement for individuals. Due to climate change alone, many popular retirement destinations are now at risk of extreme weather events. For instance, Queensland, one of the best places to retire in Australia, could be hit by tropical cyclones with increasing frequency given that climate change continues to worsen. Many coastal communities such as those in Texas are also likely to be hit by climate change in the future. As a result of extreme weather events, people are likely to witness soaring insurance premiums, as well as rising cold and heat.\\n\\nWith the planet getting warmer and the weather becoming more extreme, buying a retirement home and protecting it has become even more challenging than before.\\n\\n“Climate will have a profound impact on not only where people want to be covered but also their insurability.\\n\\n- Howard Botts, CoreLogic’s chief scientist\\n\\nTherefore, when contemplating the perfect retirement spot, factoring in climate risk is increasingly becoming important for potential retirees. Choosing a home that is safe from potential risks and disasters can help save them from expenses and damages. At the same time, affordability emerges as a crucial factor for those seeking to relocate from high-cost living regions.

But another topic was almost completely avoided even with a key deadline looming in just about six weeks: the Trump-era tariffs on a range of Chinese goods.\\n\\nIn fact, the word \"tariff\" didn\\'t appear at all in the official transcript of President Biden\\'s press conference following the meeting — or in the official White House summary of the four-hour meeting.\\n\\nTrade issues more broadly only earned a glancing mention following the sit-down with a note that Biden \"raised continued concerns about the PRC\\'s unfair trade policies.\" During a follow-up speech before CEOs Thursday, Biden only briefly mentioned trade issues and instead focused most of his time on his overall economic record and what he described as his administration\\'s work across the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\nBut Biden and his team will still need to wrestle with the trade issue in the coming weeks before an end-of-year deadline to complete a four-year review of the so-called Section 301 tariffs that then-President Trump imposed on China in 2018.\\n\\nThe bottom line, according to experts: It\\'s likely that those controversial duties will simply be extended as-is — with the prospects for change even dimmer in 2024 given the election season. US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together after their meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in California this week. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\\n\\n\"Ever since Biden was elected, the trade community had hoped for a reversal of the Trump-era trade tariffs,\" said Ashley Craig, a D.C.-based international trade lawyer at Venable LLP, in an interview this week.\\n\\nBut his prediction for 2024 is that \"the president\\'s not going to substantially modify the current status on US-Sino trade relations going into next year and the election; that\\'s just not going to work with his base.\"\\n\\nThe pessimistic outlook was echoed elsewhere with Nick Marro, a lead for global trade at The Economist Intelligence Unit, saying any moves could be in the opposite direction. \"Our own base case is that the US will tighten many of its trade and investment restrictions on China in the coming years,\" he wrote in a recent note, adding that election year pressures will push Biden to be tougher on China.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat \"could end up plunging US-China ties back into a state of volatility,\" said Marro.\\n\\nThe Biden administration\\'s view\\n\\nMany in the business community have long advocated for a loosening of these trade restrictions, noting that US companies pay these tariffs — not China\\'s government. But the Biden administration contends that the tariffs are interlinked with an array of other complicated issues unlikely to be resolved soon.\\n\\nAhead of this week\\'s meeting, a senior Biden official lumped in trade with issues like human rights and the territorial claims over the South China sea as \"issues where we have differences.\" The official signaled that movement on trade would likely be contingent on China being more friendly to American companies around issues such as forced technology transfers and Chinese state controls, which Xi doesn\\'t appear likely to move away from anytime soon. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo speaks at dinner with American CEOs also attended by Xi Jinping on Nov. 15 in San Francisco. (CARLOS BARRIA/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) (CARLOS BARRIA via Getty Images)\\n\\nBut trade was brought up directly in one notable venue this week: a dinner Wednesday night with American CEOs.\\n\\nJust moments before the Chinese president himself spoke — as CEOs like Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) and Marc Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) looked on — US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo echoed the administration trade position saying she is in favor of more trade, but only \"on a level playing field that is reciprocal and that is fair.\"\\n\\nXi has long criticized US trade policy and export controls, telling Biden from across the negotiating table Wednesday that it was a grave problem that \"protectionism is rising,\" according to an official translation. But he largely choose to strike an optimistic tone in most of his public comments.\\n\\nIn his own speech before the assembled CEOs Wednesday night, Xi focused more on building bridges between the US and China. He even suggested that Chinese pandas could be coming back to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., after the former residents were recalled to the PRC earlier this year.\\n\\nWhere things go from here\\n\\nPanda diplomacy aside, this week\\'s lack of trade news likely means that the Trump-era tariffs will continue.\\n\\n\"We expect the Biden administration will announce the extension of most of the 2018 tariffs on Chinese imports,\" Stifel\\'s chief Washington policy strategist, Brian Gardner, wrote to clients. He also said he was concerned that new export restrictions on chips used in artificial intelligence could also be in the offing.\\n\\nThe question is whether this week\\'s happy talk in other areas could lower the chances of escalation on the trade front. Not likely is the answer from many observers, who note that potential flashpoints from both coming elections in Taiwan as well as voting in the US could rachet up tensions in the months ahead.\\n\\nIn any case, the business world has largely adapted to the tariffs, said Craig, the trade lawyer.\\n\\n\"Keep in mind that even though the trade community despises the 301 structure, we are now years deep into it and most, if not all, US companies have pivoted,\" he noted this week. Craig works with many ocean shippers who feel the tariffs most directly but he notes that companies long ago took measures to minimize, or at least factor in, the increased costs.\\n\\nAsked what companies are expecting from Washington, he added, \"Our clients are not really holding their breath.\"\\n\\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\\n\\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-summit-the-trump-tariffs-remain-firmly-in-place-after-another-bidenxi-meeting-194843025.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'CRM.US', 'FOO.F', 'FOO.XETRA', 'SSFO34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.075, 'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.928, 'pos': 0.037}}, {'date': '2023-11-16T19:34:12+00:00', 'title': 'Warren Buffett Is Expected To Rake In Over $6 Billion In Dividends In The Next Year - Here Are His 3 Biggest Income-Producing Stocks', 'content': 'Warren Buffett, the venerated investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is set to amass over $6 billion in dividend income in the coming year, with a significant portion of this windfall emanating from just three stocks. This substantial income stream underscores the effectiveness of Buffett\\'s investment strategy, one that favors profitability and long-term value.\\n\\nTop Dividend Earners in Buffett’s Portfolio\\n\\nBuffett’s predilection for dividend-bearing stocks isn’t just a matter of preference; it’s a testament to his investment acumen. Among his top dividend earners, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stands out, with expected dividend earnings of approximately $991.5 million. A leading financial institution, BofA has thrived in the higher interest rate environment, seeing a substantial increase in its net-interest income.\\n\\nDon\\'t Miss:\\n\\nHomeownership may be out of reach for most Americans, but that\\'s not stopping these average investors from raking in passive income on single-family rentals through fractional ownership. Expecting a recession? This is where to put your money for the greatest upside.\\n\\nOccidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) follows closely, with Berkshire poised to earn around $964.2 million, including dividends from preferred stock. This significant holding stems from Berkshire’s strategic move in 2019, where it invested $10 billion in Occidental preferred stock at an impressive 8% yield, to support Occidental’s acquisition of Anadarko.\\n\\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), known for its robust capital returns, is another major contributor to Buffett’s dividend income. The technology behemoth, with its consistent dividend payouts and aggressive stock buyback program, is expected to add approximately $878.9 million to Berkshire\\'s dividend coffers.\\n\\nBuffett\\'s investment in dividend stocks aligns with a broader market trend that favors consistent and growing payouts. A decade ago, JPMorgan Chase’s wealth-management division highlighted the outperformance of dividend payers over non-payers, with the former achieving annualized returns of 9.5% from 1972 to 2012, compared to just 1.6% for non-payers. This data supports Buffett\\'s approach, demonstrating the potential for stable and significant returns through dividend investing.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don\\'t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.\\n\\nThe Retail Investor\\'s Advantage Over Buffett\\n\\nWhile Buffett\\'s dividend strategy is lucrative, retail investors should approach with caution. Investing in the same stocks as Buffett does not guarantee similar success. Each investor\\'s financial situation is unique. What works for Berkshire may not align with the individual goals and risk tolerance of retail investors.\\n\\nThere’s also an intriguing twist in the narrative: retail investors might have an edge over giant funds like Berkshire Hathaway in certain aspects of investing. This seeming paradox stems from the inherent limitations that come with managing a behemoth fund.\\n\\nDecades ago, Buffett remarked on his extraordinary returns in the 1950s, noting, \"I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts back then. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee it.\" This statement underlines a critical point: smaller investment scales can maneuver and capitalize on opportunities that are off-limits to larger funds.\\n\\nThe reality for Berkshire Hathaway, a company valued at hundreds of billions of dollars, is that investing in small-cap companies – often ripe for explosive growth – poses significant challenges. A modest investment in such a company, while potentially yielding high returns percentage-wise, would barely make a dent in Berkshire\\'s overall portfolio. Conversely, a substantial investment would necessitate Buffett becoming a \"beneficial owner,\" bringing regulatory complexities and constraints.\\n\\nThis scenario is where retail investors can shine. They have the flexibility to invest in small-cap stocks or alternative investments, which, despite their volatility and risks, have greater potential to outperform larger companies over time. This flexibility is a potent advantage, allowing retail investors to tap into high-growth opportunities that are impractical for mammoth funds like Berkshire.\\n\\nWhile Buffett continues to accrue substantial dividends from major names, the chance at high-percentage gains in smaller ventures remains a retail investor’s playing field.\\n\\nDon\\'t Miss:\\n\\nThe 60/40 strategy isn\\'t going to cut it any longer. Major firms like Blackrock are adding these assets to their portfolios to boost returns. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession so it\\'s no surprise that people are turning to high-yield notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\\n\\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS\\' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\\n\\nThis article Warren Buffett Is Expected To Rake In Over $6 Billion In Dividends In The Next Year - Here Are His 3 Biggest Income-Producing Stocks originally appeared on Benzinga.com\\n\\n.\\n\\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

This decline can be attributed to the industry’s cyclical nature, which can easily result in modest swings in semiconductor sales over time.\\n\\nSpecifically, as the leading semiconductor foundry, TSM plays a pivotal role in empowering some of the world’s largest technology giants, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), to breathe life into their cutting-edge chips by harnessing its proprietary technology.\\n\\nNevertheless, whether it’s smartphones, powerful GPUs, or the intricate chips that drive modern automobiles, all of these products, in turn, experience periodic fluctuations in their sales.\\n\\nEvidently, despite TSM’s remarkable 33% surge in Smartphone semiconductor sales, the company together saw a 24% decline in Automotive semiconductor sales for the quarter. This cyclical pattern is illustrated further by the 15% increase in Automotive sales in Q3 of 2022. In my view, TSM’s sales are likely to continue to see swings from here, especially as the ongoing macroeconomic turmoil persists. However, such swings are likely transitory and shouldn’t scare investors away.\\n\\nIn a positive light, the $17.28 billion in Q3 revenues marked a 10.2% increase compared to the previous quarter, signaling a promising rebound. Moreover, the Q4 revenue guidance provided by management, ranging from $18.8 billion to $19.6 billion, suggests further sequential growth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nProfitability Remains Exceptional Despite Challenges\\n\\nTSM’s impressive profitability in Q3 prevailed despite the challenges it encountered on the revenue front. It’s worth noting that companies with cyclical revenues often witness a sharp decline in net income when their top-line figures dip. This is due to their heavy reliance on operational efficiencies driven by economies of scale to drive margins higher.\\n\\nHowever, this is not the case with TSM. Due to its proprietary, irreplaceable technology, TSM enjoys unparalleled pricing power and, thus, industry-leading margins. Consequently, the company not only effortlessly absorbed the modest revenue decline but also once again delivered a highly profitable quarter.\\n\\nIn Q3, TSM’s gross margin stood at 54.3%, its operating margin was 41.7%, and its net profit margin was 38.6%. Although these figures are lower compared to the higher margins of 60.4%, 50.6%, and 45.8%, respectively, from the previous year, they are still remarkable.\\n\\nHow many companies can boast a net income margin of nearly 40% during a quarter marked by declining sales? Certainly not many. Further, profitability is set to remain strong in Q4, with management projecting an operating profit margin between 39.5% and 41.5%.\\n\\nTSM’s Valuation Remains Fair\\n\\nTSM stock remains below its 2021 levels and currently trades at what I believe to be a fair valuation. While the company’s EPS is expected to decline by about 22% to $5.13 this year due to a modest decline in sales and margins, it still implies shares are trading at a reasonable forward P/E of 19.2. Simultaneously, EPS is expected to rebound by about 18% to $6.05 next year, effectively reversing the cyclical pressures of this year. This implies a forward (FY2024) P/E of about 16.2 at the stock’s current levels.\\n\\nGiven TSM’s unique competitive advantage and its resilience in the face of cyclical challenges (particularly when it comes to retaining fantastic margins), the current valuation likely offers an attractive opportunity for potential investors. This is especially true when considering the positive long-term outlook for semiconductor demand, which should serve as a continuous tailwind for revenues and earnings for years to come.\\n\\nIs TSM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nRegarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Taiwan Semiconductor features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $109.60, the average\\xa0Taiwan Semiconductor stock forecast implies 11.4% upside potential.\\n\\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell Taiwan Semiconductor stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\\xa0Gokul Hariharan\\xa0from J.P. Morgan, boasting an average return of 42.2% per rating and an 88% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\\n\\nThe Takeaway\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor has navigated through a challenging quarter, marked by a decline in revenues driven by the inherent cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Nevertheless, the company’s impressive resilience and profitability, with strong margins despite revenue setbacks, are a testament to its unique position in the market.\\n\\nWhile the cyclical nature of the industry may continue to present challenges in the short term, TSM’s recent rebound in revenues and promising Q4 guidance signal a brighter future. The company’s fair valuation, coupled with its enduring competitive advantage and the positive long-term outlook for semiconductor demand, underscore the stock’s bullish investment case.\\n\\nDisclosure', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semiconductor-stock-nyse-tsm-191658288.html', 'symbols': ['2330.TW', 'AAPL.US', 'AMD.US', 'NVDA.US', 'QCOM.US', 'TSFA.F', 'TSFA.STU', 'TSM.US', 'TSMC34.SA', 'TSMN.MX'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.154}}, {'date': '2023-11-16T18:49:15+00:00', 'title': 'Apple Plans to Make It Easier to Text Between iPhones and Androids', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- In a major reversal, Apple Inc. plans to adopt a technological standard next year that will allow text messaging to operate more smoothly between iPhones and Android devices.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nHamas Mastermind Who Tricked Israel Is Top Target in Gaza Tunnels Treasuries Catch a Bid as Stock Rally Hits a Wall: Markets Wrap Biden, Xi Declare Progress After Concluding Four-Hour Summit Xi Says China Seeks to Be Friends With US, Won’t Fight ‘Hot War’ Elon Musk Calls Antisemitic Post on X the ‘Actual Truth’\\n\\nThe company had pushed back on the standard — known as RCS — for more than a year, even as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and others pressed Apple to adopt the technology. RCS, short for rich communication services, is an upgrade over standard SMS and MMS texting that’s backed by the GSM Association.\\n\\nThe technology allows more texting features to be shared over phones on different platforms. For instance, Apple users will be able to text Android users over Wi-Fi and not just via cellular networks.

TGT stock is up 17% as of November 15 following the company’s Q3 financial results that trounced Wall Street forecasts.\\n\\nTarget reported Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.10 versus $1.48 analysts’ expectation. Revenue presented at $25.40 billion compared to the forecast $25.24 billion. TGT said its results got a boost from sales of food and beauty, which offset weaker spending by consumers overall.\\n\\nAlso, the company reported a 14% decline in inventories, as well as lower freight, supply-chain, and delivery expenses. Gross margins rose to 27.4% from 24.7% a year earlier. Additionally, investors like Target’s optimism about its outlook for holiday sales this year. They forecast earnings of $1.90 to $2.60 per share in the current fourth quarter, ahead of the $2.22 expected on Wall Street. To jolt sales during the holidays, Target is offering exclusive merchandise, including thousands of items under $25 each.\\n\\nWhile TGT stock is surging following the company’s Q3 print, the share price remains down 15% on the year, presenting a buy-the-dip opportunity for investors.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Apple store.

AAPL stock has gained 13% since the end of October and is up 51% on the year.\\n\\nHowever, because of peaks and valleys along the way, investors should watch for any further pullbacks to grab shares of Apple. While sales of iPhone and MacBook laptops have slowed, growth in its services business, such as Apple TV, is making up for it.\\n\\nBut even on the hardware side of its business, Apple isn’t taking the sales slowdown lightly. Early indicators show sales of its newest iPhone 15 are brisk. And the company recently announced that new microchips for its personal computers (PCs) and a cheaper MacBook Pro laptop will attract consumers and spur sales. The chips provide faster speeds and have the power needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\\n\\nLong-term, Apple remains a proven winner for investors.

The consumer health unit is a new publicly-traded company called Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE).\\n\\nAlso, driven by strong sales of medical devices and pharma products, JNJ posted Q3 EPS of $2.66, ahead of the $2.52 Wall Street expectation.\\n\\nFurther, July through September revenue rang in at $21.35 billion compared to the forecast $21.04 billion. Also, the drug maker is raising full-year guidance, since it now expects 2023 sales of $83.6 billion to $84 billion, up from $83.2 billion to $84 billion previously. Amidst lawsuit concerns claiming that JNJ’s talc-based products caused cancer which led to several deaths, those products now fall under Kenvue. This takes pressure off JNJ stock.\\n\\nWith the share price of Johnson & Johnson down 16% on the year, grab the opportunity to buy the stock now.

Berkshire\\'s top three holdings remain Apple, Bank of America, and American Express. With more on what this signals about Buffett\\'s shift in strategy, we\\'re joined by Lee Munson, Portfolio Wealth Advisors CIO and president. What does this signal to you about perhaps the next leg of, kind of, prioritization in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio?\\n\\nLEE MUNSON: Well, I think it tells you he likes energy. Because despite the fact that he\\'s been selling Chevron for, I think, four or five quarters in a row, he keeps adding to Occidental Petroleum. I also think it\\'s a good lesson, not so much about what sectors he\\'s in, right? I don\\'t think Warren Buffett really thinks about it in that way.\\n\\nBut it\\'s one thing for sure, he\\'s holding on to his Apple. You know why? Because they\\'re a cash flow machine.\\n\\nHe\\'s holding on to his Bank of America. It\\'s his second largest position. Why is he doing that? Why isn\\'t he trimming that? Well, I\\'ll tell you why, because next year, if we get the bond rally the way everybody expects, their net profit-- their net interest margins are going to go up and everybody\\'s going to be very happy.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSo I think don\\'t necessarily read into the sectors, but just more of where he\\'s concentrated positions and where he\\'s focused. He is focused on energy and I think that that is a key thing going forward. I also think I want to point out that back in August of 2020, he started buying these Japanese trading companies. They\\'re called sogo shoshas and what they do is anything that they can make a buck off of trading from here to there, commodities, software, food, TVs, they do it.\\n\\nAnd you know, I bought a little bit with Buffett because it\\'s a great way to follow a stock is to put five grand into it and see what happens. And my analyst was telling me last night, he\\'s like we\\'ve made a lot of money on these stocks. It\\'s like why didn\\'t we just load the boat? Well, tell me about it.\\n\\nBut we don\\'t get that in the 13F because 13Fs don\\'t show US international positions. So I think the real story is what the 13F doesn\\'t tell us and that is free cash flow moving things from one place to another. And good quality companies, you go out three to five years and you\\'re guaranteed to make money.\\n\\nSo remember, it\\'s all about those Japanese trading things. They\\'re a good valuations. They create free cash flow. It\\'s a classic Buffett move.

Though some in antitrust circles hoped it would be the “trial of the century”, so far the proceedings, which are expected to wrap up shortly, have had little of the Sturm und Drang of the historic Microsoft showdown. The excitement may increase when the verdict is announced next year. For now, no one can confidently predict the outcome because Amit Mehta, the judge, keeps his cards close to his chest. But in the meantime, Schumpeter spoke to someone once lionised by Vanity Fair, a magazine, as “The Man Who Ate Microsoft”. How does David Boies, the government’s lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case, see the similarities and differences between the two antitrust battles?\\n\\nMr Boies makes clear that he has not been present in the District of Columbia courtroom to witness the Google trial. At 82, he is still busy, including serving as counsel on two pending cases against Google (which suggests he may not be an impartial observer). Yet he says media coverage of the trial is sufficient to form some opinions, and two things stand out. First, like Microsoft, Google came to court with a history of innovation and consumer success, effectively saying “Trust us, we know what’s best for consumers.” Second, the DOJ may not have challenged that trustworthiness forcefully enough. “During the Microsoft case, even if you were a casual observer, you were constantly confronted with attacks on Microsoft’s credibility. I haven’t seen that in the press,” he says. He is not alone. Broadly, the feeling is that the DOJ has not yet dealt Google a spectacular knockout blow.\\n\\nMr Boies has had some setbacks in an otherwise illustrious career, including representing The Weinstein Company, co-founded by Harvey Weinstein, a former Hollywood producer jailed for rape. But when it comes to antitrust, he has played starring roles in two trials that have helped shape the tech landscape for 50 years. He first led IBM’s successful defence against an antitrust case in the 1960s. Though the personal-computer giant won, it was so rattled by years of investigations, he says, that it gave Microsoft, then an upstart, carte blanche to sell its Windows software widely, rather than insisting on exclusivity. Microsoft subsequently leapfrogged IBM. Mr Boies’ role in the IBM case drew the attention of the DOJ’s prosecutors, who recruited him years later to take the lead in their anti-monopoly battle against Microsoft. The government’s victory in that case may have so distracted Microsoft that it helped Google steal a march in the internet-search business.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhether Google is similarly hobbled in the future will depend, above all, on an issue that is at the crux of the DOJ’s case. That is the annual payments that Google provides to Apple, maker of the iPhone, other smartphone-makers such as Samsung, who use Alphabet’s Android operating system, and providers of browsers such as Mozilla, to ensure it is their default search engine. The amounts are staggering. During the trial it emerged that Google’s payments were as high as $26bn in 2021. The New York Times reported that $18bn of that went to Apple. This week, an economist testifying in Google’s defence disclosed that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenues it earns from search advertising via Apple’s Safari browser, suggesting it generates advertising revenues of $50bn from Safari alone. The DOJ argues that these payments prevent competitors from challenging Google, and that because they are generated from digital-advertising revenues that Google shares with the recipients, the latter have less incentive to offer competing search products. It likens the deals to Microsoft’s practice in the 1990s of bunding its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system, making rival browsers such as Netscape harder to install. Mr Boies, who zeroed in on bundling in the Microsoft case, says it is not only harmful to competitors. It hurts consumers, because it deprives them of choice.\\n\\nGoogle rejects that claim. It says that default search engines can be changed with a couple of clicks. They are not sticky. For instance, the top search globally on Microsoft’s Bing, a rival, is “Google”, suggesting users willingly switch to their preferred platform. Nor are they exclusive; Bing, too, pays Apple for space on Safari. Google argues that its default payments help lower the cost of phones and other devices to consumers. It says its success in search comes from innovation, not from an illegal monopoly.\\n\\nWill that narrative prevail? Mr Boies says an antitrust trial is part “morality play”, in which the successful prosecutor should seek to destroy the defendant’s credibility. At the start of the Google trial, the DOJ’s lead lawyer, Kenneth Dintzer, raised the trustworthiness question, accusing Google of trying to conceal documents under attorney-client privilege and turning off the history function on group chats. But on the witness stand weeks later, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s boss, proved unflappable. He demonstrated none of the brittle defensiveness Bill Gates, then the boss of Microsoft, had showed during his depositions.\\n\\nSearch and destroy\\n\\nSo the verdict will come down to how Judge Mehta views the default payments. His decision may rest on whether he buys the DOJ’s argument that they foreclose competition, or Google’s defence that they benefit consumers by improving the product. Defeat will cost both sides a lot. If Google loses few believe it would be broken up, but the status of default payments would be thrown into doubt. If deprived of Google’s cash, Apple might build a rival search engine. A loss for the DOJ would be yet another setback for the Biden administration’s efforts to move antitrust cases beyond a focus on consumer welfare. It might try to console itself that a loss would prompt Congress to write new laws to rein in big tech.

We will also discuss current burnout levels at workplaces. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with Best Work-Life Balance in the World.\\n\\nThe global health and wellness industry is poised to hit a valuation of $5.3 trillion in 2023 which is a major increase from the $4.9 trillion reported in 2022, as indicated in the Health and Wellness Global Market Report for 2023. The growth in the industry’s value also sheds light upon the growing importance people attach to their well-being. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic sped up the adoption of remote and hybrid work setups, bringing into focus the crucial concept of work-life balance. Surprisingly, nearly half of those surveyed by the research firm Gitnux revealed that a poor work-life balance was adversely affecting their family relationships. What\\'s even more concerning is that 37% of respondents mentioned it was impacting their physical and emotional health. While most jobs these days have added to the burnout levels of employees, some come with an excellent balance.\\n\\nOne interesting finding in the recent Gallup survey was that 33% of women reported experiencing burnout in 2023, while the figure for men stood at 25%. This disparity in burnout rates influences what individuals seek in their next job. Notably, 69% of women consider work-life balance and personal well-being as key factors in their job selection, compared to 58% of men. Additionally, 58% of women prioritize job stability and security, while 62% aim to find roles that allow them to utilize their strengths. Both men and women (59%) are interested in jobs that largely boost their income or benefits. Moreover, The \"lazy girl job\" trend on Tiktok has also attracted considerable attention to lower-stress, well-paid positions for better work-life balance, especially for women.\\n\\nWhat Does Work-Life Balance Actually Mean?\\n\\nWork-life balance is the essentially an equilibrium between an individual\\'s professional commitments and their personal life which include their family, leisure, and self-care. Hence, having work-life balance means that one can manage work-related demands without sacrificing one\\'s physical and mental well-being, relationships, or leisure activities.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe countries with the worst work-life balance often struggle with extended working hours, limited vacation days, and high levels of job-related stress, leading to a strain on personal life. For example, in Mexico, 27% of workers are engaged in extended working hours at a paid job, which is way higher than the OECD average of 10%. It is also interesting to note that it is 33% of men that are involved in very long working hours, as opposed to 17% of women.\\n\\nIn contrast, countries with the most work-life balance have shorter workweeks, generous vacation policies, and supportive family-friendly policies. For example, in Sweden, parents have the right to a total of 480 days of paid parental leave upon the birth or adoption of a child. If there are two parents, each of them is eligible for 240 of those days.\\n\\nCompanies with a High Work-Life Balance\\n\\nOne of the companies that promote a high work-life balance for their employees is Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO). They offer competitive benefits packages that cater to employees and their families, including health and wellness programs, preventive medical coverage, flexible spending accounts, and access to personal health advocates. Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) also provides paid disability plans and support for family planning, including surrogacy and fertility treatments. Additionally, they offer travel benefits for accessing medical services not available within a 60-mile radius.\\n\\nFor parents, Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) provides paid time off to attend to emergency care and school activities, and thus, helps one prioritize family needs. Additionally, employees can enjoy up to 12 weeks of full-pay family and medical leave, further supporting their work-life balance.\\n\\nAltria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) is also one of the best stocks to buy for income.\\n\\nOn the other hand, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has addressed disparities in mental health and work-life balance for women of color through a $1.3 million investment in Fresh Start Women\\'s Foundation. The initiative acknowledges that women, especially women of color, experience higher rates of depression and mental health challenges. These challenges often go unaddressed due to barriers such as cultural stigmas, high costs, and a lack of therapists from different communities.\\n\\nMoreover, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has also earned a commendable rating of 3.9 out of 5 stars based on over 18,000 employee reviews on Indeed.com. Employees praise the company for its strong work-life balance with a rating of 3.7 out of 5 and 3.8 out of 5 for competitive salary and benefits. With JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)’s inclusive work culture,\\xa0 the company continues to\\xa0 emphasize on learning opportunities and internal mobility for its employees.\\n\\nIt is also worth highlighting that in the light of recent event, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)’s CEO Jamie Dimon addressed the Israel-Hamas war with a companywide memo. The bank condemned terrorism and hatred and also expressed sympathy for the tragic events resulting from the conflict. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) proved their dedication for equity and inclusion by denouncing discrimination based on religion or ethnic background. The bank assured its employees of safety, both physically and emotionally, and encouraged them to utilize support resources. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) pledged an initial $1 million philanthropic contribution eligible for employee matching to assist in the humanitarian crisis. 30 Countries with Best Work-Life Balance in the World\\n\\nA smiling couple walking hand-in-hand out of a modern insurance office, illustrating the company\\'s commitment to its customers.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo list the countries with the best work-life balance in the world, we have utilized Remote’s Global Life-Work Balance Index.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business', 'content': \"Key Insights\\n\\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Apple's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions 40% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\\n\\nIf you want to know who really controls Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 55% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\\n\\nLast week’s 3.1% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 27%.\\n\\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Apple, beginning with the chart below.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple  ownership-breakdown\\n\\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\\n\\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\\n\\nWe can see that Apple does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Apple's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\\n\\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Apple. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.7% of common stock, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\\n\\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\\n\\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\\n\\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\\n\\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\\n\\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.8b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\\n\\nGeneral Public Ownership\\n\\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Apple. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\\n\\nPublic Company Ownership\\n\\nIt appears to us that public companies own 5.9% of Apple. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.\\n\\nNext Steps:\\n\\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Apple that you should be aware of before investing here.\\n\\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\\n\\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Elsewhere, President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agree to re-open military communications after a crucial face-to-face meeting, and the U.S. Senate approves a stop-gap spending bill that will almost certainly avert a looming partial government shutdown.\\n\\n1. Futures point broadly lower\\n\\nU.S. stock futures edged lower on Thursday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, following a positive close in the prior session.\\n\\nBy 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures shed 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 31 points or 0.2%.\\n\\nThe main indices on Wall Street ended Wednesday in the green, fueled in part by the largest monthly drop in wholesale prices since 2020 in October. The figure, which came a day after data showed that consumer prices grew at a slower-than-anticipated rate last month, added to optimism that the Federal Reserve\\'s long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes may have peaked.\\n\\nAt the closing bell, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.5%, the benchmark S&P 500 had risen by 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had climbed by 0.1%.\\n\\n2. Walmart earnings ahead\\n\\nWalmart is set to deliver its latest quarterly results on Thursday, with investors keen for more details on how the retail giant sees trading evolving heading into the key holiday shopping season.\\n\\nTotal U.S. comparable sales, excluding gasoline, are estimated to rise by 3.35% in the third quarter, while adjusted earnings per share are seen at $1.52, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the company is projected to forecast adjusted income per share of $1.66 in its current quarter, up from $1.53 in the corresponding period last year. Analysts will also likely want to hear more about the holiday outlook from Walmart executives, particularly after comments from rival Target on Wednesday pointed to lingering pressures on U.S. consumers from trends like higher interest rates and lower savings despite signs of easing inflation.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nUnlike some of its big-box peers, Walmart has largely been able to weather a downturn in spending on big-ticket items by leaning on its reputation for offering low costs on essentials like groceries. Same-store sales in the U.S. jumped by 6.4% in the second quarter, topping expectations, while its international unit posted its best three-month performance since at least 2016.\\n\\n3. Biden and Xi meet face-to-face\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to re-establish military communications following a crucial face-to-face meeting on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe two leaders spoke for roughly four hours at a time when tensions between both sides over a range of issues have been perceived to be high. It was only the second time that Biden has spoken in-person with Xi since taking office in 2021.\\n\\nFollowing the gathering, Biden said that China had agreed to return to \"direct, open, clear\" communication, which had been closed since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. U.S. officials have speculated on when China may attempt to invade Taiwan, which it claims as a part of its territory, although Xi reportedly denied that any such plans were in place.\\n\\nHowever, a senior U.S. official told Reuters that Xi said the status of the island is the \"most potentially dangerous issue\" facing U.S.-China ties. Biden stressed to Xi that Washington wanted to see \"peace and stability\" in the region, Reuters added, citing the official.\\n\\nLater on Wednesday, Xi told a room full of some of America\\'s leading corporate figures -- including Tesla\\'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk and Apple\\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Tim Cook -- that China and its \"super-large economy\" are ready to \"be a partner and friend of the U.S.\"\\n\\n4. Senate passes stop-gap spending measure\\n\\nThe U.S. Senate has voted in favor of a stop-gap plan that will likely avoid a partial government shutdown.\\n\\nFollowing a tally of 87-11 in the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress, the measure, which was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this week, now heads to President Biden\\'s desk for his signature.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described the outcome of talks over the short-term spending proposal \"a great outcome for the American people\" that will avert cuts to \"vital\" federal programs.\\n\\nThe bill received wide backing from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, marking a shift away from the political brinkmanship seen in recent debates over government spending plans. But it remains uncertain if the detente will also be seen when a fresh funding deadline arrives early next year.\\n\\nPolitical battles have already exacerbated concerns on Wall Street over America\\'s fiscal condition, with Moody\\'s (NYSE:MCO) last week citing polarization in Washington as one of the reasons for its decision to lower its U.S. credit rating outlook to \"negative\" from \"stable.\"\\n\\n5.

The S&P 400 Semiconductor index is down 11% in 2023 but off by nearly a third from its highs early on. Investors were expecting another down year on top of the drubbing chip stocks took in 2022, but a turnaround is forming. This led us to creating this list of semiconductor stocks to buy.\\n\\nConsumer spending remains strong despite rising inflation and falling personal computer shipments. Companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn (OTCMKTS:FXCOF) saw profits rise 11% from last year beating analyst expectations. Smartphone sell-through volumes rose 2% sequentially even if they were down 8% year over year. Canalys says the global smartphone slowdown is almost over. The market only dropped 1% in the third quarter.\\n\\nYet the situation remains volatile. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it is cutting 180 jobs in its gaming division and video game engine maker Unity Software (NYSE:U) said layoffs are in the works. But artificial intelligence (AI) still drives growth higher. All eyes are on Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) third-quarter earnings report next week.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nSo sifting through semiconductor stocks to buy becomes a more intensive process. Right now, though, is an opportune time because of their discounted valuations. What follows are three of the best supercharged chip stocks waiting to be bought.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nFoundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) gave the market an early preview of the turnaround brewing in the industry. It singlehandedly lifted the chip market when it reported blowout October sales numbers. Revenue for the month rocketed 35% higher from the previous quarter!\\n\\nNvidia’s demand for AI chips undoubtedly helped push sales higher (TSM is Nvidia’s chip supplier), but AI only represents 6% of total revenue. However, TSM anticipates customers will continuously add on more AI features to their chip orders as time progresses so expect that figure to grow.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIndications of a smartphone rebound were also present. Segment revenue jumped 33% higher and accounts for 39% of revenue. High-performance computing was also up 6% while Internet of Things rose 24%. Although automotive and data centers were the two segments that declined, they represent just 5% and 2%, respectively, of total revenue.\\n\\nAlthough Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock is up 29% this year, it’s still offered at an attractive 16 times next year’s earnings. If the cyclical semi industry is ready to roar, you’ll want to climb aboard the TSM train now.\\n\\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\\n\\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\\n\\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is vital to semiconductor industry even though it’s not a chipmaker itself. It is an equipment supplier to the manufacturers. It sells critical tools such as extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) photolithography machines, immersion systems, and other types of lithography equipment.\\n\\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of EUV machines, a valuable monopoly when chipmakers want to produce ever more advanced chips. Among its customers are TSM, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung, the three of whom account for an estimated 80% of revenue.\\n\\nBecause Taiwan is a potential flashpoint on the geopolitical stage, there is some risk to its business (and to TSM’s, naturally). Customer concentration can’t be lightly dismissed either. Yet there are long-term industry tailwinds that should keep driving ASML forward. Investors also have good visibility into ASML’s revenue.\\n\\nWall Street is upbeat and expects the equipment supplier to grow earnings at a compounded rate of 22% annually. With a dividend that yields a modest 1% annually, investors will want to stock up on ASML shares now.\\n\\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\\n\\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is arguably one of the better values among its peers today. The near-field communication chipmaker trades at just 12 times earnings estimates and 18x the free cash flow (FCF) it generates. Its growth potential lies in the proliferation of smart electric cars. NXP’s chips allow cars to communicate with one another and the environment around them. The automotive segment accounts for 57% of revenue.\\n\\nIt’s also the source of the biggest risk. High interest rates are dampening EV demand. Although sales are still growing, the rate of growth is slowing. Ford (NYSE:F) is cutting one shift at the plant making its Lightning F-150 pickup truck. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology, also known as CATL, the world’s largest EV battery maker, recently reported revenue grew 11%, its weakest quarter in two years.\\n\\nEven so, EV sales in the third quarter topped 300,000 vehicles in the U.S. for the first time. They were up 14% in the European Union in September and 22% higher in China.\\n\\nFortunately, it’s not just EVs where NXP’s chips are used. The semiconductor stock provides chips for various advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle networking, body, chassis, powertrain, and safety applications. As the auto market returns, NXP Semiconductors will be a chip stock you should own.

Despite concerns over high interest rates and inflation, Kettner believes that the strong performance of equities, particularly in the consumer discretionary (XLY) and tech (XLK) sectors, is a positive sign for investors.\\n\\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) announced that its Pratt & Whitney unit secured a sustainment contract worth up to $870M for TF33 engines, which power the B-52 Stratofortress and E-3 Sentry. This contract underscores the ongoing demand for maintenance and support services in the aerospace sector.\\n\\nTudor Investment, the hedge fund founded by Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio), has made several adjustments to its portfolio, including new positions in Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN), AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), and Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK). The firm also increased its stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Chevron (CVX), while closing out or reducing positions in other companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) unveiled its first two in-house processors at its annual Ignite conference, signaling its intention to compete with semiconductor giants and reduce reliance on external suppliers. The Maia 100 chip, focused on AI workloads, and the Cobalt 100 chip, aimed at cloud computing, represent Microsoft\\'s push into the hardware space.\\n\\nThe Federal Trade Commission has issued a warning to the American Beverage Association regarding the use of social media influencers to promote the safety of aspartame without proper disclosures. This action reflects the FTC\\'s commitment to ensuring transparency in advertising and endorsements.\\n\\nAlbertsons (ACI) and Kroger (KR) are expected to file substantial compliance with the FTC\\'s second request concerning their proposed merger.

Given the benchmark\\'s market cap distribution which allows larger stocks to contribute more to the index\\'s movements, the S&P 500 has added about 19% this year. Research from Goldman Sachs shows the S&P 500 has never been this top heavy, which is leading to gains in seven stocks driving the major average higher.

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the richest and most well known hedge fund investors in the world, then take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions.\\n\\nKen Fisher is one of the richest hedge fund investors in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, Mr. Fisher is worth a cool $6.8 billion as of November 2023, making him one of the wealthiest 500 people in the world with a population of billions. Mr. Fisher is also one of the few hedge fund bosses who is a prolific writer, and while these days he doesn't write regularly, he nevertheless shares crucial insight into the finance industry and the economy on his investment firm's YouTube channel.\\n\\nMr. Fisher's story in the hedge fund industry has seen him turn a mere hundreds of dollars into a multi billion dollar firm. According to Insider Monkey's research, Fisher Investments' investment portfolio was worth $176 billion as of September 2023. This makes Fisher Investments one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and one whose portfolio is worth more than the central bank holdings of most countries. Diving deeper into Mr. Fisher's investment portfolio, it marked a small $4 billion drop over its Q2 2023 value of $180 billion. However, annually, the portfolio has grown by 32% over 2022's third quarter since back then Fisher Investment's investment portfolio was worth $133 billion.\\n\\nA cursory look at the investment climate in 2023 shares some insight into why Mr. Fisher has grown his holdings even as the stock market remains uncertain about the future. 2023 has been the year for technology stocks as the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has made investors flock in droves to big ticket technology firms such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Fisher Investments also pays close attention to technology companies, and its investments during the third quarter of 2023 saw the four biggest investment stakes being the biggest technology companies in the world.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n2023 has been a busy year for Mr. Fisher and his firm, in spite of the turmoil in the stock market. This is because in March, Fisher Investments announced that it would move its headquartered to Dallas, Texas from Washington. This decision came after the Washington Supreme Court upheld a 2021 law that deducted a 7% tax from sales of stocks or bonds with profits higher than $250,000.\\n\\nShifting gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen all eyes remain on the Federal Reserve. The Fed's fight to bring down inflation has seen it exert significant pain on investors through high interest rates. On this front, a highly anticipated inflation report for October is believed to set the tone for the Fed's decisions later this year. Based on preliminary market chatter, it appears that investors are expecting inflation to further drop, and consequently limit the stimulus for the central bank to increase rates by 25 basis points. Economists expect inflation to drop to 3.3% in October over the 3.7% in September, while the Fed's preferred inflation reading, core inflation, is expected to stay at 4.10%.\\n\\nHeading into the latest inflation data release, consumer sentiment in the U.S. has started to drop. According to the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, consumer confidence dropped to a six month low of 60.4 for November 2023. At the same time, consumer sentiment about inflation a year from now touched a seven month high, partially influenced by the brief turmoil in the oil market after fresh conflict erupted between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East.\\n\\nSwitching back to Mr. Fisher, these days a 'goldilocks economy' is on his mind. This economy is characterized by moderate growth and low inflation, and it has been on several investors' minds as the U.S. GDP continues to grow despite rapid interest rate hikes. So what does Mr. Fisher think about this? Well, he outlined in a recent video:\\n\\nThe fact that we're near goldilocks world, and surprises in the real economy keep trending on average, not perfectly so, not a 100% so, better than people expected. That, we should hit that goldilock world in a world that doesn't expect that, and recognize its potential as a goldilocks, for only about three days, yes I think that should warm your heart. I think this speaks further to this reality. In December of last year, we had a corrective downturn inside this bull market that lasted a little over a month. In February-March, of this year, we had another one. Recently, we've had another one! In the period of August-September. And it would appear this one to look almost identical to those prior two. And I encourage you just to go back and look at a chart of the last year at some online website that allows you to do that let's say for let's say the S&P 500. And see how similar this period looks to those periods before the bull market ramped back up.\\xa0 I think this is the corrective phase as the wall of worry that bull markets legendarily climb, reasserts itself to lower expectations. It's the corrective phase, the pause that refreshes if you will before the launch of the next phase upwards in this bull market.\\n\\nSo, as he expects the market to do well in the future, it's even more important to take a look at Ken Fisher's top stock picks. We did so today and discovered that the top three stocks in Fisher Investments' Q3 2023 portfolio are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most widely followed and coveted stock market indexes in the world, then take a look at 5 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 is one of the most coveted stock indexes in the world. Securing a place in the index is highly sought after, and it adds a semblance of credibility to a company that helps its shares attract more investor capital. The index is run and managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), an American financial services firm headquartered in New York, New York.\\n\\nIt's not easy to secure a place in the S&P 500. S&P Global lists down a set of criteria that must be followed for inclusion. For instance, a non American company with a primary listing outside the U.S. cannot be a part of the S&P 500. At the same time, its market capitalization should be greater than $14.5 billion, which removes small cap stocks from consideration. Additionally, a firm that seeks to be added to the S&P 500 must be profitable, and there must be significant volume for its shares as well as adequate liquidity.\\n\\nThis collection of the 500 top companies in America often serves as a benchmark for the broader market as well as the economy. Thousands of investors eagerly pour over the S&P 500 index each day to try to decipher the sentiment of market participants and determine whether there is an opportunity to make a profit. Year to date in 2023 so far, the index has returned 15.46% and its performance is a reflection of investor sentiment surrounding the American economy and monetary policy. 2023 has been quite a roller coaster ride for the S&P 500 too. The index started the year at a reading of 3,824 and for the first half of 2023, it posted returns of 16.3% by closing at 4,450 points at June end. However, the index dipped to 4,117 in late October to reverse all of its gains made since late May. However, the tail end of 2024 is proving to be much better than the third quarter, as currently, the index is trading at 4,415 points to recuperate some of its losses since June.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn fact, November has been quite a month for the S&P 500. It has seen the index post eight consecutive days of daily returns to beat a two year old record. These shifts are reflective of market sentiment, which has relied on the Federal Reserve for most of the past 18 months. This sentiment is shifting during the fourth quarter, with investors believing that interest rates are likely to start coming down. This is despite the fact that Fed officials have maintained that additional interest rate hikes are not off the table, but investors believe that the economy cannot withstand any substantial increases in interest rates particularly due to their impact on the bond market. However, there are still a lot of jitters within the market, since Fed Chair Jerome Powell's latest comments about the potential of interest rates being insufficient to bring down inflation ended up sapping the record setting rallies of the S&P 500 and other indexes. Yet, at the same time, these rallies are also indicative of the potential gains that these indexes can post if there is sufficient evidence to believe that not only are rate hikes a thing of the past but that rates will soon start to drop.\\n\\nShifting gears to focus on the individual components of the S&P 500 index, its five largest constituent firms in terms of market capitalization are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). This shows the absolute dominance of big technology firms on both the American economy and the S&P500 as well. The latest re balancing of the S&P 500 took place in October 2023 and saw two new companies, namely Hubbell Incorporated (NYSE:HUBB) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), added to the list of elite stocks. But these additions aren't permanent though, as data from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that since 2015, more than a third of the stocks that were part of the index have been replaced.\\n\\nSo, even as the S&P 500 shakes things up quite frequently, some companies, such as 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) have been a part of it for decades.

However, the QCOM stock’s disappointing earnings results this year, coupled with one of its biggest markets, China, moving to develop a vibrant domestic semiconductor industry, have made me reconsider.\\n\\nQCOM’s long-term share potential is definitely in jeopardy. Below are three reasons long-term holders should quit Qualcomm before it’s too late.\\n\\nThis year’s revenue and earnings growth have been dismal\\n\\nLet’s start this analysis by engaging with Qualcomm’s year-to-date financial performance. First-quarter revenues were a complete disappointment, but those following consumer electronics trends could have probably predicted these developments.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nQualcomm reported a YoY revenue decline of 12%. Additionally, net income plummeted 34% YoY. Much of this decline had been attributed to falling demand for Qualcomm’s smartphone hardware, including system-on-a-chip (SoC) and wireless products.\\n\\nThe subsequent second and third quarters were not any different. Revenue declined 17% and 23% during the second and third quarters. Net income for both periods also suffered a catastrophic drop.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is consumers spent a lot of cash on electronic products during the pandemic. This, and higher inflation hurting consumer sentiment, has led to Qualcomm’s dismal financial results this year. As we will see, this is not the end of the hardware company’s concerns.\\n\\nSmartphone demand will likely continue to decline\\n\\nThe decline in smartphone demand is not some mere aberration from which investors could hope for a recovery. This trend has been around since before the pandemic. If any analyst glanced at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounts for nearly a quarter of Qualcomm’s revenue and is its largest customer, these trends would have been apparent.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the amount of iPhone and iPad units Apple sold declined significantly YoY due to diminishing consumer interest in mobile devices. At that time, Huawei was also making significant strides in taking away market share from both Apple and Samsung. After that quarter, Apple reported several other quarters of revenue decline or sluggish, single-digit growth.\\n\\nQualcomm’s revenue is derived from selling hardware to create various handsets. Still, as demand for these continues to stall, investors can only expect the same from Qualcomm unless significant investment is made to diversify its revenue streams.\\n\\nQualcomm may lose more of its China market share\\n\\nRecent news that\\xa0Apple\\xa0will continue using Qualcomm’s wireless modems until 2026 spurred optimism regarding Qualcomm’s future prospects. However, events in China have made me feel otherwise. In early September, Huawei – China’s telecom, cloud, and consumer electronics champion – quietly released the Huawei Mate 60 Pro, which features a 7-nanometer system on a chip (SoC) designed and manufactured in China.\\n\\nAlthough the die size is technically a few generations behind what the\\xa0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is capable of manufacturing, this represented a surprising breakthrough for the world’s second-largest economy.\\n\\nMoreover, the wireless modem on the Huawei Mate 60 Pro also reached fast 5G speeds. This event, in and of itself, should worry any Qualcomm investor. Put slightly differently, if Huawei can design a powerful wireless model independently, imagining a world where other Chinese smartphone OEMs, including Oppo and Xiaomi, begin using made-in-China modems is not difficult.\\n\\nIn this case, Qualcomm would lose a significant market and be forced to pivot elsewhere or fall into obscurity.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\\xa0Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

Neither appears to be a current Berkshire investment.\\n\\nIn other third-quarter sales, Berkshire finished exiting video game maker Activision Blizzard, which was bought by Microsoft last month, and reduced its holdings in life insurer Globe Life.\\n\\nBerkshire also shed about two-thirds of its stake in Markel Group, a notable change given that some investors have in recent years viewed the insurance and investment company as a \"mini-Berkshire.\"\\n\\nBuffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965.\\n\\nHis conglomerate also owns dozens of businesses including the Geico car insurer, BNSF railroad, energy and industrial companies, and consumer brands such as Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See\\'s Candies.

Other times he came across as a professor explaining complex subjects to the trial's 10-person jury located just a few feet from a podium Pichai was allowed to use because he has difficulty sitting for prolonged periods.\\n\\nEpic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, is trying to convince the jury that a Google Play payment processing system that collects a 15% to 30% commission from in-app purchases is illegally hurting consumers and software developers. Google collects those commissions, according to Epic, by using its market muscle to thwart competing Android app stores — a strategy that drives up prices and discourages innovation.\\n\\nIt echoes a previous case that Epic brought against Apple, the iPhone maker that is alternately being depicted as Google foe and ally in this trial.\\n\\nPichai's latest testimony came 15 days after he traveled to Washington D.C. to take the stand in a separate antitrust trial revolving around the U.S. Justice Department's allegations that Google has stifled competition and innovation by abusing the power of the dominant search engine that launched the company in 1998.\\n\\nAlthough the two trials are unfolding on opposite ends of the country and are delving into different parts of a company that investors value at $1.7 trillion, they are touching upon at least two common issues — Google's immense power and its unusual relationship with Apple, an even bigger tech powerhouse.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA key part of Google's defense against that allegations that its Play Store is running an illegal monopoly on Android apps hinges on the assertion that the company faces major competition from Apple's iPhone, mobile operating system and app store.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department's case against Google in Washington is focused largely on deals that the company negotiated with Apple to ensure that Google's search engine automatically fields queries entered on iPhones and Apple's Safari browser.\\n\\nAfter Monday testimony from an expert witness in the Washington antitrust trial revealed Google shared 36% of its ad revenue from Safari search queries with Apple in 2021, Pichai was forced to confirm the figure Tuesday in San Francisco under often combative questioning by Epic lawyer Lauren Moskowitz.\\n\\nThings got so tense that before recessing for a short break, U.S. District Judge James Donato described the back-and-forth between Epic's lawyer and Pichai as a “rocking 75 minutes.”\\n\\nBefore the testimony began, Donato had granted Moskowitz's request to disclose the precise amount of money that Google paid Apple in 2021 over objections from both Google and Apple lawyers, but she never got that specific.\\n\\nInstead, Moskowitz got Pichai to acknowledge that Apple received the bulk of the $26.3 billion that Google paid for all of its 2021 deals that locked in its search engine as the automatic handler of queries on smartphones and web browsers. Analysts have estimated Apple's annual take from Google to be in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion.\\n\\nMoskowitz also pointed out that Apple's 36% cut from Google's search ad revenue in the Safari browser was more than twice the 16% rate paid to Samsung, the biggest seller of Android smartphones. That point seemed to be aimed at painting Apple as one of Google's biggest business partners, rather than a major competitor.\\n\\nAlthough he sometimes seemed to be caught off balance by Moskowitz’s aggressive questioning, Pichai never wavered from his insistence that Google and Android compete “fiercely” with Apple and the iPhone — a rivalry he asserted has given consumers more choices and driven down prices.\\n\\n“We enable more affordable smartphones,” Pichai said of Android, which Google gives away to Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers for free in exchange for putting the company's search engine and other services, such as its Play Store, on the devices. That, Pichai added, “is very different from what Apple does.”\\n\\nApple's specter looms over the Play Store in other ways too, given Epic Games already has lost in a similar 2021 trial that targeted the payment system for the iPhone app store.\\n\\nAlthough a federal judge sided with Apple on most fronts in that trial, the outcome opened one potential crack in the digital fortress that the company has built around the iPhone.\\n\\nThe judge and an appeals court both determined Apple should allow apps to provide links to other payment options, a change that could undermine the commissions that both Apple and Google collect on digital purchases made within a mobile app. Apple is appealing that part of the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nEvidence submitted during Pichai's Tuesday testimony showed just how lucrative the Play Store has been for Google. During the first half of 2020, for instance, the Play Store generated an operating profit of $4.4 billion.\\n\\nSteered by questioning from a Google lawyer, Pichai pointed out that figure didn't account for the billions of dollars that the company spends on the Android operating system that ensures people have other smartphone options than then iPhone. He also pointed out that 97% of software developers with apps in Google Play don't pay any fees at all because they either don't sell digital goods or don't generate enough revenue to reach the threshold that triggers the commissions.\\n\\n“The way we designed Google Play is we do well only when developers do well,” Pichai said.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-returns-231559898.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.982, 'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.069}}, {'date': '2023-11-14T22:48:00+00:00', 'title': 'These 3 Mega-Cap Tech Companies Are Cash-Generating Machines', 'content': 'Companies with strong cash-generating abilities boast a highly flexible nature, as they’re better equipped to weather a potential economic downturn, can capitalize on growth opportunities, and provide investors with a sense of safety.\\n\\nAfter all, cash is king.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to stacking cash, mega-cap tech players – Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and Apple AAPL – fit the criteria nicely.

Analysts have been particularly bullish for its current fiscal year, with the $5.74 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up 13% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nThe Google parent posted quarterly free cash flow of $22.6 billion in its latest quarter, climbing 40% from the same period last year.

He largely stuck to one-word answers but was occasionally admonished by Epic Games\\' attorney for straying beyond simple answers.\\n\\nPichai, in examination by a Google attorney, denied he had ever tried to keep any document hidden from a lawsuit. He said he used the term \"privileged\" on documents to indicate \"confidential\" not necessarily subject to attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nBut he later acknowledged, under questioning from the judge, that since 2008 Google largely left it to employees to determine if their chats could be relevant to litigation. He said that policy was revised recently.\\n\\nEpic Games has alleged in its lawsuit that app store policies amount to an illegal monopoly and have caused consumers to pay artificially high prices. The company wants it to be easier for Google Play users to access third-party app stores and additional payment processors for in-app purchases.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor its part, Google has said changing its systems would cause its Android-based app store to be less secure and damage its ability to compete with Apple. Epic’s similar lawsuit against Apple resulted in a ruling largely that was mostly favorable to Apple – both companies appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nEpic filed the case against Google in 2020 after “Fortnite” was removed from the app store after the Cary, North Carolina, company enabled customers to pay it directly, circumventing Google’s payment systems, which allow it to take a percentage of each transaction.\\n\\nIf jurors find for Epic it could radically alter the app store business, in which Google and Apple exert exclusive control of what apps are available to consumers and take a cut of roughly 30% of in-app purchases and paid downloads.\\n\\nGoogle has settled claims over its app store with dating app maker Match Group and from U.S. consumers and U.S. states. Google is also facing an antitrust trial over the U.S. government’s allegations about its search dominance and is expected to have to defend itself at trial next year over its policies on digital advertising.\\n\\nSeparately, Pichai confirmed that Google pays Apple 36% of search revenue on iOS in order to be the default search engine, a figure that leaked on Monday in Google\\'s antitrust trial under way in federal court in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThe payments to Apple have been central to the Justice Department\\'s case.\\n\\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco Editing by Matthew Lewis)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-alphabet-ceo-play-store-213443811.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.475, 'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.069}}, {'date': '2023-11-14T21:05:51+00:00', 'title': 'Market Today: Solar Stocks Shine and Roku Rises on Takeover Speculation', 'content': \"In a notable development, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) experienced a surge in its share price following commentary from investment firm DA Davidson, which highlighted the company as a potential acquisition target.

Its flagship product, ARIKAYCE, is a significant advancement in the treatment of Mycobacterium Avium Complex lung disease. Despite a market capitalization of $3.51 billion and a stock price of $24.565, Insmed operates at a loss, as indicated by a PE Percentage of 0.00. GuruFocus deems the stock as modestly undervalued with a GF Value of $27.57 and a price to GF Value ratio of 0.89. The stock has experienced a year-to-date increase of 28.08%, although it has seen a decline of 1.98% since the reported transaction.\\n\\nStory continues Vanguard Group Inc Adds Shares in Insmed Inc\\n\\nImpact of Vanguard's Trade on Its Portfolio\\n\\nThe recent acquisition by Vanguard Group Inc has a minimal immediate impact on its vast portfolio, given the 0.01% position size. However, the 10.07% holding in Insmed's outstanding shares is a testament to Vanguard's confidence in the biopharmaceutical firm's potential. This trade aligns with Vanguard's investment philosophy, which includes a significant focus on the healthcare sector, and may be indicative of a long-term strategic position.\\n\\nMarket Context and Insmed's Valuation\\n\\nInsmed Inc's current market valuation and stock price dynamics offer an interesting context for Vanguard's investment. The company's modestly undervalued status according to GuruFocus metrics, combined with a GF Value Rank of 6/10, suggests a potential for growth. However, the stock's negative Gain Percent since the transaction and a significant drop since its IPO highlight the volatility and risks inherent in the biotechnology industry.\\n\\nFinancial and Growth Prospects of Insmed\\n\\nInsmed's financial health and growth prospects are areas of concern, with a Financial Strength rank of 2/10 and a Profitability Rank of 1/10. The company's GF Score of 47/100 indicates poor future performance potential, and its Piotroski F-Score of 4 suggests average financial health. These metrics, combined with a negative Altman Z score, underscore the speculative nature of this investment.\\n\\nBiotechnology Sector and Industry Analysis\\n\\nVanguard's investment in Insmed Inc reflects its broader interest in the healthcare sector, which is one of its top investment areas. The biotechnology industry, where Insmed operates, is known for its high-risk, high-reward nature, and Vanguard's stake in the company indicates a calculated bet on the industry's future.\\n\\nComparative Positioning Among Major Investors\\n\\nWhile Vanguard Group Inc has increased its holdings in Insmed Inc, it is essential to compare its position with other major investors. The largest guru holding shares in Insmed is Leucadia National, although specific share percentage data is not provided. Vanguard's 10.07% stake in Insmed places it as a significant investor, potentially influencing the company's strategic direction and reflecting Vanguard's confidence in Insmed's prospects.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Vanguard Group Inc's recent trade in Insmed Inc shares is a strategic addition to its portfolio, aligning with its investment philosophy and sector focus. While the financial and growth metrics of Insmed present a mixed picture, Vanguard's move may be seen as a long-term play in the biotechnology space, which is known for its potential for significant returns.\\n\\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The market’s growth this year has been dominated by the mega-cap tech stocks.\\n\\nThe 2023 main players are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The concentrated gains in a few leading tech names is especially frustrating if an investor doesn’t own those particular stocks and missed this year’s bull run.\\n\\nHowever, other tech stocks offer a silver lining, ones that have performed well this year and still showing more upside ahead. Investors can still get in the game before their next leg higher.

Shares of AMD are up a healthy 83% in 2023. But that’s less than half the 240% run in NVDA stock.\\n\\nAlso, analysts see more upside ahead for AMD stock. The median price target on the shares is 11% higher than current levels. Analysts have been revising their targets in recent weeks after AMD issued strong third-quarter financial results.\\n\\nAMD reported Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of 70 cents compared to the 68 cents expected by Wall Street. Revenue totaled $5.8 billion versus the forecast of $5.7 billion, increasing 4% from a year earlier. However, the showstopper was AMD’s 2024 forecast of $2 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) microchip sales.\\n\\nAMD hopes to take AI market share away from Nvidia with its new MI300A and MI300X microchips that are expected to be among the most powerful available on the market.\\n\\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\\n\\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor a hot tech stock that’s still flying under the radar, look to the data analytics company, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR).\\n\\nShare prices jumped 20% higher after it announced Q3 earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year revenue guidance. Year to date (YTD), PLTR stock is up 207%. That outperforms Magnificent Seven stocks such as Apple and Microsoft, each of which is up only about 50% on the year.\\n\\nPalantir’s stock has been soaring high since it reported Q3 EPS of 7 cents compared to 6 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter came in at $558 million versus $556 million that was forecast. Revenue was up 17% in Q3 from a year earlier. Investors like Palantir’s growing commercial work, which now accounts for 33% of its revenue. This is lessening its reliance on U.S. government contracts.\\n\\nAlso, the company raised full-year revenue guidance of $2.21 billion to $2.22 billion, pleasing investors. PLTR stock has now increased 114% since its 2020 market debut.\\n\\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo.

The social media site that allows users to share recipes and videos saw its stock jump 18% after reported Q3 results beat Wall Street forecasts.\\n\\nPINS stock is now up 37% on the year. It’s a welcome reversal for the company that once flew high during the pandemic when people were trapped at home. Later, however, the stock got knocked lower throughout the 2022 bear market.\\n\\nPinterest’s Q3 EPS amounted to 28 cents compared to the 20 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue rose 11% from a year earlier to $763.2 million. That topped the $743.5 million that analysts expected. Importantly, PINS reports an increase in global monthly active users rising 8% to 482 million during Q3 from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 473 million monthly active users.

To skip our detailed analysis of how innovation is shaping the microeconomic outlook in 2023, go directly and see 10 Most Important Scientific Discoveries of All Time.\\n\\nIn its most pedantic definition, innovation can be described as the ability to conceive, develop, deliver and scale new products, services, processes and business models for consumers. Successful innovation delivers substantial net new growth and increases overall value. However, according to a survey by McKinsey, less than 10 percent of executives interviewed report being satisfied with the performance of their respective companies in innovation. They complain that their organizations are more established in operational capacity than in an innovative one, producing little to no creative game changers and getting by merely by optimizing existing core businesses. In our article 25 Most Innovative Companies in the World in 2023, we have established that some of the most innovative companies in the world today are Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). By investing in and maximizing innovative capabilities, these companies have achieved a substantial performance edge which differentiates them from their competitors in the market and in the process, have made some of the most important scientific discoveries of all time. Their success story is conclusive evidence that generating innovative capacity can lead to increased profitability, two and a half times higher than that of other competitors in the industry.\\n\\nInnovation - The Key In Tackling Disruption\\n\\n2023 so far has been characterized by significant macroeconomic disruption and uncertainty, as structural supply-chain issues, rising interest rates, and sustainability challenges imperil organizations around the world. In such a precarious climate, most companies tend to adopt a defensive mindset and wait for the situation to normalize. According to an article by McKinsey and Company, this is proving to be a high-risk strategy, as merely managing expenditure and trying to boost productivity is not likely to beat the growth challenge that more than 95% of companies struggle with today. The article asserts that companies need to follow in the footsteps of innovators like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and capitalize on emerging pockets of growth which can secure long-term prosperity. To outperform the current macroeconomic challenges, management teams within companies must refocus on developing innovative capabilities by identifying lucrative opportunities for growth and diversification, and developing new products, investing in creative business models focused on making some of the most important scientific discoveries of all time, and forging new partnerships.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBusiness models which are optimized to a specific set of global conditions have proven to me more susceptible to the current headwinds and need to divert greater focus on innovation as a way to open newer paths of viability. For instance, this has already panned out in the disruption of countless industries in light of shortages affecting consumer goods, retail and auto sectors, and the exacerbation of the global energy crisis. However, businesses which are resisting the headwinds by reshoring production or divesting into digital offerings are spearheading the economy out of disruption. This pattern has also played out during previous cycles; for example, during the economic turmoil of 2002, the company Best Buy Co. Ltd. (NYSE:BBY) realized that it could not afford to resist headwinds by relying on assortment breadth and competitive pricing alone. Hence, the company made larger investments in business model innovation, producing its flagship Geek Squad consumer support service which its competitors could not provide.\\n\\nRoadmap To Innovation: An Overview\\n\\nMcKinsey highlights numerous ways in which companies can deliver on and implement innovative solutions to resist economic headwinds, drive growth and make the most important scientific discoveries of all time. One of the main ways companies can do this is by selecting a balanced portfolio of short and long-term innovations. As consumer demands change, overdoing insubstantial product tweaks which may only address temporary needs are not likely to drive long-term performance. However, revisiting and innovating on designs and processes can produce savings which will help provide for long-term investments in innovations which may lead to significant growth.\\n\\nCompanies must also identify and tap into emerging adjacencies. Economic uncertainties like the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain turbulence, and geopolitical shocks have led to major companies like\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tap into adjacent markets. Transport companies discovered lucrative niches in delivering restaurant food and other necessities, while most electric vehicle manufacturers monetized battery production and invested in recycling. A survey by McKinsey in 2021 demonstrated that during the first 9 months of the pandemic, top economic performers innovated nearly twice as fast as their low-performing competitors in generating new products and services. Some of these markets may exist in many of the countries covered in our article on the 21 Most Innovative Countries in the World.\\n\\nLastly, companies need to adapt to the changing macroeconomic environment by evolving business models accordingly. Innovating business models can encourage organizations to drive an increasing number of core competencies into action, all the while driving adaptability and greater growth. Such innovations may affect value propositions, production models, routes to market, and the investment of assets and capabilities. This may come with a significant strategic upside as well.

However, with the global smartphone market on the mend, things are starting to look up for QCOM. Wall Street also remains hopeful of Qualcomm’s future, given management’s belief in stabilizing market dynamics. Also, AI-driven opportunities may improve Qualcomm’s fundamentals in the coming years, which is why I am bullish on QCOM stock.\\n\\nMacroeconomic Headwinds Strained Qualcomm’s Fiscal 2023\\n\\nQualcomm’s success has relied on its innovative chipsets, particularly the Snapdragon series. These chipsets power a vast range of devices, from smartphones, tablets, and wearables to automotive systems.\\n\\nHowever, Fiscal 2023 turned out to be not so positive for the chipmaker, led by a slowdown in smartphone sales. Rising inflation has put a damper on consumer spending on discretionary products such as electronics and smartphones. Its latest fourth-quarter Fiscal 2023 results were also gloomy, disappointing investors. The stock has gained a mere\\xa018.2% YTD, which is not great compared to the massive gains its peers in the semiconductor industry have achieved so far in 2023.\\n\\nIn Q4, its revenue declined\\xa0by 24% year-over-year\\xa0to $8.7 billion, beating consensus estimates by $146 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter fell by 35% to $2.02, surpassing\\xa0estimates by $0.11.\\xa0For the full Fiscal year, revenue and earnings declined by\\xa019% and 33%,\\xa0respectively.\\n\\nNotably, Qualcomm’s operations are distinguished by two segments: QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies), which represents its chip business, and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing), which covers its licensing business. In Fiscal 2023, QCT accounted for about\\xa085% of its total revenue.\\n\\nLet’s break down its revenue for the QCT segment (chip sales). The market’s lukewarm demand for new smartphones led to a\\xa022% decline\\xa0in Handset chip sales in Fiscal 2023, while its IoT (Internet of Things) chip sales dropped 19.2% year-over-year. Qualcomm’s Automotive chip sales, on the other hand, stood out with a 24% increase from Fiscal 2022.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs the automotive industry continues to evolve, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis remains an essential part of this digital transformation. In the\\xa0Q4 earnings call, CEO Cristiano Renno Amon highlighted the company’s new long-term strategic deal with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS (Amazon Web Services) “to enable automakers to integrate cloud technologies into their vehicle development life cycle.”\\n\\nWhat’s more, Qualcomm is also a dividend stock that has a\\xa0dividend yield of 2.6%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s (SPX) average yield of\\xa01.6%.\\xa0The company generated $9.8 billion in\\xa0free cash flow\\xa0in Fiscal 2023, out of which it used $3.5 billion to pay dividends and $3 billion to\\xa0repurchase shares.\\xa0It also ended Fiscal 2023 with a strong balance sheet\\xa0with $11.3 billion\\xa0in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\\n\\nFiscal 2024 Could Turn Around QCOM’s Fortunes\\n\\nGoing into 2024, according to\\xa0International Data Corporation, the global smartphone market is expected to recover by\\xa04.5% year-over-year. This recovery could help boost demand for Qualcomm’s products.\\n\\nWhile other chip makers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are ramping up their AI efforts, Qualcomm is raising the stakes in the game as well.\\n\\nIn its annual Snapdragon Summit event in October, the company unveiled two new generative AI-integrated chips, the\\xa0Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\\xa0for smartphones and the\\xa0Snapdragon X Elite\\xa0for the personal computer (PC) market. For improved audio experiences, it also unveiled the AI-powered\\xa0S7 and S7 Pro Gen 1\\xa0sound platforms.\\n\\nQualcomm’s efforts to stay current with the evolving tech industry by incorporating AI into all its products and services are positioning it for more growth. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, Qualcomm also announced a deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to supply\\xa0Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems\\xa0for smartphone launches from 2024-26.\\n\\nLooking ahead, management sees signs of stabilization in the demand for\\xa03G, 4G, and 5G handsets\\xa0worldwide. Hence, the company now forecasts Q1 Fiscal 2024 revenue in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.9 billion and EPS between $2.25 and $2.45.\\n\\nIf Qualcomm meets the upper end of the guidance, that would mean 5% revenue and 3.4% earnings growth over the\\xa0year-ago period.\\xa0Along with an amazing sequential growth of 14% in revenue and 21.3% in earnings, it would also signal the global smartphone market’s recovery. Meanwhile, analysts forecast revenue of $9.5 billion and EPS of $2.36 for Fiscal Q1 2024.\\n\\nAlthough Qualcomm did not provide full-year guidance for Fiscal 2024, the outlook for the start of the fiscal year appears encouraging. Analysts foresee its revenue and earnings to show year-over-year growth of\\xa05.5% and 9.3%, respectively. Currently, Qualcomm trades\\xa0at 13.4 times\\xa0its projected 2024 earnings. For a growth stock with AI capabilities, its valuation seems fair.\\n\\nIs Qualcomm a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nFollowing Qualcomm’s fourth-quarter results, TD Cowen analyst\\xa0Matt Ramsay reaffirmed his Buy rating on the stock with a target price of $145.00. The analyst finds Qualcomm’s successful foray into the PC space and its commanding presence in the Android handset market to be impressive. Additionally, DZ Bank also upgraded QCOM stock to Buy from Hold, assigning a price target of $140.\\n\\nMeanwhile, after QCOM’s Q4 earnings, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee now believes Qualcomm “finally reported an end to the downward spiral” with its rosy outlook for Q1 Fiscal 2024. The analyst has a Buy rating on the stock and raised its price target from $135 to $140.\\n\\nOut of the 21 analysts covering Qualcomm stock, 14 recommend a Buy, six recommend a Hold, and one recommends a Sell, giving the stock a Moderate Buy rating. The\\xa0average QCOM stock price target is $135.83, implying 7% upside potential over the next 12 months.\\n\\nThe Takeaway\\n\\nQualcomm still plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of technology as we delve deeper into the 5G, IoT, and AI era. Its relentless pursuit of innovation, coupled with its diverse product portfolio and improving market dynamics, may all contribute to stronger revenue and profit growth in the years to come. For this reason, I remain cautiously optimistic that good days are ahead for Qualcomm.\\n\\nDisclosure', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-stock-nasdaq-qcom-good-194643245.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AMD.US', 'AMZN.US', 'JPM.US', 'NVDA.US', 'QCI.F', 'QCI.XETRA', 'QCOM.MX', 'QCOM.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.113}}, {'date': '2023-11-14T19:10:00+00:00', 'title': 'Microsoft and Apple Can Make a Big Difference in the Movement of This ETF', 'content': 'The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF has made a new all-time high and that factoid has been repeated on the cable financial programs many times this Tuesday.

Washington is trying to prevent China from acquiring high-end computer chips and has imposed curbs on US investment there. Beijing has responded by jump-starting its own chip efforts and exhorting citizens to buy locally made phones and other products. From tech to logistics, oil and gas to finance, companies are struggling to maintain access to Chinese consumers even as they try to navigate a growing list of regulations, tariffs and export controls.\\n\\nSome of the biggest names in American business are scheduled to attend, among them Citigroup’s Jane Fraser, Exxon’s Darren Woods, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Tesla Inc. and SpaceX’s Elon Musk. A number of executives have been invited to dine with Xi, according to people familiar with the plans, a chance for them to air their concerns and ambitions in a less formal setting.\\n\\n“If Xi is going to meet these business leaders at this summit, they’ll be looking for signals that the US-China relationship is thawing,” said Dan Prud’homme, an assistant professor of business at Florida International University.\\n\\nFounded in 1989, APEC was created to promote free and fair trade as China began its historic economic opening under Deng Xiaoping. APEC meetings rarely lead to breakthroughs—or even agreement. Still, the San Francisco gathering marks the first time the US has hosted the event in 12 years and will provide a widely welcomed opportunity for President Joe Biden and Xi to meet face to face.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPotential Thaw\\n\\nIn recent months high-level officials from both countries have met multiple times to lay the groundwork for the first summit between the two men in a year. In one sign of a potential thaw, the Chinese government is considering unveiling a purchase agreement for Boeing Co.’s 737 Max jetliner during APEC, according to people familiar with the situation. Xi isn’t expected to announce a formal order for the plane, the people said. But a deal would be a significant breakthrough for Boeing, which has been largely frozen out of the Chinese market in recent years. In another development, China bought more than 3 million metric tons of soybeans from the US last week, a goodwill gesture, according to people familiar with the matter.\\n\\n“Both sides have decided right now to tap the brakes and try to inject a degree of stability into what is otherwise a deteriorating situation,” said Evan Medeiros, who was President Barack Obama’s top advisor on Asia and now is the Penner Family Chair in Asian Studies at Georgetown University.\\n\\nFor business leaders, APEC is an opportunity to schmooze, press their agendas and pontificate about the state of the world. Musk is scheduled to join Salesforce Inc. CEO Marc Benioff for a session called “Conversations on the Future.” Exxon CEO Woods plans to give a speech called “Reframing the Climate Challenge: Keep the Energy, Curb the Emissions.”\\n\\nThe hottest ticket is the Xi dinner, and executives were scrambling for seats or to be put on a waiting list, according to people familiar with the situation. The Chinese president is under pressure to assure executives that his nation is very much open for business and making progress in its efforts to revive the economy. His guests will be keen to tell him that they still see China as a vitally important market despite Washington’s efforts to erect barriers around sensitive technologies.\\n\\nRead more: China Foreign Investment Gauge Turns Negative For First Time\\n\\nSome companies are more directly affected than others by Beijing’s crackdown on foreign businesses, and few more so than Apple Inc., which generates about a fifth of its revenue from the region and manufactures the vast majority of its devices there. Apple’s sales in China slowed last quarter, and it’s facing rising competition from Huawei Technologies Co. Bloomberg and other media have reported that Beijing has limited the use of the iPhone and other foreign technology at agencies and state-backed firms. Government officials have denied that.\\n\\nWhile Tim Cook isn’t attending APEC — instead sending a middle-ranking government-affairs official — the Apple CEO visited Beijing last month. He met with Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who told him China welcomes Apple and other multinationals.\\n\\nSan Francisco is emerging as a central hub for artificial intelligence, and the technology will be much on the minds of attendees. Officials around the world have expressed concerns about AI’s potential dangers even as the US and China compete to dominate the dawning era of chatbots and content generators. Last month, in an executive order, Biden proposed regulating sales to foreign entities of cloud-computing power used to feed data to the software models that generate AI content.\\n\\nMicrosoft has baked generative AI into all of its major products, and Nadella is scheduled to talk up the technology in a speech on Wednesday. “Now is the moment for dialogue on the pivotal role of AI breakthroughs in shaping the global economy,” Microsoft Asia chief Ahmed Mazhari said in a statement. Google, which is sending several executives, plans to explain why its AI products are suitable for Asian markets.\\n\\nWhile many of the mutual trade restrictions have been targeted at companies whose products have national-security implications, Florida International University’s Prud’homme notes that many of the companies attending APEC don’t make products that can be used for military purposes. “They’re somewhat off the radar of the US government national security establishment,” he said. “And they will be wanting to convince their counterparts in China that they are in industries that should not be targeted by the current political tensions.”\\n\\nPetrochemical Plant\\n\\nExxon is a case in point. Having won permission to build a multibillion dollar petrochemical plant in Guangdong Province, the company wants to be a key supplier of plastics to the country’s manufacturing industry for decades to come.\\n\\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s social-media apps Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have been blocked in parts of Asia for years, notably China. But the company is becoming increasingly reliant on the region to manufacture its virtual reality headsets and smart glasses. During APEC, Meta executives will be looking to strengthen ties with government officials and Asia-based manufacturers that can enable or hamper its growth.\\n\\nTo be sure, US corporations run risks forging close ties with China. The country has drawn international opprobrium for its treatment of the minority Uyghurs, restricting citizens’ freedoms and increased military aggression toward Taiwan.\\n\\nApple is regularly criticized for the concessions it has made to operate in China. The company partnered with a government-linked enterprise to power iCloud, raising concerns that Beijing could access data stored on users’ Apple accounts — an assertion Apple has contested. It has eliminated apps on the local version of its App Store if Bejing objects to them and agreed not to operate such digital services as Apple TV+, the iTunes Store and Apple Arcade.\\n\\nMusk, whose Tesla has a factory in Shanghai, has also been criticized for cozying up to Beijing. He caused an international uproar last year when he suggested the world treat Taiwan as a special administrative region like Hong Kong.\\n\\nMost executives refrain from openly criticizing Beijing, but FedEx Corp. chairman and founder Fred Smith recently told an energy conference that China had “become mercantilist, protectionist and [has] a geopolitical ambition to become a hegemon.”\\n\\nSmith isn’t attending APEC. But his successor as CEO, Raj Subramaniam, will be there and is expected to echo his mentor’s longstanding argument that more trade drives economic growth, creates wealth and spreads peace.\\n\\n--With assistance from Jenny Leonard, Isis Almeida, Jennifer Jacobs, Shawn Donnan, Kevin Crowley, Brody Ford, Paige Smith, Mark Gurman, Aisha Counts, Dana Hull and Julie Johnsson.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nEverything Biden and Xi Need From Their Summit—Starting With Each Other US Veterans Got a Mortgage Break.

To skip our overview of the blue chip sector and the latest news about the stock market, take a look at the 5 Cheap Blue Chip Stocks To Buy.\\n\\nWithin the American stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the most prestigious stock indexes. It has been around in one form or the other for more than a hundred years, and over the course of this long history, the index is periodically re balanced. The stock index is constituted of firms that the S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) believes are an adequate representation of the U.S. economy. Naturally given the central role that information technology plays in today's world, the biggest companies part of the DJIA are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\n\\nInformally, the DJIA is also referred to as a blue chip stock index - a term that is borrowed from poker chips. These chips are the most valuable in the stock market according to the DJIA's creators, and along with the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500, the index is one of the most closely watched stock indexes in America. In terms of returns, the blue chip segment often lags behind the high growth NASDAQ 100 and NASDAQ Composite since they are comprised of a large number of high growth technology firms. However, on the flip side, the DJIA also offers stability to investors as its constituents are a stable set of companies with sizeable balance sheets and stable markets that serve them well during turbulent economic times. If you're interested to learn more about the history of the DJIA blue chip stock index, you should check out 12 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According to Wall Street Analysts.\\n\\nThe DJIA, like the broader stock market, has been rattled by global geopolitical conflicts as well as the rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curtail inflation. 2022, which was quite a rattling time to be investing in the stock market saw the DJIA tank from its 2021 close of 36,338 to a bottom of 28,725 in September at what was the peak of the Federal Reserve's rate hike frenzy. It closed the year at 33,147, to mark an 8.7% drop which was still digestible compared to the 21% drop at the September trough.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFast forward to 2023 and the index represents a different picture. The first half of this year was spectacular for the stock market as big tech roared to life and soared to new highs due to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence. Between January and June 2023, the DJIA soared by 1,260 points or 3%. The second half has been rather flat in terms of returns, with the DJIA having lost 194 points so far and pared back some of the losses in November.\\n\\nWhy November? Well, November might be the first month where the Federal Reserve's future interest rate strategy might be starting to become clearer. Throughout this year, investors have flirted with the idea of rates coming down sooner, and in November, Fed chairman Jerome Powell's statements that the central bank was cognizant of soaring bond yields in its interest rate decision making provided relief to investors. Higher bond yields make borrowing capital more expensive, and there are some worries that when combined with a high policy rate, they can damage the economy far more than is needed to curtail inflation. The Fed chair's comments, combined with a favorable employment report led to the DJIA and other major stock indexes to mark their strongest week in 2023 for the week that ended on November 3, 2023.\\n\\nSo, as the investment climate in the stock market appears to be cautiously improving, we decided to take a look at some cheap blue chip stocks to buy with the notable picks being Verizon Communications Inc.

To skip our introduction, you can go directly to 5 Stocks from Companies Generating High Cash Flow.\\n\\nWhat is cash flow statement?\\n\\nCash flow is the inflow or outflow of cash and cash equivalents that a business generates or spends in a certain period of time. Cash flows differ from profits in most cases, which necessitates the preparation of a separate cash flow statement to assess the cash flows of the company. Profit is the money left behind after taking out all the expenses while cash flow refers to the flow of cash and equivalents. The difference between the two mainly arises from the presence of non-cash expenses, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, and other similar transactions.\\n\\nCash flows of a company can be assessed from the periodic cash flow statements prepared by the company. The statement typically has three parts: cash from operating activities, cash from investing activities, and cash from financing activities. To summarize, the three parts show how much cash has been generated or spent through the operations of the company, through investing activities, and the net flows of cash that are used to fund the company, respectively.\\n\\nWhy is there a need for a cash flow statement?\\n\\nDue to the differences in the cash flows and profit figures, the income statement or the profit and loss statement typically isn’t enough to assess the financial position of a company. Even though profits have their importance, there are many who associate the success of a company on the basis of the ability of the company to manage their cash flows effectively. The epitaph, “cash is king” can be read on the tombstones of many failed businesses that went under as they didn’t have enough cash to stay afloat.\\n\\nThe importance of cash grows with the costs of financing available to companies. These days, with the recent increases in the monetary policy rates across several large economies including the United States, availability of cash and equivalents is paramount for the successful operations of any company. On the other hand, companies can carry on with their functions with low cash balances as additional financing is readily available at attractive rates. A prime example of a company going under due to the mismatch of their inflows and outflows is the Silicon Valley Bank which went under earlier this year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor the sake of this article, we have used free cash flows generated in the trailing twelve months to assess the attractiveness of a company as an investment. The free cash flow figure for a company depicts the amount of cash and equivalents left with the company after cash outflows required for operations and to maintain capital assets. This shows the amount left over to repay creditors and to return profits of the company to its shareholders.\\n\\nOur list of stocks from companies generating high cash flow includes tech giants such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as companies from other industries, such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), among others.

You can skip our detailed discussion and jump directly to the 5 Largest Hedge Funds in the World and Their Top Stock Picks.\\n\\nThe hedge fund industry has expanded rapidly over the last three years due to market volatility. In 2023, the industry is expected to reach a record $5 trillion in assets under management. The strong capital inflows suggest that investors view hedge funds as an appealing alternative investment option in volatile markets. According to Goldman Sachs, hedge funds will outperform 60/40 portfolios in 2023 after returning 11.8% in 2020, 13% in 2021, and significantly outperforming 60/40 portfolios in 2022. Data from the past also suggests that hedge funds perform well in volatile markets and high-interest-rate environments. Long-short equity strategies have generated an 8% return year to date, while multi, relative value, and credit strategies have also performed well so far in 2023. According to PivotalPath data, every hedge fund strategy it monitors has been profitable so far this year, and 75% of the funds it tracks remain profitable, with an average return of 9.1%.\\n\\n“Total equity positions and total equity assets under management have increased in the third quarter at a pace we haven’t seen since 2015, suggesting a healthy appetite for stocks in the financials, energy, and healthcare sectors,” said Pavle Sabic, Head of Market Development, S&P Global Market Intelligence.\\n\\nLower volatility in the last decade has reduced trading opportunities for hedge funds. However, market fundamentals have shifted dramatically in the last three years, with uncertainty and volatility at one of the highest levels due to a variety of factors, including tail event risks. Currently, investors are unsure whether the global economy is entering a recession, whether there is a risk of financial contagion, how geopolitical instability will affect businesses, and how long the Fed will continue to tighten policies.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHigher volatility and uncertainty are likely to drive investors to alternative strategies such as hedge funds. Hedge funds are investment partnerships in which capital is pooled to invest in multiple assets to maximize returns and minimize risk. Hedge funds have a long history, dating back to 1949 when the first hedge fund was launched by A.W. Jones & Company.\\n\\nCurrently, there are thousands of hedge funds operating across the world. Some of the largest hedge funds in the world include AQR Capital Management, Renaissance Technologies, Man Group plc, Bridgewater Associates, and Berkshire Hathaway. The top stocks in hedge fund portfolios, according to data tracked by Insider Monkey, include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\\n\\nMethodology:\\n\\nTo identify the largest hedge funds in the world and their top stock picks, we conducted a thorough analysis of the hedge fund industry. The hedge funds listed below are ranked based on their AUM as of June 30, 2023. Insider Monkey tracks over 910 hedge funds and offers their US equity portfolios.

To skip the detailed analysis of the technology sector, go directly to the 5 Tech Stocks with low PE ratios.\\n\\nTechnology stocks faced a heavy beat down in 2022 and were one of the worst-performing sectors of the year. Two of the US Big Five tech companies, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost over $1.2 trillion in market cap. Similarly, the tech-heavy NASDAQ was down 33.1% by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe tech sector made a significant comeback in 2023, primarily due to the generative artificial intelligence (AI) trend that has been making waves since the beginning of 2023. As of November 9, the NASDAQ composite is up 30.18% year-to-date (YTD) compared to the S&P 500’s 13.68% gain. Additionally, all of the S&P 500’s gains have been on the back of the top 7 technology stocks including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Between December 30, 2022, and October 31, 2023, these 7 stocks averaged collective gains of 50.65% while the rest of the S&P 493 declined by 2.05%.\\n\\nLong-Term Global Tech Market Forecast\\n\\nA DataTrek report predicts the average earnings estimate for the big seven tech stocks to be 0.7% for 2024 compared to -0.5% for the S&P 500. Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote:\\n\\n“US big tech is in better fundamental shape than the broader U.S. equity market right now, which should enable these stocks to outperform and help drive the S&P higher into year-end, as long as rates remain stable or lower.”\\n\\nWe previously reported that global tech spending is expected to increase 4.7% year-over-year (YoY) in 2023 to $4.4 trillion. Between 2024 and 2027, the Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific are expected to have the highest spending growth in the sector at 5.6% and 5.4%, respectively. North American tech spending is expected to increase by 5.1%, and Europe’s spending is expected to increase by 3.6% during the same period. Furthermore, blockchain technology is expected to experience the highest CAGR between 2023 and 2030, at nearly 138%. AI is expected to be the biggest industry in the tech sector, reaching a market size of $2.57 trillion by 2032, followed by autonomous systems with a market size of $2.35 trillion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDespite such a bullish forecast for AI, UBS warned that AI stocks might see some correction due to investors moving toward other parts of the broader tech industry:\\n\\n“For technology investors overall, we continue to see opportunities in tech laggards and mid-cycle industries like software and internet, as investors continue to reposition portfolios away from early cyclicals like semiconductors. We would not be surprised to see a 10–15% reset lower in AI-related stocks in the near term, given regulatory headwinds, supply bottlenecks, and elevated valuations. Investors with significant concentration in US technology should also consider opportunities in Europe and emerging market tech stocks. Many companies outside the US enjoy similar, if not better, medium- to longer-term growth profiles. And some trade at attractive valuations, in our view. We therefore think growth-based investors with a significant concentration in US tech stocks should rebalance their portfolios by diversifying into global tech stocks with solid business models.”\\n\\nMost of the analysts and financial news media see the technology sector in a favorable light. Keeping that in mind, some of the tech stocks with a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio include Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK), United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC), and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. (NYSE:PAGS).\\n\\nWill Technology Replace Human Labor?\\n\\nThere is a huge fear among the masses that technology, especially AI, will replace human labor, and many people will be out of jobs because of it. Nevertheless, these claims seem highly exaggerated, as discussed in our article, 16 Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI. In 1900, 41% of the US workforce was employed in the agriculture sector, and it was down to 2% exactly a century later due to technological advancements in agricultural machinery. Despite such a decline in the agricultural workforce, new jobs were created with the rise of technological advancements. Similarly, AI will certainly take over a lot of jobs that require human labor, but it will also create several new jobs, and there are some that AI just won’t be able to replace for the foreseeable future. 12 Tech Stocks with low PE ratio\\n\\nAn engineer examining a complex circuit board, a cornerstone of the organization\\'s spintronics and nanotechnology technologies.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nFor this article, we compiled a list of all the mid to mega-cap technology stocks trading on the NYSE and NASDAQ with a PE ratio below 15 through the Yahoo Finance stock screener.

Here is what it said:\\n\\n“Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is one of the top two customer experience (CX) vendors globally. The company started off running call centers but has evolved into a high-tech business process outsourcer (BPO) that also designs and runs customer-facing websites and apps, integrates all the data and optimizes a client’s customer interactions. CX itself is a relatively new business and Concentrix has been rolling up smaller competitors – in March, 2023 they bought WebHelp, a leading European CX player for cash and stock.\\n\\nWe believe this should help consolidate an industry where Concentrix and Teleperformance are the largest players. Concentrix was spun out of TD Synnex, another of the Fund’s core holdings, and we have always been impressed with the company’s innovation and growth. The market is currently worried about the ability for artificial intelligence to disrupt Concentrix’ core call center business and the shares of all of the large CX companies have underperformed materially.”\\n\\n10.

(NYSE:RTX) selling $6 billion in investment-grade bonds over various durations to help repay a short-term loan it got to cover its $10 billion accelerated share repurchase.\\n\\nIs it just me, or does that seem ridiculous in a higher interest-rate market?\\n\\n“Both Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings reduced the outlook on RTX’s rating to negative from stable due to its debt load following the share-buyback announcement,” stated Bloomberg.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nTypically, I’d discuss three stocks other than RTX in this situation. However, the sheer insanity of the move makes me want to examine the defense contractor’s long-term track record for buying back its stock.\\n\\nAs a result, here are two stocks and RTX using debt-fueled buybacks, seemingly undeterred by rising interest rates.\\n\\nRTX Corp. (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLet’s dig deep into RTX’s borrowing.\\n\\nFirst, the smallest of the five debt tranches was $500 millon at 5.75% maturing in 2029. The largest was $1.75 billion at 6.4% maturing in 2054. Also, it is the most extended duration. A back-of-the-napkin calculation suggests it will pay $365 million in annual interest on these bonds. True, that’s better than the current prime rate (8.5%), which it paid for its bridge loan.\\n\\nNext, look at the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR).\\n\\nIn exchange for $10 billion, RTX received 108.45 million shares, an average price of $92.21. That’s about $10 higher than the current share price, although more shares could be delivered as part of the ASR.\\n\\nRaytheon Technologies merged with United Technologies on Apr. 3, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, it had 1.53 billion shares outstanding. The company changed its name to RTX in July. As of the end of the third quarter (Sept. 30), it had 1.44 billion shares outstanding. Based on the 108.45 million shares repurchased through its ASR, it reduced its share count by 7.5% to $1.33 billion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor the first nine months of 2023, it repurchased $2.59 billion of its stock at an average price of $88.0 a share. Then in 2022, it repurchased $2.8 billion of its stock at an average price of $93.61. Finally, in 2021, it repurchased $2.33 billion at $83.10 a share. And, it bought back $47 million in 2020 (merger year) for $142.42 a share.\\n\\nTo summarize, it has repurchased $15.44 billion of its stock, including its ASR, for an average price of $92.59 a share. That’s a return on investment of -11%.\\n\\nAnd for this wonderful return, RTX gets an 18% increase in its long-term debt. Absolute lunacy.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\\n\\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\\n\\nOnce upon a time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had zero debt. The iPhone manufacturer finished fiscal 2012 (September year-end) with zero long-term debt and $146.8 billion in cash, short-term, and long-term marketable securities.\\n\\nThen, in April 2013, the company announced that it would borrow $17 billion to buy back its shares. It plans to buy back up to $60 billion by 2015, up from a previous $10 billion share repurchase program.\\n\\nIn fiscal 2013, it repurchased $23 billion (19.4 million shares) of its stock. And, thanks to two stock splits in June 2014 (7-for-1) and August 2020 (4 for-1), the 19.4 million shares are now 543.2 million, worth $101.3 billion, a compound annual growth rate of 16.0%, much higher than its cost of capital on the $17 billion in loans.\\n\\nFinally, a decade later, Apple’s net cash position of $146.8 billion in 2012 is now $38.2 billion, 74% lower than in 2012.\\n\\nThe company issued $5.25 billion in bonds in May at interest rates between 4.0% and 4.85% to keep the share repurchases and dividends moving higher. The highest rate is for $1.25 billion in notes maturing in 2053. The annual interest on those bonds is $229 million, or 0.2% of its 2023 operating income of $114.3 billion.\\n\\nThere’s responsible use of debt (AAPL) and irresponsible (RTX).\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) Bristol-Myers Squib (BMY) logo displayed on a phone screen\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) issued $4.5 billion of senior unsecured debt on Oct. 30 in four tranches, with interest rates ranging from 5.75% to 6.4%. The latter matures in 2063, 40 years from now.\\n\\nLet’s look at a comparison. Apple specified the proceeds from its bond offering would be used for share repurchases and dividends. Yet, Bristol-Myers said in its prospectus that it would use them for “general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the financing of the proposed acquisition of Mirati and the fees and expenses in connection therewith and with this offering.”\\n\\nThe notes offering increased its long-term debt by 14% to $36.6 billion. Its long-term debt accounts for 55.7% of its total capital. That’s not an overly leveraged capital structure. Apple’s debt-to-capital ratio is approximately 60.9%.\\n\\nThe drug company has ramped up its share repurchases in the past three years, buying back $14.3 billion in 2021 and 2022. It bought $5.2 billion through the first nine months of 2023. That’s an average price of $68.66 a share for the 284 million repurchased over the past 33 months.\\n\\nFinally, thanks to a 30% decline in its share price in 2023, Bristol-Myers’ ROI on its share repurchases since the beginning of 2022 is -26.3%. Considering its shares have spent little time over $70 in the past five years, the buybacks have not added value for shareholders.\\n\\nIf you own BMY shares, I’d be very disappointed if it doesn’t make large buys in the final quarter of 2023.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Get all this news and more in real-time with InvestingPro.\\n\\n1) Apple is now seen as the major AI beneficiary\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analysts released a note this week. They argue that 2024 will be a catalyst year for ‘Edge AI’ – a dominant market theme that will benefit certain companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\\n\\n“We see Edge AI as a multi-year tailwind that can improve Product and Services monetization and drive Apple\\'s user base LTV higher, a key driver of long-term valuation, supporting our Overweight rating,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe analysts argue that Apple will emerge as an Edge AI enabler because of 3 “distinct advantages” – Data, Privacy, and Vertical Integration.\\n\\nElsewhere, the other 5 stocks that are mentioned as AI ‘enablers’ are Dell (NASDAQ: NYSE:DELL), MediaTek Inc (OTC:MDTKF) Qualcomm (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:QCOM), Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), and STMicroelectronics NV ADR (NYSE:STM).\\n\\n2) Adobe is a new Top AI Pick at Piper Sandler\\n\\nPiper Sandler analysts named Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) the broker’s highest conviction idea to own into year-end, alongside Microsoft (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MSFT).\\n\\n\"October data reinforces our bullish view that new generative AI functions integrated directly into the application layer could better position ADBE to sustain growth despite a challenging macro,\" Piper Sandler analysts commented.\\n\\n\"Creative Cloud mobile downloads increased 19% y/y during the month of October (vs. 6% last year) while Acrobat mobile downloads increased 18% y/y (vs. 7% last year).\"\\n\\nPiper has an Overweight rating and a $650 per share price target on ADBE stock.\\n\\n“We suggest growth investors revisit ADBE and see the potential for another run into year-end on further proof points that AI could help sustain a recovery. MSFT and now ADBE are our highest conviction ideas to own into year-end.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n3) Microsoft’s ‘iPhone Moment’ Thesis Confirmed\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI’s first developer conference marked a significant stride toward becoming a platform company. Oppenheimer analysts attended the event and highlighted the announcement for a 75% price reduction, dropping the cost of GPT-4 LLM to $0.03 from $0.12 per 1K completion tokens.\\n\\nThis positions OpenAI\\'s model as a foundational building block or \"operating system\" for AI development, akin to Windows, iOS, and Android in their respective domains.\\n\\n“OpenAI further extended its \"app store\" beyond the popular plug-ins to userbuilt custom ChatGPTs, which can be resold in a \"GPT Store,\" creating a hard-to catch virtuous network effect,” analysts wrote.\\n\\n“For Microsoft, which has its own GAI platform strategy, OpenAI\\'s success is mutually synergistic.”\\n\\n4) Morgan Stanley increases its exposure to Dell\\n\\nMorgan Stanley investment strategists increased the bank’s exposure to Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)after adding a position in the stock. The bank’s 2 equity models now include Dell shares, which are up 80% this year.\\n\\n\"DELL appears well positioned to benefit from both the cyclical rebound in hardware markets and the long-term growth of artificial intelligence (“AI”)-related infrastructure,\" the investment bank wrote in a note.\\n\\nDELL is also seen as an AI beneficiary through its AI-optimized PowerEdge XE server.\\n\\n“The stock offers accelerating capital return with 10%+ potential annual dividend growth for the next five years,\" strategists concluded.\\n\\n5) NVIDIA is still an undisputed AI chip leader - Bernstein\\n\\nBernstein analysts discussed reports emerging from South Korea where Naver, the local version of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), identified a solution to replace NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Sapphire Rapids (NASDAQ: INTC) and AI accelerators.\\n\\n“We still believe Switching GPU to CPU is not an ideal option because it is super costly for AI tasks, especially LLM model training,” analysts wrote.\\n\\n“We think the collaboration between Naver and Intel is doable for very narrow use cases, or inference function only, or low enough parameters; but definitely not the game changer yet.”\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n5 big analyst AI moves: Piper’s high conviction in Adobe, Edge AI a plus for Apple\\n\\nEdward Jones upgrades Oracle to buy on cloud expansion potential\\n\\nBlackRock pushes for standardized SEC rules on crypto ETFs', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-analyst-ai-moves-102548829.html', 'symbols': ['12DA.F', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ADB.F', 'ADBE.US', 'ADBE34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'DELL.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'INTC.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.987, 'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.089}}, {'date': '2023-11-13T02:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Apple’s China Woes Stoke $20 Billion Xiaomi Rally', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s sales dip in China is providing an opportunity for yet another local Android smartphone maker to win favor with customers and investors.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nBiden Has Wiped Away $127 Billion in Student Loan Debt An Opioid-Like Drink Is Masquerading As a Wholesome Alcohol Alternative Xi Jinping’s ‘Old Friends’ from Iowa Get a Dinner Invitation Trump’s 40 Wall St. Loan Transferred to Special Servicer Iceland Braces for Volcanic Eruption That Could Wipe Out Town\\n\\nXiaomi Corp. has gained about $20 billion in market value since a June low on excitement over its latest handset as well as as forays into electric vehicles and other businesses. The Hong Kong-listed stock rose more than 60% in that span, making it the best performer on the Hang Seng Tech Index.\\n\\nChinese Android makers are capitalizing as Apple posts sliding revenue in the country, even amid signs that Asia’s largest smartphone market is starting to bottom out after years of decline.\\n\\nXiaomi’s 14 series has received over one million orders since its late-October launch. That marks the second smash debut for a Chinese smartphone in just the past few months, following Huawei Technologies Co.’s success with the Mate 60 Pro. Huawei is unlisted, but investors have been snapping up shares of its suppliers.\\n\\nHuawei Drives $34 Billion China Stock Boom in Rare Hot Trades\\n\\nWhile Xiaomi’s stock has surged on the stellar 14 series orders, some analysts say it’s poised to climb even higher. EVs and and the so-called “artificial intelligence of things” are seen as potential additional catalysts.\\n\\n“We believe there is a trading opportunity in the next six months with smartphone and AIoT growth turnarounds and early expectations building for Xiaomi’s electric vehicle foray,” Gokul Hariharan, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note last week, upgrading the stock to overweight.\\n\\nOther Wall Street firms including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. have cited signs of an end to China’s smartphone downturn and a likely recovery into next year. Huawei’s surprisingly strong comeback has helped triggered Chinese consumer appetite for innovative local products.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“Huawei is clearly gaining ground rapidly following the new product launch featuring its unique camera function and satellite calling,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management. ”iPhone sales are losing momentum in China at the moment, as many consumers don’t perceive much functionality improvement in the new iPhone.”\\n\\nUBS Strategists Prefer China Internet Stocks Over US Big Tech\\n\\nXiaomi’s 14 series also sports an advanced camera, as well as the latest Qualcomm Inc. processor and an innovative operating system called HyperOS designed to connect the smartphone to autos, appliances and other AIoT devices.\\n\\nWhile Huawei is likely to gain the most share among Chinese brands in the current smartphone cycle, Xiaomi’s technology should help it fend off rivals including Oppo and Vivo into next year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Tseng. “In addition, the potential growth opportunity in overseas markets will be in favor of Xiaomi, which has the best overseas presence among all Chinese phone vendors,” he said.\\n\\nThe rally in Xiaomi’s shares since the 14 series’ release has pushed them into overbought territory, technicals suggest. But market watchers say the shares could ride further on upcoming catalysts including Singles’ Day and results for the third quarter due November 20.\\n\\n“Xiaomi is the only top five smartphone brand to see shipment increases both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year in 3Q 2023 as it strengthened its positions in key markets such as China and India,” Counterpoint Research wrote in a note.\\n\\nThe company notched “historical high” gross merchandise value for Singles’ Day, helped by strong performance for the 14 series, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Timothy Moe wrote in a note.\\n\\nThere are other ways to trade the idea too, as — like with Apple and Huawei — Xiaomi has its own ecosystem of suppliers. Among key component makers for Xiaomi, mainland-listed Will Semiconductor Co. and OFILM Group Co. have both climbed in the past month.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nChina’s Alibaba Group Holding and JD.com reported sales increases for Singles’ Day, after the e-commerce giants offered steep discounts to attract consumers to the country’s shopping extravaganza. Meta Platforms Inc. is close to reaching a deal that will bring its mixed reality headset to China through a partnership with Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Outfitted with the company’s new M3 chip, the latest iMac is a solid go-to computer for people looking for a family system that can handle daily web browsing, productivity apps, and some gaming in a compact package.\\n\\nStarting at $1,299, the iMac stands out among most other all-in-one computers thanks to its high-resolution 4.5K display and funky array of colors, a hallmark of the lineup. For the average person, the base iMac is likely more than enough to get by.\\n\\nBut if you’re looking for a bit more graphics oomph, you’ll need to opt for the $1,499 model, which features 2 additional GPU cores versus the standard iMac.\\n\\nI’ve been using the latest iMac for roughly a week, and its vast display performance proved more than enough for my daily workload. It even handled the game “Lies of P” without issue, helping to scratch that overwhelming gaming itch after a long day’s work. Apple's new iMac is a great daily driver for your computing needs. (Apple) (Apple)\\n\\nColorful, sleek, cool\\n\\nThe iMac’s biggest selling point is its slim design. Running a laptop chip means it doesn’t have to have a massive fan or large air vents to keep it cool, allowing Apple to make the desktop exceedingly thin. I popped my review version of the iMac on my desk, and it took up as much space as my normal PC monitor.\\n\\nBut the iMac’s other selling point is its colorful look. The latest iMac comes in seven different colors: blue, green, pink, purple, yellow, orange, and silver. I got the blue model and, well, loved it.\\n\\nMy work desk, which is actually more of a mix of a desk, kitchen table, dining room table, and coat rack—I live in Queens, lay off—is a bit too crowded to serve as a showcase for a statement piece like the iMac, but I imagine it’d look nice and neat in someone’s home office.\\n\\nThe iMac I reviewed came with an upgraded Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and numeric keypad, an $80 add-on if you buy the base iMac.\\n\\nAs you can probably imagine the keyboard came in the same color blue as the iMac itself.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAround back, the iMac features 2 USB C Thunderbolt ports, 2 USB C ports, and a power port.\\n\\nWhile a thin profile and fun colors are certainly a plus, you’re buying the iMac because of its 24-inch 4.5K resolution display. As you’d expect, images and videos looked exceptionally crisp on the panel. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\\n\\nIt’s a night and day difference going from my 4-year-old desktop monitor to the iMac. Colors look vibrant, and there’s plenty of space to open multiple apps and windows without having to rearrange them into tiny squares around the screen.\\n\\nA solid daily driver\\n\\nThe iMac’s new M3 chip gives it plenty of performance for your everyday needs and then some. I never experienced slowdown even while I was browsing the web, streaming music, livestreaming the experts on YahooFinance.com, and downloading games.\\n\\nThe game “Lies of P” ran smoothly and without issue with the graphics settings auto-selected. When I turned them all the way up, though, the game was a bit sluggish.\\n\\nThe game “Baldur’s Gate 3” ran well, but don’t expect to be able to play it on the highest graphics settings. It defaults to medium, which looks fine for sure. But if you want to get the best graphics experience, you’ll need more power than the iMac has to offer. This isn’t a gaming rig; it’s a system meant for everyday use rather than a monster designed to tackle graphics-intensive tasks.\\n\\nIf you’re in need of some serious processing power, the kind you’d need for high-end gaming, heavy-duty video editing, or working with CAD files, you’ll need to go with a pricier Mac Studio, which starts at $1,999.\\n\\nA go-to gets better\\n\\nOverall, the 24-inch iMac is an excellent all-in-one computer for most consumers. If you’re an Apple fan hunting for a no-nonsense desktop, the iMac is a no-brainer.\\n\\nFor those looking for serious processing firepower, though, you’ll want to take a step up to one of Apple’s more professional focused systems.\\n\\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

It gave Elon Musk his first big profit. Co-founder Peter Thiel became one of Silicon Valley’s leading political players. But that’s all ancient history. What PYPL stock has been doing lately is disappointing investors. Shares are down 22% in 2023. If you put $1,000 into Paypal 5 years ago, you’d have $650 now.\\n\\nIt’s up to Alex Chriss, hired away from Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) as CEO in August, to change the story on PYPL stock. Chriss’ accomplishment at Intuit was buying Mailchimp, an e-mail marketing firm, for $12 billion, but that will not be his first move here.\\n\\nShrink to Win\\n\\nDuring his first earnings call as CEO, on Nov. 1, Chriss mainly promised efficiency. “Our cost base remains too high and it’s actually slowing us down,” he said. Expect layoffs by Christmas, which Wall Street is bound to love.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nChriss also wants to get PayPal away from being a pure transaction company. That’s what it became under former CEO Dan Schulman. While that delivered consistent growth, Chriss sees players like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) grabbing share in the future. He also knows that Elon Musk’s original name for PayPal was X. The aim of X now to become what PayPal then promised to be, an “everything app” built around money.\\n\\nThe first step remains, however, cutting costs to improve margins. Chriss is buying back shares with extra cash flow, building a war chest. Paypal stock now sells for less than 17 times earnings and barely twice its yearly revenue. Chriss estimated full-year earnings for 2023 at $3.75 per share on his conference call, a raise from previous estimates of $3.49.\\n\\nThat should start the ball rolling.\\n\\nThe AI Growth Strategy\\n\\nChriss’ aim is to make PayPal a “platform company,” one that “can create meaningful profiles with the help of AI.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat starts with using generative AI to enhance automated threat detection and response. Getting checkout systems to spot possible fraud as it happens is the goal. PayPal says the company has already cut its own loss rate in half with such systems, while doubling volumes.\\n\\nThat can also mean using AI to recommend upsells. The company conducted over 300 experiments using AI just in the first half of the year.\\n\\nBut there are risks to expanding outward. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) wants apps like PayPal to follow the same regulations as banks. The CFPB has already warned customers of PayPal’s Venmo not to store money in their accounts, because it can be lost. PayPal has also been hit with a lawsuit over its transaction fees. Its seven-year old agreements with Visa (NYSE:V) are also drawing scrutiny.\\n\\nNo matter which direction PayPal looks to for growth, it’s clearly going to face competition, not just from other fintech companies but from governments.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on PYPL Stock\\n\\nCurrently PayPal is being valued like a payment processor, and not a very good one. Fiserv (NYSE:FI), a traditional processor, is valued at almost three times revenue.\\n\\nChriss wants to see PayPal valued like a tech stock. If it were, the company’s value could easily double.\\n\\nBut getting there takes more than just saying “AI” or other Internet buzzwords that make you swoon. It means delivering results like those tech companies deliver. The market is not convinced PayPal can do that yet.\\n\\nBut for Chriss, these are early days. I’ve often said I bet the jockey and not the horse, the CEO and his vision matter to me. If Chriss can turn his current plate of buzzwords into results, I’m all ears.\\n\\nI just want to see more.\\n\\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AAPL.

Currently, Berkshire Hathaway’s market capitalization stands at $754.32 billion.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway has had an impressive run over the last two decades. The stock has averaged a CAGR of 10%, slightly above the S&P 500’s 9.75% during the same period. However, these numbers may be skewed and slightly less than 10%. This may be a tell tale sign, as even Warren Buffett has struggled to beat the market over the last two decades.\\n\\nOn Monday, Nov. 5, Berkshire Hathaway reported its third quarter 2023 financial results. The company booked its first operating loss for the year of $12.77 billion, with operating earnings climbing 40% to $10.76 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on a record cash pile of $157.2 billion, as Warren Buffett seeks attractive returns in short-dated U.S. treasuries. If you’re looking for increased portfolio protection, Berkshire Hathaway is among the best recession-resistant stocks to consider.\\n\\nSPDR Gold Shares (GLD) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\\n\\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) is an ETF that seeks to track the spot price of physical gold bullion. It is the largest ETF to invest directly into physical gold. The ETF is managed by State Street Global Advisors, the world’s 4th largest asset manager with approximately $3.6 trillion in AUM.\\n\\nSPDR Gold Shares is unique in that it offers a relatively cost effective way to gain exposure to physical gold bullion. It is a much safer way to gain access to the gold market, rather than investing into gold mining stocks. Investors can sleep better at night knowing that they are less exposed to the cyclicality of the gold mining sector.\\n\\nSome of the largest hedge funds and institutions in the world hold SPDR Gold Shares including Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. There are a number of different ways to hedge your portfolio, and smart money tends to believe that a hard asset class like Gold should not be ignored. In 2023, the price of Gold rose more than 15% YTD as a result of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds threatening economic stability. If you want exposure to a hard asset, consider GLD as one of your best bets.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Can They Succeed?', 'content': 'Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are semiconductor kingpins that have a lot to gain from the generative artificial intelligence (AI) race. AI isn’t the only significant growth driver, though, as both firms look to make a big splash into the CPU (central processing unit) chip waters, using none other than Arm’s (NASDAQ:ARM) technology. For those unfamiliar with Arm, it’s a firm that licenses its architecture to other companies seeking to create their own custom chips.\\n\\nAs Nvidia and Qualcomm rip a page out of the playbook of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its Arm-based Apple Silicon strategy, it will certainly be interesting to see how the next generation of Arm CPUs stack up against one another. Rising competition in the space is a big win for consumers but another potential hit to the chin for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the former CPU giant that’s really suffered a fall from grace.\\n\\nNvidia and Qualcomm both have a lot to gain relative to what they stand to lose as they join the arms race. And for that reason, I’m bullish on both firms as they ready their CPUs for launch.\\n\\nQualcomm and Nvidia Could Gain at the Expense of Intel\\n\\nUp ahead, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite (along with its CPU core technology, Oryon) is slated to be launched in the middle of 2024. For now, Intel doesn’t seem to view Qualcomm, Nvidia, or any other Arm CPU combatant as making a dent in the laptop market.\\n\\nGiven Apple’s success with Apple Silicon and its latest M3 line of chips, I think it’s quite worrisome for Intel to downplay the credible threat of Arm CPUs. Indeed, Intel does not have much room to be complacent as the rising trend of more firms making their own custom silicon (with the help of Arm) continues to take off.\\n\\nApple has been leading the charge when it comes to custom silicon. And the per-watt performance jump from Intel-based Macs has been absolutely remarkable. In fact, Apple really encouraged its Intel-based Mac users to make the jump to Apple Silicon in its “Scary Fast” event.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFollowing in Apple’s Footsteps\\n\\nUndoubtedly, the benchmarks for the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips were most impressive when compared to the original M1 line of chips. Compared to the M2 line, performance improvements seemed rather tame. That said, given that many Mac users are still on Intel-powered Macs, the real opportunity may lie in nudging pre-Apple Silicon users to make the leap. Given the power of Apple’s ecosystem, it’s not hard to imagine many Apple fans moving to Apple Silicon and away from Intel, perhaps for good.\\n\\nAs Qualcomm and Nvidia ready their own Arm offerings for launch over the medium term, there’s a good chance that both firms could add pressure on the PC side.\\n\\nNot to discount the turnaround efforts going on at Intel, but things are not looking good for Intel in the slightest as we move into the next generation of Arm-based CPUs. Perhaps the only thing scarier than Apple (and its Scary Fast M3 chip, which was unveiled the day before Halloween 2023) is Nvidia. The GPU kingpin is one of the hottest Magnificent Seven players in recent years. And if it sets sights on Arm CPUs, I would not bet against the firm as it looks to get in on the action.\\n\\nNvidia recognized the power of Arm early in the game, with its failed attempt to acquire it around three years ago in a proposed deal worth $40 billion. Though Nvidia’s Arm acquisition hopes were called off in a hurry, the move doesn’t appear to be stopping Nvidia from pursuing its grand Arm ambitions.\\n\\nMoreover, while the relief rally in INTC stock has been going strong for around a year, I’d not be surprised if it’s cut short at the hands of Qualcomm or Nvidia.\\n\\nIs QCOM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nOn TipRanks, QCOM stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 20 analyst ratings, there are 13 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell rating. The\\xa0average Qualcomm stock price target is $135.59, implying upside potential of 9.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $100.00 per share to a high of $160.00 per share.\\n\\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\\n\\nMeanwhile, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy on TipRanks. Out of 38 analyst ratings, there are 37 Buys and one Hold recommendation. The\\xa0average Nvidia stock price target is $645.65, implying upside potential of 34.6%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $560.00 per share to a high of $1,100 per share.\\n\\nOn the high end, Rosenblatt Securities sees NVDA stock more than doubling (129% upside) from current levels to $1,100.00 per share. That’s a Street-high target and one that may not be so out of sight if Nvidia can repeat the magic with its Arm-based CPU as it continues sprinting with the AI ball.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nGetting into the Arm CPU scene has the potential to be lucrative — just ask Apple. Even if the offerings of Qualcomm or Nvidia fail to live up to the hype, it certainly seems like Arm is allowing more firms to challenge Intel. The only question is whether Intel will be able to hold its own as more punches come its way.\\n\\nDisclosure', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-qualcomm-jumping-cpu-arms-175245017.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'ARM.US', 'INL.F', 'INL.XETRA', 'INTC.MX', 'INTC.US', 'ITLC34.SA', 'NVD.F', 'NVD.XETRA', 'NVDA.MX', 'NVDA.US', 'NVDC34.SA', 'QCI.F'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.138}}, {'date': '2023-11-10T16:02:00+00:00', 'title': 'Apple releases urgent iPhone update for popular and vital feature', 'content': 'Unless you\\'ve somehow managed to buck the smartphone trend and have been blissfully living in 2007 with an old flip phone, chances are, you\\'ve grazed up against the iPhone.

It takes years of grinding in the form of research that a high level of patience should back. Daily news and temporary headwinds tend to distract investors. That’s when conviction and patience play a critical role. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the first trillion-dollar Company; others have followed. In the coming years, the markets will continue to reward quality businesses through swelling valuations. This column focuses on the potential next trillion-dollar companies to invest.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that the focus is immediately on the technology sector when we talk about trillion-dollar companies. I agree that the world of technology is dynamic, and areas like artificial intelligence and robotics have a substantial addressable market.\\n\\nI have discussed a few technology stocks in this column. At the same time, I have focused on companies that can surprise investors as potential next trillion-dollar companies. Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these stories until 2030.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nRio Tinto (RIO) a construction worker looks on as an excavator gets to work in a mine. Mining Stocks\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nInvestors will be surprised as I talk about a cyclical industrial commodity stock on the list of the next trillion-dollar companies. There are two reasons for this bullish view. First, industrial commodities are possibly the most undervalued asset class based on 20-year CAGR returns for different assets. As an asset class, commodities are likely to catch up in the coming years.\\n\\nFurther, the demand for metals supporting the global energy transition will likely surge. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is attractive from this perspective as the Company focuses on metals positioned to benefit from the focus on green energy.\\n\\nAn important point to note is that Rio has an investment-grade balance sheet. Even with weakness in commodities, the Company delivered a free cash flow of $3.7 billion for the first half of 2023. With high financial flexibility, the Company is positioned to invest aggressively in lithium, copper, and aluminum. The outlook for this 5.47% dividend yield stock is therefore bullish.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nChevron Corporation (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\\n\\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI will talk about yet another cyclical stock that represents a potential next trillion-dollar company. ChevronCorporation (NYSE:CVX) is among the best oil and gas stocks. The recent correction is an excellent opportunity to enter a stock with an attractive dividend yield of 4.18%.\\n\\nThe first reason to like Chevron is the cash flow potential. Last year, Brent oil averaged $100.9 per barrel, and the Company reported an operating cash flow of $47.5 billion. Quality assets with an attractive break-even will continue to ensure that Chevron reports robust cash flows.\\n\\nAlong with the cash flow potential, Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet. Recently, the Company announced the acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES). Organic and acquisition-driven growth will ensure that production and cash flows continue to swell. Once Hess is acquired, Chevron expects to invest $19 to $22 billion annually.\\n\\nI must add here that Chevron is also investing in renewable energy projects. In the next decade, this segment will be another key growth driver for the Company.\\n\\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Retail workers checking produce at a grocery store.\\n\\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) stock is another name I would add to the list of trillion-dollar companies. In my view, Costco is possibly the best bet among retail stocks. Of course, the company does not have an asset-light model, which is preferred nowadays when scanning for massive value creators.\\n\\nHowever, there are two primary reasons to like Costco. First, the United States economy is driven by consumption spending. An essential part of this is retail expenditure. Costco will, therefore, continue to benefit from a robust omnichannel presence.\\n\\nFurther, Costco had 697 warehouses in the U.S. and Canada as of Q4 2023. The Company, however, has only five warehouses in China. There is ample scope for expansion in emerging Asia, and that’s a potential growth driver for the coming decade.\\n\\nI must add that Costco reported $4.6 billion in membership revenue in the last financial year. This revenue will likely continue to swell as the Company expands present. Robust recurring revenue will support value creation.\\n\\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\\n\\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI have intentionally avoided talking about technology names in the list of next trillion-dollar companies. Of course, I will discuss a few, but the focus is always on the technology sector as a massive value creator. There is ample quality outside the tech space that can deliver multi-bagger returns.\\n\\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is a potential value creator if investors are willing to buy and hold until 2030. In 2022, global defense spending increased for the eighth consecutive year to $2.24 trillion. As points of friction increase globally, defense spending will likely accelerate. LMT stock has been subdued but looks poised for a big breakout rally.\\n\\nI believe that there are three reasons to be bullish on Lockheed. First, the Company has an order backlog of $156 billion, and I expect continued acceleration in backlog, which will translate into higher cash flow.\\n\\nSecond, Lockheed is increasingly looking at international collaborations to boost growth. The Company’s recent orders include those from Norway, Korea, Philippines, among others. Additionally, Lockheed is investing in next-generation defense technology. This is likely to keep the Company ahead of the curve.\\n\\nAstraZeneca (AZN) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\\n\\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\\n\\nBiopharmaceutical stocks were in focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the sector has been ignored in a post-pandemic world, and valuations are attractive. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is one stock I believe can be a potential multi-bagger by 2030.\\n\\nFirst, I want to point out that various medical conditions are increasing globally. There is a continuous need for investment in research and development to discover drugs. As an example, globally, there were an estimated 20 million cases of cancer. Further, the cancer burden is expected to increase by 60% over the next two decades.\\n\\nComing to AstraZeneca, the Company has a deep pipeline of 172 projects. The pipeline of new molecular entities is for conditions that include oncology, respiratory, immunology, cardiovascular, and rare diseases, among others. A strong pipeline provides growth visibility for the coming years.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that the Company has 30 potential Phase Three trials for the year. Of this, there are ten potential blockbuster opportunities. I would, therefore, remain bullish on healthy growth in the next few years.\\n\\nSalesforce (CRM) Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock is an interesting bet among the potential trillion-dollar companies from the technology sector. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.3, CRM stock looks attractive and is poised to trend higher.\\n\\nAs an overview, Salesforce is a provider of customer relationship management technology. This description does not do complete justice to the Company’s potential with artificial intelligence likely to boost CRM growth. That’s one factor that still needs to be discounted in the stock.\\n\\nFrom a financial perspective, it’s worth mentioning that Salesforce reported an operating cash flow of $5.3 billion for the first half of 2024. With an annual OCF potential of more than $10 billion, there is ample headroom to create value. Further, a strong cash buffer allows Salesforce to invest 3% to 4% of sales towards research and development.\\n\\nAnother critical point is that for Q2 2024, Salesforce reported 24% year-on-year revenue growth from Asia Pacific (APAC). This is significantly higher than the total revenue growth of 11%. Emerging markets will continue to be growth drivers in the coming years.\\n\\nLi Auto (LI) Solid State Battery for EV Electric Vehicle, new research and development batteries with solid electrolyte energy storage for automotive car industry, cathode. 3d illustration. Top Battery Stocks to Buy\\n\\nSource: Just_Super / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) would be my wildest bet for the next trillion-dollar companies. Of course, I don’t expect it to happen anytime soon as I discuss 25x returns from current levels. However, I do believe that LI stock can create millionaires among investors willing to hold with patience for the next five to seven years.\\n\\nOne thing I like the most about Li Auto is that the Company executes its strategy perfectly. While few other Chinese EV stocks are pursuing aggressive global expansion, Li Auto is pursuing aggressive expansion within China. This is delivering results in the form of stellar delivery growth, and a narrow focus (for now) ensures that costs don’t go through the roof.\\n\\nTo put things into perspective, Li Auto reported a cash buffer of $12.13 billion as of Q3 2023. Further, the free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion. Strong FCF allows the Company to invest in innovation and aggressive retail expansion. An annualized FCF potential of $6 to $8 billion indicates that the business is already a cash flow machine.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)', 'content': 'Key Insights\\n\\nApple\\'s estimated fair value is US$161 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$182 suggests Apple is potentially trading close to its fair value Our fair value estimate is 17% lower than Apple\\'s analyst price target of US$195\\n\\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won\\'t be able to understand it, just read on! It\\'s actually much less complex than you\\'d imagine.\\n\\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nThe Method\\n\\nWe\\'re using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company\\'s growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\\n\\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today\\'s dollars:\\n\\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\\n\\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$109.9b US$116.7b US$128.0b US$145.2b US$158.1b US$167.8b US$176.1b US$183.3b US$189.9b US$195.9b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x11 Analyst x5 Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Est @ 6.13% Est @ 4.96% Est @ 4.13% Est @ 3.56% Est @ 3.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2%  US$101.5k US$99.6k US$101.0k US$105.8k US$106.5k US$104.4k US$101.2k US$97.4k US$93.2k US$88.8k\\n\\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\\r\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1t\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \\'growth\\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\\'s value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.\\n\\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$196b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.2%) = US$3.3t\\n\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$1.5t\\n\\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$182, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\\n\\nImportant Assumptions\\n\\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don\\'t have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\\'ve used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.201. Beta is a measure of a stock\\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\\n\\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\\n\\nStrength\\n\\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\\n\\nWeakness\\n\\nEarnings declined over the past year.\\n\\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\\n\\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\\n\\nOpportunity\\n\\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\\n\\nThreat\\n\\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\\n\\nMoving On:\\n\\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn\\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It\\'s not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The ruling is now subject to President Biden\\'s review, who must decide whether to allow or veto the ban by Dec. 25.\\n\\nThe quasi-judicial body, which adjudicates trade-related disputes, found that Apple infringes on blood-oxygen-monitoring technology invented by Masimo, a smaller California-based medical technology company. Meanwhile, Apple claimed that Masimo is trying to keep Apple Watches from U.S. consumers, \"while making way for their own watch that copies Apple.\"\\n\\nImport bans are a potent remedy–but they’re necessary to keep infringing goods from entering the U.S. market and protect companies from intellectual property theft.\\n\\nAfter all, if companies–whether foreign or domestic–can steal American firms\\' technology, incorporate it into their products, manufacture those goods in China and other competitor nations, and then import them at will, it would undermine U.S. firms\\' willingness to invest in new products. Innovation, job creation, and economic growth would all suffer.\\n\\nUnfortunately, some in Congress are trying to neuter the ITC\\'s power to crack down on patent theft. While these lawmakers are trying to help giant corporations, they are also helping America\\'s rivals in the process. Our elected officials should do neither.\\n\\nLawmakers are considering the Advancing America\\'s Interests Act, which would weaken the ITC\\'s exclusion orders by first requiring the agency to \"affirmatively determine that any exclusion serves the public interest.\" In practice, the requirement would prevent the ITC from barring the importation of patent-infringing goods except in the rarest of cases.\\n\\nConsider the Apple-Masimo example. Unlike U.S. courts, the ITC doesn\\'t award monetary damages. So if the law changes and the ITC can no longer stop Apple Watch imports, the judgment against Apple would be rendered meaningless–all bark and no bite. Apple will be free to steal Masimo\\'s technology, make infringing watches overseas, and then import them into the United States, depriving Masimo of the market it wants to develop for its inventions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor small innovators, stopping the sale of patent-infringing products is what matters. The court system offers only partial justice. If a small firm sues over patent infringement in a U.S. court and wins, the court will generally only award some monetary damages–they generally don\\'t order large infringers to pull the offending product off the market.\\n\\nAs long as the infringing products remain on the market, the violator still profits. Very large companies sometimes deliberately infringe smaller rivals\\' patents, figuring that court-ordered damages are a worthwhile price to pay for appropriating a promising product and undercutting a smaller competitor before it can grow into a true threat.\\n\\nThat\\'s why the ITC\\'s ability to bar patent-violating goods is critical: It provides a significant consequence that makes corporate behemoths think twice before opting for an \"efficient infringement\" strategy.\\n\\nAbsent such a penalty, large companies are encouraged to conduct more manufacturing abroad, knowing that they can play fast and loose with IP rules. And their Chinese partners and suppliers stand to benefit too, as they gain jobs and profits. Without robust exclusion orders, foreign patent infringement entering the U.S. market can be expected to increase, leaving U.S. firms with little to no recourse.\\n\\nIronically, the Advancing America\\'s Interests Act would sabotage the ongoing work of the \"Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party,\" a bipartisan House of Representatives effort to address, among other matters, Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property. Chinese IP theft costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars, harming IP-intensive industries that employ millions of Americans. This theft needs to be stopped, and legislators need to make it easier–not harder–to prevent such infringing products from entering the United States.\\n\\nIt\\'d be the height of hypocrisy for members of Congress to talk tough about Chinese IP theft in one committee room while making it easier for China to violate American firms\\' intellectual property rights in another.\\n\\nPut simply, the ITC stops patent infringement. That\\'s why the ITC\\'s ruling–and its authority–must remain intact.\\n\\nAndrei Iancu served as the undersecretary of Commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from 2018 to 2021.

As many long-time listeners of the podcast know, Tracey is not an Apple investor. Nor does she use its products. That’s right. She does not own an iPhone, and never has.\\n\\nBut after Apple reported the fourth straight quarterly sales decline, the first time it has done so since 2001, Tracey decided to look at Apple’s sales and earnings estimates.\\n\\nApple has been one of the best performing stocks of the last 20 years. As of Sep 2023, $10,000 invested 20 years ago, with dividends reinvested, was worth $5.08 million. And it keeps hitting new all-time highs.\\n\\nBut is the 20-year bull market in the stock about to end?\\n\\nWhat Happens When Tech Growth Slows\\n\\n1. Apple Inc. AAPL\\n\\nApple went public in 1980. It’s been a wild ride. In the 1990s, it was just 30 days away from bankruptcy before it got a bailout from Bill Gates and Microsoft. Apple went on to make some of the most iconic products of the century including the iPod, the iPad and, of course, the iPhone.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut in fiscal 2023, growth slowed. In the fourth quarter, iPhone sales only rose 2.8% year-over-year.\\n\\nApple’s revenue is expected to rise just 3.1% in fiscal 2024 with earnings growing 6.7%. That might be fine if the stock was cheap, but it’s not. Apple trades with a forward P/E of 27.4 and a P/S ratio of 7.3.\\n\\nWhat valuation are you willing to pay for Apple’s single digit growth?\\n\\n2. SONY Corp. SONY\\n\\nSONY is not a stranger to having iconic products. In 1979, it launched a new handheld cassette player it called the “Walkman.” By 1999, SONY had sold 186 million of the Walkmans and the name “Walkman” became synonymous with ANY handheld cassette player with earphones.\\n\\nUltimately, the iPod and other MP3 players led to the Walkman’s demise. But SONY has plenty of other divisions, including gaming, music, cameras, and entertainment, to make up for it.\\n\\nSONY’s growth has also slowed. It is expected to see revenue fall 1.4% in fiscal 2024 and earnings to gain just 1.3%. But i’s valuation is also much cheaper. SONY trades with a forward P/E of just 15.7. I’s P/S ratio is only 1.3.\\n\\nIs this a buying opportunity in SONY?\\n\\n3. IBM Corp. IBM\\n\\nIBM was the dominant technology company of the 1960s and 70s. At one point, it produced 80% of computers in the United States. But by 2005, it had exited the PC business altogether.\\n\\nIBM’s growth has also slowed. In 2023, it’s expected to grow revenue by just 1.1% and earnings by 3.3%. However, like SONY, it also has attractive valuations. IBM trades with a forward P/E of just 15.8 and a P/S ratio of 2.2.\\n\\nBut it’s the juicy dividend, currently yielding 4.5%, that attracts a lot of investors.\\n\\nShould income investors have IBM on their short list?\\n\\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Apple?\\n\\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\\n\\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Elsewhere, trade in the U.S. Treasury market is disrupted by a cyberattack on China\\'s largest commercial lender by assets, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) agrees to pay out a $25 million settlement over claims regarding its U.S. immigrant hiring practices.\\n\\n1. Futures mixed\\n\\nU.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday after the benchmark S&P 500 ended an eight-day winning streak in the prior session.\\n\\nBy 04:40 ET (09:40 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 32 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures were mostly flat, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched down by 43 points or 0.3%.\\n\\nThe main indices on Wall Street finished lower on Thursday, as investors digested fresh commentary on the Federal Reserve\\'s monetary policy path from Chair Jerome Powell (more below).\\n\\nThe S&P 500 fell by 0.8%, bringing the curtain down on its longest series of consecutive positive days in two years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped by 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively.\\n\\nRattling investors in particular was a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, with the longer-dated 10-year and 30-year yields both edging up by over 10 basis points. Yields typically move inversely to prices.\\n\\n2. Powell \"not confident\" policy stance is restrictive enough\\n\\nMarkets were focused on remarks on Thursday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who suggested that the U.S. central bank may have more work to do to bring inflation down to its stated 2% target.\\n\\nSpeaking at an International Monetary Fund event in Washington D.C., Powell said that while a recent cooling in price pressures is encouraging, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to achieving a \"sufficiently restrictive\" policy stance.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"[W]e are not confident that we have achieved such a stance,\" he said in a prepared statement.\\n\\nIt was the latest sign that the Fed could be open to further interest rates hikes, potentially denting nascent investor optimism that policymakers may have finished their long-standing tightening campaign. At its latest meeting last week, the FOMC voted to leave the all-important Fed funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%.\\n\\n3. Ransomware attack hits China\\'s ICBC\\n\\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has said that its financial services arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trade in the U.S. Treasury market, according to multiple media reports.\\n\\nICBC Financial Services, the U.S. branch of the bank, reportedly noted that it is looking into the matter and is making progress in recovering from it.\\n\\nIt also said that Treasury trades carried out on Wednesday and repurchase agreements for trades done on Thursday had been successfully cleared. According to Reuters, some market participants had found that trades going through ICBC had not been settled due to the attack, which aims to paralyze a computer system until a ransom is paid.\\n\\nA spokesperson for China\\'s foreign ministry told reporters at a news conference that ICBC is \"closely monitoring\" the situation, adding that it is doing its best to minimize the damage from the attack. Business was continuing as normal at other ICBC offices around the world, the spokesperson said.\\n\\n4. Apple agrees to $25 million settlement over U.S. immigrant hiring practices\\n\\nApple is set to pay up to $25 million to settle claims from the U.S. Department of Justice that it favored hiring immigrant workers over American citizens and legal green card holders for some jobs.\\n\\nThe DOJ claimed in a statement that Apple had engaged in a \"pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination\" in recruitment for positions it hired through a federal program allowing employers to sponsor immigrant workers for green cards. The tech giant did not recruit U.S. citizens or permanent residents for jobs that were eligible for the program and had instead favored candidates with temporary work visas, the DOJ said.\\n\\nIn response, Apple said that it had \"unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard,\" adding that it is implementing a \"robust remediation plan.\"\\n\\nThe California-based company will be required to pay $6.75 million in civil fines and $18.25 million to an unspecified number of impacted workers, in the biggest-ever settlement for the DOJ involving claims of discrimination based on citizenship.\\n\\n5.

Well, you may just have that chance again today with quantum computing stocks.\\n\\nThe futuristic field of quantum computing has faced some bumps on its road to mainstream adoption lately. The recent Nasdaq correction has hit many once-hot quantum computing stocks hard. But this correction also presents a golden buying opportunity for investors who take the long view.\\n\\nQuantum computing may sound like science fiction, but it’s likely to become a commercial reality sooner than you think. Leading experts predict quantum computers will reach the tipping point of usefulness within this decade. When that happens, early investors could be richly rewarded.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe problem is, quantum computing technology is highly complex and many companies trading in this space have business models that are speculative. We’re in the early innings of this technological revolution, so plenty of quantum stocks carry substantial risk.\\n\\nHowever, the long-term growth prospects in quantum computing are too great to ignore. Quantum computing could drive massive progress in fields like AI, materials science, cryptography, and more. It could fundamentally reshape our digital infrastructure and lead to innovations we can’t even imagine yet.\\n\\nScooping up promising quantum computing stocks now, while they’re under pressure and trading at a discount, could put you firmly on the path to long-term wealth creation. Let’s dive in!\\n\\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\\n\\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOf all the quantum computing stocks, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) strikes me as one of the safer yet potentially lucrative options for investors. Naturally, the quantum computing market is highly-volatile and speculative at this early stage. However, Honeywell has stood out from the pack thanks to its ties to the defense and aerospace industries. The company has been a prime beneficiary of higher defense spending in cutting-edge areas like aerospace and intelligence. With geopolitical tensions rising, Honeywell’s government business seems poised for further growth.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat said, Honeywell also has an intriguing pure-play quantum computing segment called Honeywell Quantum. Since its formation in 2021, Honeywell Quantum has quickly become a quantum computing leader. It recently became the first company to “integrate quantum-computing-hardened encryption keys into smart meters for gas, water and electric utilities”\\n\\nWhile HON stock has sagged recently amid a broader market downturn (and a revenue miss in its latest quarter), I view this as a buying opportunity. At 20-times forward earnings, Honeywell seems attractively-priced, given its leading positions in must-have aerospace and defense technologies. The company generates mountains of recurring revenue and cash flow to support future R&D and growth initiatives like quantum computing. The company aims to launch a powerful quantum computer called Model H1 in 2023.\\n\\nFor a relatively low-risk play on the quantum computing revolution, Honeywell fits the bill nicely. The company offers stability from its government-contracted businesses, while also providing upside from emerging technologies like quantum computing.\\n\\nIONQ (IONQ) A concept image showing a quantum computer with a matrix background; quantum computing. leading quantum stocks, quantum computing stocks to buy\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nIf you desire a pure-play quantum computing stock, look no further than IONQ (NYSE:IONQ). Since going public, IONQ has emerged as one of the frontrunners in the quantum computing race. While very speculative, IONQ offers tantalizing growth potential.\\n\\nIONQ has pioneered the use of trapped ions to construct quantum computers. This approach aims to minimize error rates and heating effects compared to rival technologies. The company uses ytterbium atoms suspended in electromagnetic fields for its qubits. Thus far, the results look highly promising.\\n\\nEarlier this year, IONQ unveiled its next-generation quantum computer called Forte. With a planned 32 algorithmic qubits, it would be the world’s most powerful trapped ion-based quantum computer on the market. Previously, IONQ’s systems were only accessible via the cloud. However, Forte will also be available as an on-premise solution for select partners. This quarter, IONQ achieved a major milestone by reaching quantum volume 29.\\n\\nLet’s put the good news on the sidelines for now. There are a lot of caveats with this company, but my biggest problem with IONQ is unprofitability. Currently, its balance sheet held over $509 million in cash against $44 million in losses in the most recent quarter. Profitability remains years away, as product development costs weigh heavily on its bottom line.\\n\\nAnother big caveat for me is the stock’s massive volatility. Unless you are okay with that sort of risk and are willing to hold for years, I would recommend you avoid pure plays like these and focus more on the two other stocks in this list.\\n\\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBack to the established giants on this list, IBM (NYSE:IBM) looks ideally positioned to capitalize on the commercialization of quantum computing. Indeed, if any company can make quantum computing mainstream, IBM seems like the top contender.\\n\\nWhile much less speculative than pure plays, IBM still offers substantial upside potential, in my view. The company operates the IBM Quantum Network, which allows customers to access IBM’s advanced quantum computing systems. Over 210 Fortune 500 companies leverage this network for research and education. As quantum computing grows more practical, IBM’s massive customer base gives it an enormous head start over rivals.\\n\\nAdditionally, IBM continues pushing the boundaries on quantum computing performance. Last year, it unveiled its new Osprey processor, which has a quantum volume of 128, double its previous system. IBM aims to launch a 1,121-qubit quantum computer this year, more than doubling its power again. Indeed, IBM may very well become the first to develop quantum computers powerful enough for mainstream business and scientific use.\\n\\nBesides its growth upside, IBM also offers safety. At just 16-times earnings, IBM is cheap compared to other large tech firms. It generates prodigious free cash flow to support both growing the quantum business and rewarding shareholders.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, since then, AAPL stock has gotten back on an upward trajectory, suggesting investors are focusing now more on the tech giant’s solid results, and the prospect of demand for the company’s products and services continuing to bounce back.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs CEO Tim Cook discussed in the earnings release, Apple reported record iPhone and Services sales for the quarter. Earnings per share jumped 13% year over year, and results came in ahead of sell-side forecasts. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for AAPL is 22.3%, which makes it a medium risk stock.\\n\\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been in the “Green Zone” for over five months. Like other tech stocks, shares in the enterprise software provider pulled back slightly during the late summer and early fall, as macroeconomic concerns like high interest rates and a possible 2024 recession weighed on the markets.\\n\\nYet with investor sentiment bouncing back, CRM stock has begun climbing back toward its 52-week high. Salesforce’s next earnings results may bode well for shares from here. Why? Although analysts have already upped their forecasts for last quarter, the company could still report an earnings topper.\\n\\nIf Salesforce beats these forecasts, provides an upward revision to full-year guidance, or unveils more details about its efforts to capitalize on the generative AI trends, current price trends may continue following earnings. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for CRM is 28.47%, which makes it a medium risk stock.\\n\\nYelp (YELP) yelp app on a mobile phone with headphones\\n\\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nYelp (NYSE:YELP) has been in the “Green Zone” for over five months. So far this year, shares in the consumer review portal operator have performed strongly, which has made it one of the tech stocks to buy. This comes following an extended period of underperformance during 2021 and 2022.\\n\\nWhat’s been driving this strong performance for YELP stock in 2023? While at first zooming higher after the emergence of activist investor involvement in the stock back in May, the reporting of strong quarterly results and updates to outlook have helped to extend this rally.\\n\\nEven as YELP has rallied by roughly 60% year to date, given improving results, a relatively low valuation (13 times forward earnings), and the continued push from the above-mentioned activist to sell the company, present trends could continue. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for YELP is 31.66%, which makes it a high risk stock.\\n\\nThe TradeSmith Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\n\\nTradeSmith’s mission is to put easy-to-use, technology-based tools into the hands of individual, self-directed investors.

Buy Apple ETFs for These 5 Factors', 'content': \"Apple AAPL posted impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results last week, but its Q1 outlook disappointed investors. While Apple topped expectations for revenues, earnings and iPhone sales, investors remained cautious due to concerns about iPhone sales weakness in China (a key market for Apple) and a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline.\\n\\nShould You Really Care About China?\\n\\nWhile likely sales slowdown in China is a concern, investors should not overlook other booming areas. Let’s highlight those emerging fields.\\n\\nIndia: A Rising Star in Apple’s Portfolio\\n\\nApple’s investments in India have been strategic and have already started to pay off. Despite making up only 4% of total iPhone sell-through in the 12 months prior to September 2023, unit sales in India increased a massive 31%. This growth stands in contrast to declines in major markets like the United States, China and Europe, per UBS analyst David Vogt, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nApple's CEO, Tim Cook, highlighted the importance of India as a budding market with immense prospects. He mentioned that Apple expects more people to enter the middle class in India, which could boost the company's presence in the country.\\n\\nServices Business Resilience Amid Hardware Struggles, AI Investments in Place\\n\\nApple's Services business confirmed consistent growth, offsetting declining hardware sales and promising strong performance in 2024. The Services portfolio, which includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. The services segment may make up for falling iPhone sales.\\n\\nDuring Apple's Q4 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the company's recent advancements in AI technology, showcasing features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail in iOS 17 as examples. Cook also confirmed Apple's active involvement in generative AI technologies.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMac Sales Rebound in the Cards\\n\\nThe Mac segment has been struggling in recent quarters. Despite a 34% year-over-year revenue decline in the Mac segment in Q4, Apple anticipates a significant turnaround with the introduction of its new M3 chip-powered products.\\n\\nFor 2024, Apple anticipates potential growth opportunities with new MacBooks featuring M3 chips and the launch of the Vision Pro headset. Apple’s focus on augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies presents growth opportunities in the long haul.\\n\\nDecent Valuation & Return Prospects Compared to Industry\\n\\nGoing by valuation metrics, the P/E (ttm) of AAPL is 30.7 times versus the industry-average of 28.8 times. The forward P/E of AAPL is 28.2 times versus the industry score of 26.7 times. Though these measures point to a slightly higher valuation of Apple than the industry, a higher P/E is not always a sign of worry. It shows investors’ confidence in a particular stock among the bunch.\\n\\nInvestors should note that the return-on-equity of Apple is 160.8%, higher than the industry average of 137.9%. Return-on-assets of Apple is marginally higher than the industry measures. The estimated 3-5 year EPS growth of Apple is now 11.1% versus the industry measure of 9.4%.\\n\\nMore Upside Waiting for Price Target?\\n\\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 26 analysts, the average price target for Apple is $202.96. The forecasts range from a low of $140.00 to a high of $240.00. The average price target represents an increase of 13.24% from the last closing price of $179.23 (as of Nov 7, 2023).\\n\\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated on the basis of actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.71 a month ago based on 29 recommendations.\\n\\nOf the 29 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 58.62% and 10.34% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 58.62%, while Buy represented 10.34%.\\n\\nETFs to Tap\\n\\nAlthough the Apple stock has upside potential, investors who are still doubtful about Apple’s apparent tepid outlook, may play Apple-heavy ETFs as the basket approach minimizes company-specific risks.\\n\\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK – Apple has 22.89% exposure\\n\\nFidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC – Apple has 22.32% exposure\\n\\nVanguard Information Technology ETF VGT – Apple has 21.25% exposure\\n\\niShares Global Tech ETF IXN – Apple has 20.84% exposure\\n\\niShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW – Apple has 18.08% exposure\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to break down this development and the background for the massive tax bill.\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJASON BLIKRE: Welcome back. Apple may have to pay a $14-billion tax bill to Ireland. And that\\'s after advisors to Europe\\'s top court has come out and said, the case started way back in 2016 by the EU antitrust chief commissioner should be re-examined due to legal mistakes.\\n\\nLet\\'s bring in now, \"Yahoo Finance\\'s\" Dan Howley to give us all the details. Dan? The details.\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: That\\'s right, Jared. This goes back to as far back as 1991 and 2007. That\\'s when Ireland had some tax rulings regarding Apple and the entities that operate there with regards to taxes.\\n\\nAnd so they had a decent tax rate going there. Pretty favorable to Apple. In 2016, the EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, basically, said, look, we\\'re going to take a look at what\\'s going on here with Apple\\'s taxes. in 2020, Apple and Ireland, they went ahead and had a court decision go in their favor, basically, saying that the tax rulings were OK. They don\\'t have to pay back these billions of dollars in taxes that the European Union had said that they do.\\n\\nNow, though, there\\'s an Advocate General in the EU who basically is able to look at cases and then provide a non-binding recommendation. So what\\'s happened here is this non-binding recommendation says that, basically, the EU and Apple have to go back to the drawing board and relook at the original cases, regarding these taxes as to whether or not Apple does actually have to pay the EU billions of dollars in back taxes or not.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAgain, this is non-binding. It doesn\\'t mean that this actually has to happen. It\\'s a recommendation. So the idea that Apple is officially on the hook for anything, just isn\\'t the truth. But there is a risk now that the EU could go ahead and take that advice and actually try to relitigate what\\'s going on with the taxes there.\\n\\nAnd this has been an ongoing issue for the company and Ireland. There\\'s been discussions as to whether Ireland provides overly favorable tax rates to companies like Apple to get them to operate within the country. Obviously, drive up jobs, as well as through construction as well as people who actually work for the companies themselves.\\n\\nSo this is going to be something that\\'s really worth watching for Apple going forward.\\n\\nJASON BLIKRE: All right.

(27:15) - Taking A Look At IBM’s Long Term History: Could This Fit Into Your Portfolio Right Now? (33:30) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, SONY, IBM, VOO Podcast@Zacks.com\\n\\nWelcome to Episode #379 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\\n\\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\\n\\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to talk about Apple. As many long-time listeners of the podcast know, Tracey is not an Apple investor. Nor does she use its products. That’s right. She does not own an iPhone, and never has.\\n\\nBut after Apple reported the fourth straight quarterly sales decline, the first time it has done so since 2001, Tracey decided to look at Apple’s sales and earnings estimates.\\n\\nApple has been one of the best performing stocks of the last 20 years. As of Sep 2023, $10,000 invested 20 years ago, with dividends reinvested, was worth $5.08 million. And it keeps hitting new all-time highs.\\n\\nBut is the 20-year bull market in the stock about to end?\\n\\nWhat Happens When Tech Growth Slows\\n\\n1. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\\n\\nApple went public in 1980. It’s been a wild ride. In the 1990s, it was just 30 days away from bankruptcy before it got a bailout from Bill Gates and Microsoft. Apple went on to make some of the most iconic products of the century including the iPod, the iPad and, of course, the iPhone.\\n\\nBut in fiscal 2023, growth slowed. In the fourth quarter, iPhone sales only rose 2.8% year-over-year.\\n\\nApple’s revenue is expected to rise just 3.1% in fiscal 2024 with earnings growing 6.7%. That might be fine if the stock was cheap, but it’s not. Apple trades with a forward P/E of 27.4 and a P/S ratio of 7.3.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat valuation are you willing to pay for Apple’s single digit growth?\\n\\n2. SONY Corp. (SONY)\\n\\nSONY is not a stranger to having iconic products. In 1979, it launched a new handheld cassette player it called the “Walkman.” By 1999, SONY had sold 186 million of the Walkmans and the name “Walkman” became synonymous with ANY handheld cassette player with earphones.\\n\\nUltimately, the iPod and other MP3 players led to the Walkman’s demise. But SONY has plenty of other divisions, including gaming, music, cameras, and entertainment, to make up for it.\\n\\nSONY’s growth has also slowed. It is expected to see revenue fall 1.4% in fiscal 2024 and earnings to gain just 1.3%. But it’s valuation is also much cheaper. SONY trades with a forward P/E of just 15.7. It’s P/S ratio is only 1.3.\\n\\nIs this a buying opportunity in SONY?\\n\\n3. IBM Corp. (IBM)\\n\\nIBM was the dominant technology company of the 1960s and 70s. At one point, it produced 80% of computers in the United States. But by 2005, it had exited the PC business altogether.\\n\\nIBM’s growth has also slowed. In 2023, it’s expected to grow revenue by just 1.1% and earnings by 3.3%. However, like SONY, it also has attractive valuations. IBM trades with a forward P/E of just 15.8 and a P/S ratio of 2.2.\\n\\nBut it’s the juicy dividend, currently yielding 4.5%, that attracts a lot of investors.\\n\\nShould income investors have IBM on their short list?\\n\\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Apple?\\n\\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The rally in Big Tech has helped add about $1.5 trillion in market value to the Nasdaq 100 in recent days, suggesting a period of skepticism surrounding the pricey market leaders may be ending.\\n\\n“When it comes to what you want to see, Microsoft checks the most boxes, and checks them the most emphatically,” said Jonathan Cofsky, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. “It has a resilient business model, it is executing extremely well, it is a clear winner in AI, and overall it has the most secular tailwinds and fewer secular risks than other companies.”\\n\\nMicrosoft has risen for nine straight sessions, its longest streak in about four years. Shares have gained 15% since the end of September, making them the top performer among the seven megacaps that have powered the market’s gain this year. The advance has resulted in a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion, not far from Apple Inc., which at $2.84 trillion is the biggest public company.\\n\\nThe stock advance follows Microsoft’s results, which showed a rebound in cloud growth amid demand for artificial intelligence products, making it a highlight of an otherwise mixed season for megacap earnings.\\n\\nWhile Wall Street never exactly soured on big tech, there were concerns about the group’s valuation and growth potential going into this earnings season. Those fears saw some validation in Alphabet Inc.’s tepid cloud results, or weak sales for Apple out of China.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNow, however, sentiment seems to be shifting back. Part of that reflects a rosier view of monetary policy, as the latest jobs report suggested the Federal Reserve may be done raising rates. That has led to Treasury yields retreating from multi-year highs, easing what had been a major headwind to tech valuations.\\n\\nMicrosoft Eyes Apple’s Spot as World’s Largest Stock: Tech Watch\\n\\n“I think we’ve seen a peak in Treasury yields, which will help with sentiment, especially for tech,” said Mark Martiak, managing director of investments at Alliance Global Partners.\\n\\nHe added that results like Microsoft’s “suggests we’re past the worst, in terms of fundamentals,” and that “this combination of better fundamentals and a more favorable backdrop suggests tech can not only resume its leadership role but keep it over the rest of the year.”\\n\\nHe’s not alone in that view. Oppenheimer named buying tech its top idea for the end of the year, while Truist Advisory Services upgraded the sector earlier this week, writing that its “strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and earnings should continue to support outperformance.”\\n\\nUBS Global Wealth Management concluded that based on this earnings season, “fears over tech fundamentals are unjustified,” as earnings growth should continue to support outperformance. “The quarterly results reinforce our long-term positive view on AI and the software industry in particular,” wrote Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\\n\\nMicrosoft is seen as a leader in AI, and the growth lift it got from this has contributed to rising estimates for the company. Full-year estimates for the company’s net earnings have risen by 2.4% over the past month, while revenue estimates are up 2.8% over the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nStill, the stock’s return to a record suggests that hopes remain high. Microsoft trades at 30.5 times estimated earnings, below a recent peak of 32.5, but at a sizable premium to its long-term average. Furthermore, its weight in major indexes could mean that almost everyone who wants to own it already does. According to the latest data from Bank of America, which is for September, 91% of funds own Microsoft, and it is among the most crowded stocks in the sector.\\n\\nTo Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, these are reasons to temper one’s expectations.\\n\\nInvestor enthusiasm “is well founded,” but megacaps “remain fully valued and future earnings growth expectations could be in doubt,” he wrote. The sector’s valuation premium to the S&P 500 is “not unheard of,” but “historically, tech has had a tough time outperforming the market over the subsequent 12 months at such wide valuation differentials.”\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nAdyen NV shares soared most since 2018, after the Dutch payment firm outlined new medium-term goals that are deemed more realistic and credible by Wall Street analysts. Still, the stock is 45% below a peak earlier this year after disappointing first-half results dealt a major blow to investor confidence. Rising competition from rivals like PayPal Holdings Inc. in North America and sluggish sales at its main customer eBay Inc. remain as key investor concerns.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nApple Inc. risks having to pay a €13 billion ($14 billion) tax bill to Ireland after an adviser to the European Union’s top court said the iPhone maker’s victory in an earlier challenge should be thrown out. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak was hospitalized in Mexico City, according to press reports. Nvidia Corp. will release three new artificial intelligence chips for China, according to a report from state-affiliated news outlet Chinastarmarket, after the US further restricted the Asian nation’s access to advanced semiconductors last month. Arm Holdings Plc, delivering the first earnings report since its initial public offering, gave a disappointing sales forecast as the company contends with a smartphone slump and uncertain timing for new licensing deals. Hollywood studios and the union representing some 160,000 actors reached an agreement to end a strike that’s shut down TV and film production.

It stuck with an existing forecast for operating income of ¥1.17 trillion. Notably, its prediction for music and gaming profit both surpassed analysts’ expectations.\\n\\nThe weaker yen may have played a role in propping up the numbers, given Sony’s globe-spanning business. The conglomerate continues to grapple with an uncertain global economic climate. Price discounts likely propelled sales of the marquee PS5 gaming console, reversing a slowdown in growth that emerged during the June quarter. Sony is launching a slimmer version of the device this Friday with a goal of riding sales momentum into the year-end holiday season.\\n\\nThe discounting is weighing on margins and may force Chief Operating Officer Hiroki Totoki, who began to oversee the PlayStation business last month, to implement cost-cutting measures. Already, Sony is decreasing staff at some of its major studios. Sony on Thursday reported a less-than-projected ¥263.01 billion operating income for the September quarter.\\n\\n“The result is overall a tad weak. It raised the fiscal outlook, but since operating profit remained unchanged, the outlook hike was due mostly to a weak yen,” said Kazunori Ito, equity research director at Morningstar.\\n\\nRead more: Sony’s Bungie Game Unit Cut 8% of Staff as ‘Destiny’ Play Wilted\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIto said he’d expected a better performance at Sony’s other major pillar, the smartphone image sensors it supplies Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. That division is grappling with stubbornly weak demand, while Apple’s disappointing holiday-quarter outlook revived concerns around the reception for the iPhone 15, particularly in China.\\n\\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\\n\\nSales of image sensors could recover sequentially in 2Q, boosting operating profit, but that might be partly offset by costs related to ramping up production. Longer term, Sony is beefing up capacity to try and take more than a 60% share of the image sensor market by fiscal 2025 in terms of value. The Japanese government has actively provided subsidies to chipmakers, suggesting Sony may get help adding manufacturing lines.\\n\\n- Masahiro Wakasugi, analyst\\n\\nClick here for the research.\\n\\nSony’s music business is benefiting from a shift toward streaming, which has remained resilient during an economic downturn.

Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content. We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\\n\\nOur calculations show that Apple Inc.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has set the tone, according to Jackson.\\n\\n\"I want to do it in a way that other businesses can say this isn\\'t because they’re Apple,\" said Jackson, referring to Cook\\'s direction. \"It\\'s because they understand how to make clean energy and (recyclable) materials work in the manufacturing chains and drive emissions down.\"\\n\\nApple has been aggressive among large U.S. companies in advocating for stricter public environmental policies. In September it endorsed legislation in California to require companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions, even though trade groups in the state opposed the idea that recently became law.\\n\\nUnder Jackson, formerly the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Apple was also an early backer of federal rules to require companies to disclose emissions from their value chains.\\n\\nMany other executives from large U.S. companies oppose the idea, which has not been finalized by securities regulators. Critics say it is easier for a tech company like Apple to meet such goals than it would be for corporations in more energy-intensive industries.\\n\\nIn her remarks on Wednesday, Jackson nodded at the challenges of figuring out and reporting supply-chain details. \"Even making the windmills to generate renewable energy has a carbon footprint, and so you have to account for that,\" she said.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor a recent model of the Apple Watch, the company has reduced 78% of its carbon footprint but not some 8 kilograms of emissions for each device. \"We just right now don\\'t have the ability to take care\" of that, which includes the environmental impact of transportation and logistics.\\n\\nJackson also said Apple is working with smaller processing companies to recycle rare earths and other materials. \"That\\'s somewhere Apple can invest and then help to scale and bring (other) businesses along,\" she said.\\n\\n(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin and Kenneth Li in New York and Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Daniel Wallis)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-not-passing-costs-climate-204006654.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.957, 'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.92, 'pos': 0.069}}, {'date': '2023-11-08T19:06:27+00:00', 'title': 'Apple wants a bigger slice of the $183 billion gaming market', 'content': \"Apple (AAPL) has been a force in the gaming industry for years. But it has largely kept the effort centered around its iPhone and iPad. But now the company is making a play for a larger slice of the $183 billion video game market with the launch of its latest MacBook Pro and iMac laptops and desktop.\\n\\nSure, Apple has touted its Mac gaming credentials in the past, but it’s always been more of an aside, an ancillary feature rather than its raison d'etre. And yes, Microsoft’s Windows still dominates the computer gaming market. But Apple, it seems, is making a concerted effort to push into the space, even dedicating a portion of its latest live product unveiling to highlight the Macs’ gaming chops.\\n\\nPart of Apple’s marketing campaign for the MacBook Pro and iMac, which hit the market Tuesday, focuses on their ability to handle games like “Baldur’s Gate 3” and “Lies of P” thanks to their new, more powerful M3 chips. And it’s further burnishing its gaming bonafides via ongoing relationships with Capcom, the company behind the “Resident Evil” series, as well as legendary game developer Hideo Kojima, the person behind the “Metal Gear” franchise and “Death Stranding.”\\n\\nBut Apple has an uphill battle ahead if it expects to steal a chunk of the computer gaming market from Microsoft. And that includes convincing both gamers and developers that it’s fully dedicated to becoming a major player in the space.\\n\\nApple is pushing its gaming know how\\n\\nApple’s latest MacBook Pro, which starts at $1,599, comes outfitted with a base M3 chip and 8GB of memory. It’s a decent gaming setup if you’re hoping to run titles like “Baldur’s Gate 3,” but you’ll need to step up to the M3 Pro or M3 Max, which starts at $1,999 and $3,199, respectively, if you want to get the best graphics capabilities possible out of the game. Apple's MacBook Pro is designed to run more games including 'Lies of P.' (Image: Apple) (Apple)\\n\\nTo put that into perspective, a kitted out 14-inch Alienware x14 R2 gaming laptop will cost you $2,449. Go with an 18-inch Alienware m18 gaming rig with a massive Intel Core i9 chip, 64GB of RAM, Nvidia RTX 4090 chip, and 8TB of storage, and you’ll spend $4,554.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA MacBook Pro 14-inch equipped with an M3 Max chip, 64GB of unified memory, and 2TB of storage, similar to the one I recently reviewed, will cost $4,299. That’s a massive chunk of change. But not entirely out of the realm of possibility for gamers looking for high-end performance machines.\\n\\nHardcore gamers, those who opt for very specific configurations for their systems will likely stick with Windows systems. But Apple could try to lure consumers below that segment who want a powerful system but aren’t wedded to specific setups.\\n\\n“Slightly below the hardest core gamers is a very attractive market,” explained BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan. “It would move the overall [average selling prices] up and, by the way…[Apple doesn’t] need to pay Intel any sort of tax for the CPU. So your margin structure overall starts to benefit and the more…units you can sell, the greater the leverage.”\\n\\nAnd gaming on a Mac, Mohan said, is getting more popular.\\n\\n“It's interesting, actually, if you look at Reddit threads and stuff like that, they're actually growing a fair amount in terms of the sheer number of people who are participating and looking at Mac gaming and things like that,” Mohan explained. “So it's definitely something that is starting to pick up.” Apple's latest iMac also gets the company's new M3 chip. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\\n\\nBut PC gamers, in particular, tend to opt for high-powered desktops because they offer better performance capabilities than laptops, explained Wedbush Securities’ SVP of research Matt Bryson. And the current generation iMac only comes with an M3 chip, rather than the more powerful M3 Pro or M3 Max, making it less attractive for desktop gamers.\\n\\n“Also, PC towers are upgradable, so gamers can often get 2 or 3 generations of upgrades without having to buy completely new systems,” he said. “Apple very much likes to control its environment, making upgrades difficult if not impossible.”\\n\\nUnless Apple manages to somehow change the high-end gaming business through some new kind of product, like its upcoming Vision Pro headset, Bryson explained, the segment isn’t going to be much of a driving factor for the company.\\n\\nApple needs developers to buy in\\n\\nIf Apple is truly dedicated to making gaming a part of its broader Mac business, or even just a means of moving high-end Macs, it’s going to need to get more developers on board. While Larian Studios offers a version of “Baldur’s Gate 3” for the Mac, giving Apple owners access to one of the most talked about games of 2023, the vast majority of computer games never come to Mac.\\n\\nSure, you can play Apple Arcade games on the Mac, but big-budget titles like the latest “Call of Duty” are unlikely to land on the company’s Macs anytime soon. Computer game developers and publishers want to target the largest number of gamers, and, unfortunately for Apple, that means gearing their titles toward PC owners.\\n\\nThis became especially clear when Valve, the head of the popular Steam online gaming platform, dropped support for its “Counter-Strike 2” for the Mac. The company said it decided to ditch the platform because there simply weren’t enough Mac gamers playing the popular title.\\n\\nBut if Apple continues to push gaming on the Mac and reaches out to more developers in the coming years, it could eventually serve as a viable alternative to Windows PCs. Getting there, however, will take time.\\n\\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

However, it can’t be stressed enough that U.S. companies are very adept at using European rules to target their own national rivals.\\n\\nWhen Google got hit with a $2.7 billion antitrust fine over its comparison-shopping practices, Microsoft—previously a prime target for EU antitrust enforcers itself—was partly responsible. That $5 billion Google fine relating to Android? The complainants included Expedia, TripAdvisor, Oracle, and Microsoft, again. Yelp has complained about Google. Slack has complained about Microsoft. And now Google is trying to wield EU law against Apple.\\n\\nAs I wrote about a month ago, Google has for a while been trying to shame Apple into breaking down the walls around iMessage through the adoption of the Rich Communications Services standard, so Android and iOS users can send one another messages with all the modern bells and whistles using their phones’ native messaging apps. I also noted that the European Commission is trying to establish whether the EU’s new Digital Markets Act antitrust law should apply to iMessage, which would mean forced interoperability. (The DMA already definitely applies to the App Store, and Apple just acknowledged in its 2023 10-K filing that it may have to reform app distribution on iOS.)\\n\\nThe Financial Times reported today that Google is actively lobbying the Commission to bring iMessage under the DMA’s purview—and it’s doing so together with EU telecoms giants Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, Orange, and Telefónica.\\n\\n“It is paramount that businesses can reach all their customers taking advantage of modern communications services with enriched messaging features,” Google and the telcos reportedly wrote in a joint letter to the Commission. “Through iMessage, business users are only able to send enriched messages to iOS users and must rely on traditional SMS for all the other end users.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGoogle and the EU telecoms operators are strange bedfellows, given that they’ve recently been at each other’s throats over so-called “fair share” payments from Big Tech to Big Network—a failed concept, for now—but hey, that’s business.\\n\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of Europe, we’ve just published the inaugural Fortune 500 Europe list. As Peter Vanham points out in today’s CEO Daily essay, the top pure tech firm in the list is SAP, all the way down at No. 114. That speaks volumes.\\n\\nMore news below.

With the rise of the tech titans, more and more of the market’s total capitalization has gone to just a few firms such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while leaving small companies in the dust.\\n\\nHowever, these things tend to run in cycles. And, over the longer-term, investing firm MSCI has found that small-caps outperform the rest of the market. That’s especially true when coming out of a recession — meaning that small-caps could be entering a sweet spot for superior returns in the next year or two.\\n\\nPart of the reason why small-caps have struggled recently is a lack of growth as compared to large tech firms. However, the Russell 2000 Index contains, as its name would suggest, two thousand companies. There are some growth gems among them. Here are three small-cap stocks to own with sizzling growth rates in recent years.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nVicor (VICR) A vector illustration of a battery with neon lines swirling it; forever battery. promising battery stocks\\n\\nSource: MarySan / Shutterstock\\n\\nVicor (NASDAQ:VICR) designs and manufactures modular power components. These are used for converting, controlling and regulating power supplies for a goods in a variety of industries including aerospace, defense, telecommunications, and transportation among others.\\n\\nThe firm has grown rapidly in recent years as markets such as telecom and electrical vehicles have driven a great increase in demand for power components. Indeed, VICR stock shot up from $60 to more than $90 this summer on a blisteringly hot earnings report. But things have gone in reverse now.\\n\\nVICR stock tumbled in October following a solid earnings report. The decline came due to a weak bookings number, suggesting that the current lag in industrial activity is hitting Vicor’s business. It’s true that the company may see its rapid earnings growth cool off in 2024.\\n\\nBut the longer-term story should reassert itself once things pick back up. VICR stock is now under $40 per share, which is a massive drawdown from where it was just a few months ago. That seems overblown given the firm’s strong track record of earnings and revenue growth in recent years.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFirst Bancorp (FBP) Image of a grey cityscape with a large corporate building that features the word bank on it\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nFirst Bancorp (NYSE:FBP) is the holding company for FirstBank Puerto Rico. This is one of the relatively few banks that serves the Puerto Rican market.\\n\\nWhile Puerto Rico is part of the United States, it is technically an unincorporated territory. As such, it operates under a much different legal and economic framework than the 50 states of the country. In addition, Puerto Ricans primarily speak Spanish rather than English. Given these factors, most U.S. banks have little interest in the Puerto Rican market, leaving it to a handful of local banks specialized in that jurisdiction’s particular needs.\\n\\nPuerto Rico went through hard times. Between an economic bust and multiple devastating hurricanes, Puerto Rico’s economy slumped and much of its population left during the 2010s.\\n\\nHowever, the island has enjoyed a recovery since 2020. Between becoming a COVID-19 remote work beneficiary, the island’s tax-favored status has also attracted numerous wealthy investors who have taken up residence there.\\n\\nThrow in a favorable interest rate environment, and First Bancorp has seen its net interest income soar more than 50% since 2017. It earns a net interest margin (NIM) of 4.4%, which is far above the median U.S. regional bank. And its isolated geographical market should keep it safe from the deposit flight that plagued some mainland U.S. banks this year. All that makes FBP stock a great play on Puerto Rico’s continuing revival.\\n\\nLivent (LTHM) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\\n\\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\\n\\nLivent (NYSE:LTHM) is a specialty chemical company focused on the production of lithium.\\n\\nLike many lithium firms, Livent has enjoyed incredible growth in recent years. Livent’s revenues soared from $388 million in 2019 to $813 million last year, with additional growth expected for full-year 2023.\\n\\nLivent built its business on a highly-profitable low-cost series of lithium deposits in Argentina. Additionally, the firm is planning to merge with Allkem to add to and diversify its operations. At the moment, LTHM stock goes for less than 8x forward earnings.\\n\\nDespite the positives, shares have gotten pummeled this year amid a large sell-off in the spot lithium market. That’s a headwind, to be certain. But it appears to be far overdone. Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein believes Livent shares are worth an amazing $38/share compared to their current $14 share price today.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I am worried about the office sector and I am worried about the retail sector.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDoubleLine founder & CEO Jeffrey Gundlach on the economy\\n\\n\"We have a lot of major indicators that have been in recessionary signaling for a year plus. And so I think the Fed has stopped raising interest rates. I don\\'t think they will do it again. That is clearly the message from the bond market. The thing that worries me the most is the concept of higher-for-longer rates. And not so much for the economy. But because once the economy starts to noticeably weaken, it seems like is almost happening in real time, the Fed will cut interest rates.\"\\n\\nAT&T CEO John Stankey on the deficit\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s [the deficit] a problem today. I don\\'t think it\\'s a problem 30 years from now. What a day reckoning is constituted by, I don\\'t know that we can pick a day and say things are going to trip. I think the day of reckoning is we\\'ll end up in a prolonged period of sub-optimal growth. You can even go a step further and say if you don\\'t get your fiscal house in order, does it challenge your ability to grow the economy fast enough to be able to things to have influence outside the US and make sure the world stays safe.\"\\n\\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini on the Fed\\'s actions\\n\\n\"The question is whether the economy will have a soft landing where you go back to 2% inflation without any recession, or whether there would be a soft-ish, bumpy landing with 2% inflation and you will have a short and shallow recession. I would say the jury is still out on that. The economy right now looks like in the direction of a soft landing, but interest rates are higher and higher for longer slows the economy down.\"\\n\\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

One of the key drivers of this change is the emergence of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), which enables natural and seamless interactions between humans and machines. ChatGPT uses custom-designed chips from some of the top semiconductor companies in the world, creating a symbiotic relationship between the AI and chip sectors. In this article, I will explore three semiconductor stocks that are poised to power the next chip revolution and benefit from the growth of conversational AI.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\\n\\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) needs little introduction at this point. The global leader in high-performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies has had a good year in terms of stock price appreciation as investors bet on the firm’s role in AI computing. However, as things stand currently, AMD still remains behind Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) breakthrough A100 and H100 chips that power conversational AI bots like ChatGPT.\\n\\nHowever, like I have stressed in prior articles, investors should not count AMD out even though it has yet to commercialize its MI300x GPUs. What the chipmaker has indeed been able to do throughout the past decade is challenge\\xa0Intel’s dominance in CPU market, and that can be replicated in the GPU space. The company reported Q3’2023 earnings last week and beat Wall Street estimates, while also announcing the company expects to sell $2 billion in AI chips next year. AMD’s have since then rallied more than 13.5%, and eager investors should buy in now before shares rise even further.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTSMC (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract chipmaker and has to be a part of the portfolio of any investor betting on the next chip revolution. The contract chip manufacturing produces chips for clients such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Nvidia. TSMC specializes in advanced manufacturing processes, such as 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer technologies, which enable smaller, faster and more power-efficient chips. Due to its competencies in chip manufacturing, TSMC also plays a key role as a supplier of AI chips for ChatGPT.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn their recent earnings report, TSMC, not only boosted revenue guidance but also noted the chip slump appeared to be coming to an end. This could spell good news for the coming year in terms of financial performance and valuation multiple expansion. Right now, TSMC shares trade at an attractive multiple of 15.3 times forward earnings, which is below many of its semiconductor counterparts.\\n\\nON Semiconductor (ON) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) or “Onsemi” is a leading provider of power management, analog, sensors, logic, timing, connectivity, discrete and custom devices. The company serves a diverse range of markets, including, industrial and consumer electronics, but its main focus in recent years has been power efficient solutions for electric vehicles, smart homes and IoT devices.\\n\\nThe semiconductor firm’s exposure to consumer electronics and IoT end-markets have definitely caused a slowdown in top-line growth as there has been a general pullback in consumer spending on electronics since the height of the pandemic. Onsemi’s sluggish quarterly revenue growth in 2023 is a reflection of this recent spending dynamic. However, the firm’s electric vehicle segment could be a bright spot in the coming years as consumers increasingly consider electric vehicles over combustion engine vehicles. ON shares trading at only 14.7 times forward earnings is the icing on the cake.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\\xa0Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

It generated an underwriting profit of $1.05 billion, 233% higher than its loss a year ago.\\n\\nAlthough Berkshire’s growth in operating earnings should be the story of the quarter, most people are focused on the $157 billion in cash. Warren Buffett invests that cash into short-term Treasuries. Then the company turns them over every 3-6 months, earning nearly 5% interest. That alone would generate almost $8 billion annually for the company.\\n\\nThe only bad news was $23.5 billion in losses from its investments, which included a 12% decline in the value of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) during the quarter.

It also owns NextEra Resources, the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind, solar, and battery storage.\\n\\nNextEra’s stock is down nearly 30% in 2023 and 24% over the past year. This is primarily because of its clean energy business. Higher interest rates have made large renewable energy projects more expensive.\\n\\nHowever, interest rates aren’t likely to stay this high for more than 12-24 months. Ultimately, they’ll fall, and clean energy stocks will ride the next wave of investor enthusiasm.\\n\\nAt the end of 2020, Brookfield Renewable Partner LP (NYSE:BEP) had a price-to-sales ratio of 4.2. It’s currently down to 1.3. So, counterintuitively, now is the time to spin off NextEra Resources.\\n\\nIn 2022, NEER’s 53.8% investment in NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) and its rate-regulated transmission business had $3.72 billion in revenue. At the same 2020 multiple as Brookfield, on a P/S basis, it would have a $16.6 billion market capitalization. Now, it’s not going to get that in the current environment, but it will in 24 months.\\n\\nYou go now because that ensures Florida Power and Light’s valuation is affected by the two businesses operating under one roof.

Known for its innovative products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and services like Apple Music and iCloud, Apple Inc has cultivated a robust ecosystem that integrates hardware, software, and services seamlessly. With a market cap that recently hovered around $2.68 trillion, the company's financial health and ownership structure are of paramount interest to investors.\\n\\nAs of the latest available data, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an outstanding share count of 15.55 billion. Institutional ownership stands at 5.79 billion shares, constituting 37.05% of the total shares. Meanwhile, insiders hold 17.09 million shares, accounting for 0.11% of the total share count. Delving deeper into the stock's recent performance: Assessing the Ownership Landscape of Apple Inc(AAPL)\\n\\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a decline of about 6.73% in its stock value over the past week. As of Nov 07, 2023, the stock rose by 1.75%, contrasting with its three-month return of 2.05%. A closer look reveals fluctuations in its market cap, which dropped to $2.68 trillion in the most recent quarter from $3.04 trillion in the preceding one. This volatility has sparked keen interest in the company's ownership trends.\\n\\nThis is the income breakdown of Apple Inc: Assessing the Ownership Landscape of Apple Inc(AAPL)\\n\\nInstitutional Ownership and Key Players\\n\\nApple Inc's institutional ownership history reveals the levels of trust and confidence that major players have in the company's future. As of 2023-10-31, Apple Inc's institutional ownership level is 37.05%, down from institutional ownership of 37.97% as of 2023-07-31 and down from institutional ownership of 51.07% from a year ago. Assessing the Ownership Landscape of Apple Inc(AAPL)\\n\\nAmong the most significant stakeholders, the top fund managers owning chunks of Apple Inc's stock are Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), and Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio), with 5.86%, 0.34%, and 0.01% of shares outstanding respectively.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRecent institutional trading activity paints a vivid picture of the market sentiment. During the quarter ending 2023-06-30, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm held steady at 915,560,382 shares. Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm added 417 shares, bringing its position to 52,767,677 shares. Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm also added 5 shares, bringing its position to 1,221,890 shares.\\n\\nDelving into Earnings: Past and Future\\n\\nFinancial performance remains a cornerstone of investment decisions. Over the past three years, Apple Inc's Ebitda growth averaged 20.9% per year, which is better than 65.95% of companies in the Hardware industry. This growth extends to the five-year marker, with a growth of 16.9%.\\n\\nBut past performance is only part of the story. Looking forward, the estimated earnings growth for Apple Inc is 0% per year, lower than the earnings growth of 23.2% during the past three years. The EPS Growth Rate (Future 3Y to 5Y Estimate) is projected using a combination of historical data and industry trends, factoring in company-specific elements, broader economic conditions, and anticipated market dynamics.\\n\\nInsider Ownership and Activities\\n\\nInsider ownership offers insights into the convictions of the company's board directors and C-level employees. Apple Inc's insider ownership is approximately 0.11% as of 2023-09-30, compared to insider ownership of 0.11% from a year ago, reflecting the unchanged faith of those intimately familiar with the company's operations.\\n\\nRecent insider trades provide a nuanced view of this sentiment. During the past three months, Apple Inc had 5 insider sell transactions:\\n\\nLuca Maestri, Senior Vice President, CFO sold 63,695 shares on 2023-10-09. Jeffrey E Williams, COO sold 69,785 shares on 2023-10-06. Deirdre O'Brien, Senior Vice President sold 65,536 shares on 2023-10-03. Timothy D Cook, CEO sold 240,569 shares on 2023-10-03. Katherine L. Adams, SVP, GC and Secretary sold 65,536 shares on 2023-10-03. Assessing the Ownership Landscape of Apple Inc(AAPL)\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nIn the ever-evolving realm of stocks, understanding the nuances of ownership and earnings is critical. Apple Inc's recent dip is a case study in how major players react to market shifts, and their movements offer crucial insights for potential investors. As always, a holistic view, combining both past performance and future projections, remains key to sound investment decisions.\\n\\nScreen for stocks with high Insider Cluster Buys using the following page: https://www.gurufocus.com/insider/cluster.\\n\\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The results were interesting, to say the least. The AI service predicts that 2024 will be a lot like 2023 has been. In other words, tech firms are going to lead the market, and Bard expects that investors will see the best returns by sticking with those firms.\\n\\nThere is one notable absence, though:\\xa0Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Semiconductors are expected to remain strong overall. No doubt, Bard believes that AI demand and digitization trends will keep demand strong. Let’s take a look at those stocks with me, giving my opinion of whether I agree with each of Bard’s recommendations.\\n\\nAI Stock Picks: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\\n\\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBard gave me a broad introduction to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its stock: “Nvidia is a leading semiconductor company that designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are used in a wide range of applications, including gaming, artificial intelligence, and data center computing. Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of these markets.” So, as you can see, 2024 is expected to be a continuation of 2023. That which led the markets higher this year is expected to continue in the new year.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe presumption, then, is that U.S. chip export restrictions to China will not negatively affect NVDA’s shares over the coming 15 months. I think that’s a fair assumption. Nvidia has to pivot into other markets due to the restrictions, but it appears that demand remains high enough that the mid-term won’t be negatively affected.\\n\\nThe other overarching question is that of valuation. My take is that Nvidia isn’t extremely expensive currently. Its\\xa0price-to-earnings ratio is just under 100 but has been much higher in the past. 89% of chipmakers’ stocks are cheaper, but Nvidia, I would argue, is worth that price. It’s a 99.99th percentile firm.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\\n\\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nGoogle’s own AI believes Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be one of the most dominant stocks of 2024. Its reasoning was as follows: “Alphabet is the parent company of Google, which is the world’s leading search engine and advertising platform. Alphabet is also a leader in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and self-driving cars. The firm is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of these markets.”\\n\\nI strongly agree with Bard here. I think Google’s shares are an excellent buy following the haircut it received after releasing Q3\\xa0earnings. Thus, I believe the markets have overreacted in classic fashion in this instance. Shareholders are too dependent upon Wall Street opinions and too easily swayed by them.\\n\\nGoogle’s revenues were $690 million ahead of expectations. However, the fact that cloud revenues only reached $8.4 billion instead of $8.6 billion prompted a selling frenzy. It’s an overreaction. Is Google a cloud-dependent firm, or is it a search-dependent firm? The answer is search. It was strong there and everywhere else, yet a slight issue with cloud sent it dropping by 10%. That discount won’t last for long.\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\\n\\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBard expects\\xa0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to be a top performer in 2024 based on eCommerce and cloud computing: “Amazon is the world’s largest online retailer. Amazon is also a leader in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Amazon is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce and cloud computing.”\\n\\nIt’s impossible to argue that Amazon isn’t well-positioned to benefit from secular trends. I won’t do that. That’s the broad strength of the tech giants in a nutshell: They are exposed to massive, sustainable growth trends and have the resources to steer those markets. It applies to Amazon and all the other tech titans.\\n\\nI just got done stating that Wall Street’s analysts are often wrong, so let me contradict myself. They believe AMZN shares have a 40% upside currently. Gurufocus, a metrics-heavy analytics firm, believes it’s closer to 50%. AWS is doing better than Google but lags behind Azure growth-wise of late. AI is the theme into 2024, and Amazon has a very strong horse in that race with AWS cloud.\\n\\nAI Stock Picks: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\\n\\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn’t going anywhere in 2024. Its stock is expected to be among the best performers by just about everyone. Bard notes: “Microsoft is a leading software company that produces a wide range of products, including the Windows operating system, the Office suite of productivity applications, and the Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of cloud computing and the digital transformation of businesses.”\\n\\nWhile I generally agree with that sentiment, I’m not so sure that Microsoft is going to be a ‘top’ performer in 2024. What I mean is that it simply doesn’t have as much upside at the moment. That’s true because Microsoft hasn’t faltered much at all. It has been the heaviest AI investor among the tech titans. That investment has paid off, keeping shares steadily strong.\\n\\nInvest in Microsoft with the expectation of growth in 2024, but it’s leading, and that means others are playing catch up. MSFT shares have less upside because of that. When it does well, it’s expected, and shares don’t explode upward. If it doesn’t, it stands to lose more. It’s still a great stock, and it’s just that I don’t see why it should be a great performer for those reasons.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\\n\\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI think\\xa0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) strategy is destined to create large gains for owners of its stock in 2024. Bard cites exactly what you’d expect: “Meta Platforms is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta is the world’s leading social media company. Meta is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of social media and the digital advertising market.”\\n\\nAd revenues have rebounded in 2023, and that’s the core driver of the company. The prevailing 9-month and 3-month periods continue to show strong improvement following a difficult 2022. Ad revenue over the last 9 months eclipsed $93 billion. It was only $82 billion a year ago during the same period.\\n\\nAI promises to improve ad targeting, which should theoretically lead to further increases in ad revenues. What I also like is that Meta showed its strongest quarterly growth since its rebrand. It is dedicated to the metaverse, and that doesn’t look like such a terrible decision currently. The firm streamlined operations, cut costs, grew its top line rapidly, and continues to do all of that while funding the metaverse.\\n\\nAI Stock Picks: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\\n\\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of the electric vehicle market. Its position as the leader in that market is a positive factor leading into 2024.\\n\\nI’m afraid I have to disagree with Bard’s recommendation here. Yes, Tesla is the dominant EV manufacturer. Yes, EVs are here to stay. However, Tesla is facing several issues that are going to hold its growth down. Trade tensions are one of the strongest factors in that regard. The tit-for-tat export restrictions between the U.S. and China directly affect Tesla. A day after the U.S. restricted chip exports to China, China curbed graphite exports to the U.S. Graphite is a key component in battery production, so Tesla’s costs just took a hit.\\n\\nThat’s an especially troublesome problem for Tesla as it grapples with increased market share by lowering prices. It serves to knock its margins down further and, in my opinion, will serve to throttle TSLA’s upside potential into 2024.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBard believes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) stock in 2024 because it “is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. TSMC produces chips for a wide range of companies, including Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. TSMC is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of the semiconductor market.”\\n\\nWhile TSM is clearly among the most important firms globally, its shares don’t have the growth potential to justify Bard’s recommendation — at least not per Wall Street’s\\xa0expectations.\\n\\nI think Taiwan Semiconductor can produce much greater returns than those consensus projections for 2024. The firm’s\\xa0revenues are expected to grow by $14 billion, rising above $80 billion in 2024.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor gave a weak outlook following slowing quarter-over-quarter growth earlier this summer. A lot can change over a year, so I personally don’t care about that news. I do care that TSMC is a major player in the efforts to bring chip manufacturing to the U.S. That alliance is huge for shareholders, and it’s the biggest foundry globally, providing Nvidia and all the other chip titans with the AI tech that fuels current trends. That can’t be overlooked at any point.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

CFPB examiners would be able to monitor payment apps for compliance with federal money-transfer laws, as well as for unfair, deceptive, or abusive conduct, should the rule be finalized. The agency can already step in if nonbanks act unlawfully, but it can’t regularly supervise their operations under current rules.\\n\\n“Today’s rule would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in the statement.\\n\\nThe use of digital payments to store and send money — services such as PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Venmo and Block Inc.’s Cash App — has boomed in recent years as consumers use their phones and other electronic devices for transactions. While banks have largely facilitated these services in the past, technology companies have now stepped in, according to the CFPB, and safeguards that consumers tend to take for granted, including deposit insurance, may not apply.\\n\\nThe CFPB doesn’t have authority over deposit insurance, so it wouldn’t be able to enforce those types of protections even if additional oversight is approved, but the agency would be able to know if companies are making false claims.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe proposal is aimed squarely at Apple Pay and Google Pay. The CFPB already supervises PayPal and Block, so the agency likely has at least has some visibility on activity for Venmo and Cash App.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Alphabet declined to comment.

Scott Talbott, executive vice president of the Electronic Transactions Association, which represents affected companies, said the group “supports the goals of consistency and robust consumer protection” and will examine the proposed rule.\\n\\n“By bringing supervisory attention to large nonbank payment firms in line with expectations for banks offering similar products, the CFPB is taking a step in the right direction,” Lindsey Johnson, chief executive officer of the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents retail banks, said in an emailed statement. “For a healthy, innovative and competitive financial-services ecosystem to function, consumers need to know that they are protected equally, regardless of who they do business with to meet their financial needs.”\\n\\nThe CFPB estimates that 17 companies representing 88% of total digital payments annually would be covered under the proposed rule. Those companies processed some 13 billion transactions representing $1.7 trillion in payments in 2021, the agency estimates.\\n\\nThe CFPB is already investigating Venmo’s error-resolution processes, PayPal said in a Nov. 2 regulatory filing. The company said it’s cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nUnder Chopra, the CFPB has been eyeing big tech companies’ entrance into consumer payments and other financial services. Chopra’s first act as director, in October 2021, was to demand information from Apple, Google, Amazon Inc. and other big tech companies about their payment operations.\\n\\nIn September, the CFPB warned Apple over its policy of requiring iPhone users to funnel all payments through Apple Pay, instead of allowing direct integration with apps such as Venmo.

Rather than adding new features, company engineers were tasked with fixing the flaws and improving the performance of the software, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.\\n\\nApple’s software — famous for its clean interfaces, easy-to-use controls and focus on privacy — is one of its biggest selling points. That makes quality control imperative. But the company has to balance a desire to add new features with making sure its operating systems run as smoothly as possible.\\n\\nIn recent years, Apple has put more emphasis on quality — even when it’s meant delaying new capabilities. In 2018, software engineering chief Craig Federighi pushed back several unreleased iPhone features until the following year amid concerns that the software was too buggy.\\n\\nIn 2019, he overhauled the way Apple develops software in a further attempt to stave off problems. Under the approach, each feature has to be enabled manually — via a process dubbed “feature flags” — allowing employee testers to isolate the impact on the overall system before adding it.\\n\\nThat year, he also adopted what is known within Apple as “The Pact.” The agreement calls for employees to never knowingly allow “regressions” — when software that once worked stops functioning correctly — and quickly fix mistakes. Federighi’s policies have helped: Apple software releases have been less buggy in recent years, and fewer features had to be delayed.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut the latest round of development hasn’t gone as smoothly. When looking at new operating systems due for release next year, the software engineering management team found too many “escapes” — an industry term for bugs missed during internal testing. So the division took the unusual step of halting all new feature development for one week to work on fixing the bugs.\\n\\nWith thousands of different Apple employees working on a range of operating systems and devices — that need to work together seamlessly — it’s easy for glitches to crop up. “It’s a problem of 10,000 people typing code and completely breaking the operating system,” one person familiar with the situation said.\\n\\nLast month, the company completed the first version of its next iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems. That iteration is known as M1 since it’s the first major milestone. The iPhone and iPad software, which will become iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, is dubbed “Crystal” internally. The Mac software, macOS 15, is called “Glow.”\\n\\nApple delayed the start of work on the second milestone release, known as M2. The halt also applied to the next Apple Watch operating system — watchOS 11, which is dubbed “Moonstone” — as well as an update to the current iOS 17 called iOS 17.4. That software, used by the iPhone and iPad, is expected to be released around next March.\\n\\nThe move also affected future versions of visionOS, the software for Apple’s Vision Pro headset, which is due early next year. At this point, though, the development delays are unlikely to postpone the actual consumer releases. Apple is lifting the pause this week.\\n\\nApple typically launches its major software overhauls each September, after previewing them to developers and consumers at its June conference. For next year, the company is planning to focus on integrating generative AI into its products.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nElon Musk’s Brain Implant Startup Is Ready to Start Surgery In Uruguay, a Tax Haven With Lots of Beaches and Little Crime Private Equity Courts a Growing Class of Mini-Millionaires Top-Ranked MBA Programs Struggle to Reverse Declining Applications Who’s Ready for a Trump-Biden Rematch?

Our writers at InvestorPlace.com and I picked these elite stocks for their wide economic moats, innovative uses of artificial intelligence, and reasonable valuations.\\n\\nI hope you bought them. Since Monday, shares of these firms have surged on positive AI news:\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). Up 20.5% after beating Q3 expectations and noting success in AI-powered analytics applications. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Up 5% after positive news from rival Freshworks (NASDAQ:FRSH) suggests a surge of customer demand. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Up 6.4% after beating Q3 expectations and giving a strong full-year profit forecast. Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). Up 4% each after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) released positive cloud computing results last week\\n\\nOn average, these companies are up 8% in just a week – doubling the Nasdaq-100 index.\\n\\nThat’s because quality matters, in both the long and short run. The best AI-related companies have strong barriers to entry, thanks to superior products and hefty budgets dedicated to research and development. (Synopsys and Cadence operate a near-monopoly in their shared industry). That gives them a higher chance of doing well over long periods of time.\\n\\nHigh-quality companies also tend to have positive momentum, which translates into short-term gains. Palantir’s recent upswing demonstrates this truth.\\n\\nThat’s why I’m excited to reveal another three dependable AI stocks from the writers at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site. Dependable growth companies don’t come around often. And finding them when prices are ideal is even harder…\\n\\n3 AI Stocks to Buy for Dependable 2024 Gains: Alphabet (GOOG) google (GOOGL) chrome app on a smartphone screen\\n\\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nShares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) sank 11% last week after the company announced lighter-than-expected cloud computing results. Google Cloud revenues grew just 22% year over year, compared to a 29% surge at Microsoft’s Azure cloud services.\\n\\nJoel Baglole notes this week at InvestorPlace.com that the selloff was overdone, and that the drawdown is an opportunity to buy the dip:\\n\\nAlphabet says its cloud-computing revenue came in roughly $20 million lighter than Wall Street forecasts at $8.41 billion, and the stock is down 12% in two days.\\n\\nThis is a classic earnings overreaction and completely unjustified.\\n\\nIt also overlooks the fact that Alphabet reported several pieces of good news related to its cloud unit for Q3, namely that its revenue grew 22% from a year earlier, double the rate of expansion for the company as a whole. And the cloud-computing unit swung to a profit of $266 million in Q3 of this year after losing $440 million during the same period of 2022… Investors would be smart to buy the dip in this first-class tech stock.\\n\\nJoel sees the selloff as an opportunity to buy into an incredible AI franchise. Google plans to release a competing service to OpenAI’s ChatGPT later this year. A “dazzling” launch will reshape the narrative that it was blindsided by Microsoft and OpenAI, as some analysts put it. Google’s “Gemini” AI offering plans to combine text, image, and sound searches into a single generative AI product.\\n\\nAlphabet also has a relatively stable outlook, giving it a more dependable investment profile. Net revenues are expected to grow at roughly 10% annually through 2026, and operating margins should expand from the mid-26% level to almost 30%. Cloud computing will also make up a growing portion of company profits, reducing the firm’s reliance on search and advertising.\\n\\nThat last point is particularly good news for Alphabet, a company facing lawsuits for unfair practices in the search industry. These allegations have cast a long shadow over Google’s valuations; shares trade at under 20X forward earnings – roughly a third lower than rival Microsoft.\\n\\nTogether, that means Alphabet likely trades at a wide discount to fair value. It’s an innovative firm that’s been unfairly maligned by those who believe the inventor of Google Translate, Maps, and the world’s most popular search engine will never catch up with OpenAI. Doubters are likely mistaken.\\n\\n2. Meta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\\n\\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI’ll admit to having a love-hate relationship with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. On the one hand, I’ve generally seen Meta as overly dependent on a social media platform (Facebook) with limited ability to grow. Meanwhile, its splashy ventures into the metaverse and virtual reality have quietly been marginalized.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Meta continues to hire some of the best programming talent in the world. For a young college graduate, getting a job offer from Facebook is much like finding a Willy Wonka Golden Ticket. It’s an incredible training ground where innovation is encouraged and performance is rewarded. Meta also continues to attract top talent at the senior level, including Yann LeCun – one of the “godfathers” of AI – and Nick Clegg, the former U.K. deputy prime minister.\\n\\nThis week at InvestorPlace.com, Chris MacDonald writes how Meta’s positives vastly outweigh the negatives, which could turn the company into the next trillion-dollar giant. He hones in on earnings to illustrate the shift:\\n\\nMeta Platforms posted a 16% increase in Q2 net income and an 11% growth in ad revenue. With improving economic conditions, the future appears promising. Additionally, they introduced generative AI tools to enhance content creation for Instagram and Facebook advertisers.\\n\\nIn other words, Meta has begun to cut back on its metaverse and VR divisions to reallocate talent toward AI. Its Llama 2 large language model is quickly becoming the standard of academic research (thanks to being free), which is helping the tech giant lock researchers into these tools. The firm also is using AI-powered discovery to help recommend more unconnected content to users.\\n\\nThese efforts are working. Facebook monthly users have continued to rise this year, and ad impressions have surged 31%.\\n\\nShares are also still reasonably priced. Meta’s 21X forward earnings multiple is low compared to its 30% return on invested capital (ROIC) and 5% expected sales growth rate. Though the stock isn’t in bargain-bin territory (as it was in 2022), investors can still buy a highly profitable firm for perhaps 10% to 15% below its intrinsic value.\\n\\n3. Symbotic (SYM) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\\n\\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\\n\\nFinally, InvestorPlace.com’s Will Ashworth highlights Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) this week as an AI company with so much going for it.\\n\\nFor starters, it’s not an overnight sensation. It’s taken 14 years of hard work since its founding in 2008 to get where it’s at today — Q3 2023 revenue of $312 million, 17% higher than a year ago, and nearly breakeven on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis.\\n\\nOn top of this, it’s focused on two of the major secular trends in the world at the moment: artificial intelligence (AI) and logistics automation. You can’t get much more on-trend than that, and yet, it’s had this focus for more than a decade, so it’s not just trying to be the flavor of the month.\\n\\nSymbotic is a Massachusetts-based firm that specializes in automating warehouses. The company counts Walmart, Target, Albertsons, and others as customers. And the firm is growing fast thanks to improvements in artificial intelligence. Revenues this year are expected to quadruple from 2022 levels and should remain at the 50% level through 2026. Analysts expect the firm to break even as soon as next year.\\n\\nEssentially, Symbotic is a best-in-class company that,\\xa0provenly, uses AI to streamline the labor-intensive warehousing industry. The company is a leader in robotic vision and uses the technology to help run “lights-out” warehouses that require no human intervention. It’s such a powerful tool that Walmart decided in 2022 to deploy Symbotic’s robots in all 42 of its regional distribution centers.\\n\\nShares are also more reasonably priced now that the stock is down 40% since July. The company now trades at eight times estimated 2025 sales. And though shares will remain volatile because of Symbotic’s high growth rate, history tells us that it’s these types of fast-growing plays (with plenty of revenues) that eventually come out ahead.\\n\\nThe Price Is Right: AI Edition\\n\\nThere’s one major problem with investing in AI right now:\\n\\nIt looks much like the internet in the late 1990s.\\n\\nValuations of certain AI startups are through the roof. OpenAI itself is now valued at $90 billion, which would put it in the top fifth of the S&P 500 by market capitalization. And startups like Paris-based Mistral AI are gaining $2-billion-or-more price tags, despite generating no meaningful revenues or having any major customers.\\n\\nIt’s also sometimes hard to tell which companies will succeed. OpenAI itself has an untested business model, much like Amazon in 1997. And PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) began life in 1999 without charging service fees. The online payments firm would end up losing roughly 2% of payment value per transaction before abandoning that model in 2000.\\n\\nBut even the dot-com boom produced some dependable picks. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft were both profitable during that period, and they would use their financial success to fund expansion and turn ordinary investors into millionaires. And Google had been profitable since 2001 by the time it went public three years later.\\n\\nToday, finding dependable picks among AI companies is as important as ever. Many marginal firms will lose everything, cratering the portfolios that own them. Others will lose 50%… 80%… 90% before getting bought out for parts. Meanwhile, the more dependable firms will march ahead.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s important to note that Luke Lango\\xa0is saying we are now entering the second wave of the AI Revolution, where companies are racing to create complex, task-specific AI models.\\n\\nIn this race for customization, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and more are turning away from the legacy chipmakers and creating their own custom AI chips. Over the next few years, as we all turn toward custom AI, billions upon billions of dollars will flow into custom AI chipmakers and related companies.\\n\\nThis, Luke says, is the AI Revolution’s first big turning point.\\n\\nAnd in order to capitalize on this massive shift in the AI market, Luke has put together a brand-new portfolio of seven stocks that are poised to benefit as we shift into Phase 2 of the AI Revolution.\\n\\nClick here for details.\\n\\nAs of this writing, Tom Yeung\\xa0held a LONG position in GOOG and GOOGL.

Alongside the paying out of dividends, share buybacks are a great vehicle for mature businesses to maximize value for investors.\\n\\nMostly, because share buybacks, also known as share repurchases, decreases the number of outstanding shares. This helps to give an upward lift to earnings per share, in turn helping to increase returns for investors.\\n\\nThe usage of share repurchases varies from company-to-company. Some blue chips prefer to focus their return-of-capital efforts on just dividends, reinvesting the remainder of free cash flow back into efforts to grow their respective businesses, such as organic growth and/or strategic acquisitions.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nOther companies, however, devote a big allocation of free cash to share repurchase programs. That’s the situation here, with the following seven blue-chip stocks with share buyback programs.\\n\\nEach one is in the process of repurchasing at least $1 billion worth of its own stock.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on building\\n\\nSource: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), trillion dollar club member and “Magnificent Seven” component, may be best known as a growth stock, but in one regard, the tech powerhouse acts more like a mature, blue-chip sort of company: return of capital efforts.\\n\\nWhen it comes to dividends, AAPL stock is far from a high-yielder. Shares currently have a forward dividend yield of 0.54%. However, in stock buybacks, the company has been quite active over the past decade. According to Yahoo! Finance, the iPhone maker has bought back more than $573 billion worth of stock since 2012.\\n\\nTwo years in a row, Apple’s board has given authorization to the company to repurchase $90 billion of its own shares. Alongside the growth of its underlying business, Apple’s aggressive repurchase program has undoubtedly played a big role in sending the stock up by more than ninefold over the past eleven years.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) may at first glance not seem like a blue-chip stock. To some extent, this makes sense. Although established and profitable, the customer relationship management software provider is a relatively young company, not a century-old business as are most blue-chips.\\n\\nThat said, CRM stock, much like AAPL stock, is a Dow Jones Industrial Average component. While a “new school” company, inclusion in this “old school” index gives credence to the argument that Salesforce is among the tech blue chips.\\n\\nYet while CRM’s blue-chip status is up for debate, there’s no denying that if it is, it’s one of the blue-chip stocks with share buyback programs.\\n\\nIn fact, Salesforce has become quite aggressive when it comes to repurchase efforts. In 2022, under pressure from activist investors, CRM’s board authorized a $10 billion buyback, and this year the company announced plans to repurchase $20 billion worth of shares.\\n\\nChevron (CVX) CVX stock\\n\\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThere’s no question about Chevron’s (NYSE:CVX) blue-chip status. The integrated oil and gas company, whose origins stem from the Standard Oil trust broken up more than 100 years ago, is as blue-chip as you can get.\\n\\nThe latest headlines with CVX stock have had to do with the big oil firm’s big acquisition announcement: its plans to acquire oil and gas exploration/production company Hess (NYSE:HES), in a $53 billion all-stock deal.\\n\\nYet while Chevron has a massive transaction on its plate, don’t assume that management is putting the brakes on share repurchases.\\n\\nInstead, once the deal (expected to be accretive to cash flow per share) closes, Chevron intends to slightly increase its repurchase target, from $17.5 billion to $20 billion per year. In terms of dividends, the company is now proposing an 8% increase to its quarterly payout, effective this upcoming January.\\n\\nHP (HPQ)\\n\\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAdmittedly, “former blue-chip” may be a more accurate descriptor for HP (NYSE:HPQ). Yet while removed from the Dow a decade ago, and continuing to struggle with growing its business during this time, the PC and printer company’s shares have gained by 132.8% since 2013.\\n\\nA big reason for this is likely the fact HPQ stock has been one of the blue-chips with share buyback programs, aggressively buying back shares over the past few years. HPQ buybacks totaled $6.2 billion in FY2021 (ending October 2021), and $4.3 billion in FY2022.\\n\\nWhile easing on buybacks during FY2023, HP plans to tap into this strategy again this fiscal year. The company intends to use all of its free cash flow for return of capital efforts. Based on the planned level of dividend payouts, this implies at least $2 billion in buybacks between now and next October.\\n\\nLowes (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\\n\\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIn past coverage of Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), I’ve argued why shares in this home improvement retailer are one of the best among the blue-chips. A big reason, of course, is the stock’s dividend aristocrat status.\\n\\nYet alongside this, another big reason to be bullish about LOW is the company’s share repurchase policy.\\n\\nLate last year, management announced that the retailer intended to increase its existing buyback program (authorizing the repurchase of up to $6.4 billion in LOW stock) by another $15 billion. Lowes has bought back around $4.15 billion worth of shares during the first half of 2023, and could buy billions more in the coming quarters.\\n\\nEven if the underlying business experiences a low level of growth over the next few years, these buybacks stand to boost Lowes’ earnings. The latest sell-side forecasts call for earnings to climb higher over the next few fiscal years.\\n\\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco bay\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIn August, I laid out the bear case for United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). In a nutshell, I argued that achieving labor peace with the Teamsters Union representing the transportation giant’s workers may have a negative impact on future earnings.\\n\\nHowever, there may be a way for management to counter the impact of higher labor costs on the performance of UPS stock going forward: share repurchases.\\n\\nUnions may bemoan buybacks, but being one of the blue-chip stocks with share buyback programs may be only way UPS’s shareholders can also “win,” following labor’s recent victory at the company.\\n\\nFor 2023, UPS is targeting around $3 billion in share repurchases. By repurchasing shares and reducing the share count, UPS could improve earnings performance and drive a recovery in its stock, which has been negatively affected by labor and recession worries.\\n\\nExxon Mobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time\\n\\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nJust like Chevron, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another Standard Oil descendant with a penchant for share repurchases. Last December, the integrated oil and gas giant raised its share buyback program ceiling from $30 billion to $50 billion, and extended it through 2024.\\n\\nAlso similar to CVX, a big topic with XOM stock lately has the announcement of a mega-merger. As you likely heard, the company intends to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) in a $59.5 billion all-stock deal. Both of these things could bode well for Exxon shareholders.\\n\\nBuybacks, coupled with cost-saving measures, are good news for future increases with earnings per share. The Pioneer transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings, with additional cost and growth synergies expected to arise. Add in XOM’s 3.53% dividend, and the stock may be poised to deliver solid total returns in the years ahead.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel\\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\\xa0Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

He steered investors to roughly 3.7 million percent returns since becoming chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) in 1965. That’s a 20% compound annual growth rate or twice the returns of the S&P 500.\\n\\nYet Buffett’s secret to success is his partner Charlie Munger. He joined Berkshire in the mid-1970s and became vice chairman in 1978. Together they have been an investment powerhouse. Buffett wrote shareholders earlier this year stating, “Charlie and I think pretty much alike,” so his advice was, “Find a very smart high-grade partner — preferably slightly older than you — and then listen very carefully to what he says.”\\n\\nSo you might expect Berkshire Hathaway to avoid artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Munger is suspicious of the technology. He told the Zoomtopia conference last month, “I think it’s getting a huge amount of hype. And I think it’s probably getting more than it deserves.” And he told Berkshire shareholders, “I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence. I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well.”\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nYet Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio is chock full of AI stocks. Many companies utilize AI in some fashion. For example, American Express (NYSE:AXP) uses machine learning and AI to weed out credit card fraud and automate fraud risk decisions. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) uses AI to develop marketing campaigns. Looking at that way, almost any company can be seen as an “AI stock.”\\n\\nRather, the following three stocks are deep into AI development. They account for $164 billion of value in Berkshire Hathaway’s $343 billion total portfolio. Likely, they weren’t bought because they were AI stocks, but you may want to invest alongside Buffett and Munger in them anyway.\\n\\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\\n\\nOne of Buffett’s biggest direct investments in AI is Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW). The cloud-based analytics software firm is on a spending spree to bring advanced AI and deep learning to the data cloud. Recently, it acquired search company Neeva and open-source app platform Streamlit. It also announced plans to acquire data sorting software maker Applica.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSnowflake also developed Cortex for users to access and use generative AI to quickly analyze data and build their own AI applications. Through specialized machine learning and large language models, users can now access serverless functions to accelerate their everyday analytics in one location. It’s in private preview mode at the moment but is expected to be made widely available later.\\n\\nThe data analytics company is hot. Revenue grew 37% in the second quarter to $640 million. Snowflake guided for full-year product revenue to finish at $2.6 billion, up 34% from 2022. Yet it also had some $3.5 billion in remaining performance obligations, which represent the amount of contracted future revenue Snowflake hasn’t recognized yet.\\n\\nSnowflake’s stock is down 22% from recent highs and is up 11% so far this year. The S&P 500 is up 13.5%. The growth trajectory it is on makes getting into this stock now a good opportunity. Buffett has almost $1 billion invested in this data cloud stock or some 0.3% of Berkshire’s total.\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\\n\\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\\n\\nBuffett and Munger probably bought Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) because of its enormous e-commerce footprint and Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AI is now part of the company’s very fabric and is being used across all of its services.\\n\\nConsumers on the website see shopping recommendations powered by Amazon’s AI suggestion tool. Amazon also uses it to spot trends for future product development. Its warehouses are filled with robots picking, sorting and collating orders. The robotics leverage computer vision and AI to recognize and handle millions of items annually.\\n\\nAWS also widely deploys a comprehensive set of AI services, tools and resources for client use. CEO Andy Jassy told analysts that diverse multinational corporations like Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were using AWS to power their generative AI apps. Amazon also just launched an AI-image generator tool for advertisers. Its Bedrock platform lets customers create conversational agents to deliver personalized experiences based on proprietary data. It can then execute actions resulting from its knowledge base.\\n\\nThe Buffett-Munger dynamic duo owns $1.4 billion worth of Amazon stock, representing 0.4% of Berkshire’s total. The stock previously fell due to Amazon’s data abuse concerns, but the earnings report boosted shares, sending them soaring. The stock is up 9% over the past month, but may still be a bargain.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\\n\\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBuffett’s love affair with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) doesn’t require an introduction. He owns so much of Apple stock it comprises 48% of the total, some $177.6 billion worth. Apple is very much an AI stock even if Buffett bought shares because of its dominating consumer-facing tech gadgets.\\n\\nSiri may be one of Apple’s most visible AI components. Yet CEO Tim Cook told analysts he views “AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and [SIC] integral to virtually every product that we ship.”\\n\\nCook pointed to Personal Voice, designed to create an automated voice that sounds like you, and Live Voicemail, which displays a live transcription of a voicemail as it’s being recorded in real-time. He also noted the Apple Watch incorporates fall detection, crash detection and electrocardiograms. “These would not be possible without AI,” he said.\\n\\nGenerative AI is becoming deeply enmeshed in Apple’s consumer technology. The Information reported that Apple was spending “millions of dollars a day” to develop new features.\\n\\nApple’s A17 Pro chip for the iPhone is one of the biggest developments. Apple says it’s the “fastest mobile CPU.” The chip has six CPU cores that can handle the taxing power required by AI. It can handle up to 35 trillion operations per second. It can process machine learning and AI tasks without connecting to the cloud via an external data center. That provides users with an incredibly fast and positive experience.\\n\\nApple is still a tech titan to be reckoned with. Despite China sales slowing and a warning of flat holiday sales, any weakness in the stock gives investors the chance to get into the company Buffett loves so much.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in KO stock.

Although it used to be\\xa0a darling of the payments space, PayPal’s\\xa0fortunes\\xa0changed dramatically over the\\xa0last two years. With Apple getting deeper into the payments space, PayPal got threatened. The rise of Apple Pay has certainly cast a shadow over PayPal’s growth.

Photo and video editors who needed that extra oomph to tackle all of their graphics needs, turned to the MacBook Pro for years as their laptop of choice. But Apple is increasingly marketing its Pro line to a broader set of consumers ranging from everyday users to small business owners and gamers.\\n\\nThe latest versions of the MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch are easily the best the company has produced to-date. Equipped with Apple’s new M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max chips, the laptops are sleek, powerful, and capable.\\n\\nBut they’re also expensive. The base Pro starts at $1,599. The average consumer can likely stick to the MacBook Air with Apple’s M2 chip for $1,099. My wife and I just bought one ourselves a few weeks back.\\n\\nBut, if you’re in the market for the best portable power Apple has to offer, the MacBook Pro is easily the way to go.\\n\\nNew color, same look\\n\\nApple has kept the latest MacBook Pro 14-inch and MacBook Pro 16-inch relatively unchanged versus the prior generation of both models. You get the same number of connectors—3 Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a full-size HDMI connection, an SD card slot, headphone jack, and MagSafe port—and the same 1080p webcam and 6-speaker setup. Apple's latest MacBook Pro is incredibly powerful, but comes with a hefty price tag. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\\n\\nYou’d be hard pressed to spot any differences between Apple’s latest Pros and the 14-inch and 16-inch versions Apple introduced back in January. There is, however, one difference. If you opt for a 14-inch or 16-inch Pro with an M3 Pro or M3 Max, you can choose Apple’s new Space Black color scheme. The company says the Macbook has an anodization seal that keeps handprints from sticking to the aluminum.\\n\\nIt’s a nice addition to the package, and it works incredibly well. My MacBook Air regularly picks up fingerprints, but the Pro doesn’t. It’s a small thing, not at all something that will make or break your decision to purchase the Pro.\\n\\nTons of power\\n\\nThe review unit I’ve been using is a MacBook Pro 14-inch with an M3 Max chip, 64GB of unified memory, and 2TB of storage. But this isn’t the standard version of the M3 Max. The one in this Mac is a stepped up model. Rather than the 14-core CPU and 30-core GPU in the normal M3 Max, the version in the review unit has a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU. It’s the very top of the line chip Apple currently offers, and it’s an absolute beast. It also costs $4,299.\\n\\nStory continues Apple's latest MacBook Pros get the company's new M3 line of chips. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\\n\\nI ran the game “Baldur’s Gate 3” while also downloading the game “Lies of P,” listening to Spotify, had the Edge browser open, and running the Cinebench 2024 GPU benchmark test, and the MacBook Pro still managed to handle itself without much issue. Yes, “Baldur’s Gate 3” slowed down here and there, but the fact that it could play it at all with so much going on in the background was impressive in and of itself.\\n\\nWithout all of the extra nonsense going on, the game ran like a dream. “Lies of P” ran equally well, buttery smooth, without any hiccups. It’s impressive to see Apple diving deeper into gaming, and could serve as a means of expanding its market share and further growing the Mac brand.\\n\\nApple hasn’t traditionally had much luck in gaming outside of mobile games on the iPhone and iPad, but with the latest Macs it’s clearly making a run at the segment. And with the kind of performance I saw from the MacBook Pro 14-inch, it can easily handle some of the biggest games out there.\\n\\nThe company, however, will need to get more game developers and publishers behind its efforts if it hopes to become a gaming juggernaut like Microsoft’s Windows. It’ll also need to ensure that users won’t need to spend as much as this particular MacBook Pro costs to get a quality experience. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\\n\\nOutside of gaming, the MacBook Pro 14-inch proved incredibly capable when doing everything from browsing the web to listening to music to streaming video. And for a system with a ton of power, the computer’s fans only spun up when I was gaming or running some other kind of benchmark test.\\n\\nAs for battery life, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is a champ. It’ll easily last you throughout your workday and then some. I only noticed significant battery drain while gaming and outputting to a separate monitor.\\n\\nShould you get it?\\n\\nOverall, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is a beastly machine in a compact package. The particular model I tested, however, isn’t going to be for everyone. It’s more meant for people who want huge amounts of power for video editing, CAD modeling, working with AI software, or high-end gaming.\\n\\nThe average person can certainly get away with the entry-level $1,599 MacBook Pro, which features an M3 chip, 8GB of memory, and 512GB of storage. I do wish Apple added more memory to the model though.\\n\\nStill, when it comes to Pro laptops, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is an exceptional piece of technology.

(AAPL) a Buy Now?', 'content': \"Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\\n\\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 2.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\\n\\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\\n\\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\\n\\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\\n\\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, indicating a change of +7.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.\\n\\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.05 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1%. This estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.49 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.\\n\\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\\n\\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\\n\\n12 Month EPS\\n\\nProjected Revenue Growth\\n\\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\\n\\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $89.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $382.82 billion and $400.5 billion estimates indicate -0.1% and +4.6% changes, respectively.\\n\\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\\n\\nApple reported revenues of $81.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $1.20 a year ago.\\n\\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.54%. The EPS surprise was +5.88%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\\n\\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\\n\\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\\n\\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a meaningful detractor to relative performance in recent quarters as the company has seen moderate earnings growth but substantial P/E multiple expansion. In our view, Apple is a great business but one with more risk factors related to China than we would prefer: relatively low EPS growth, which is being heavily aided by share buybacks (slower EPS growth than every single company in our Portfolio); and a high P/E ratio for this level of growth. This combination rarely leads to excellent long-term share price performance in our experience.\\n\\nLast quarter, Apple’s new iPhone introduction failed to generate much excitement, with iPhone units declining year over year. There was also news that the Chinese government was blocking its employees from using iPhones. Apple is exposed to the rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. The latter is responsible for much of the company’s incremental iPhone growth, and nearly all of Apple’s supply chain is China-based. The relatively small action by the Chinese government was a reminder to investors that Apple is not immune from geopolitics or other risks.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\\n\\nApple Inc.

The pace of sales growth globally has also moderated to “the lower end of their pre-pandemic ranges,” Deutsche Bank Group AG strategists said.\\n\\nThat’s overshadowed a surprise increase in quarterly earnings so far, with investors instead focusing on a long list of revenue warnings from the likes of Apple Inc. and Estée Lauder Cos. In Europe, too, the season has been characterized by high-profile cuts including from Remy Cointreau SA.\\n\\n“We heard a lot of caution in managements’ guidance during the season and that’s exactly what we are watching for — weaker sales and margins compression as pricing power wanes,” said Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. “For now, consumer and corporates still have access to credit, but it’s getting harder and more expensive.

This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Nvidia NVDA.\\n\\nQ3 Results Reflect Positivity, but Outlook Uncertain\\n\\nWith Q3 results from more than 80% of S&P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that actual results have once again turned out to be better than expected. Keep in mind that Q3 earnings estimates had barely budged ahead of the start of the reporting cycle, which makes the outperformance all the more significant.\\n\\nWe continue to be of the view that while the overall earnings picture isn’t great, it isn’t falling off the cliff either. In fact, Q3 earnings growth is on track to turn positive, which follows three back-to-back quarters of declines.\\n\\nOn the negative side, the Q3 results show a notable loss of momentum on the revenues side, both in terms of the growth rate as well as the proportion of these companies beating top-line expectations.\\n\\nAn even more disconcerting development is on the revisions front, with estimates for the current (2023 Q4) and coming quarters starting to come down, which follows a relatively stable revisions trend over the preceding six months.\\n\\nHere are the four notable features of the Q3 earnings season:\\n\\nFirst, earnings growth is on track to turn positive. Q3 earnings for the 405 S&P 500 companies that have reported already are up +0.4% from the same period (up +5.6% excluding the Energy sector drag).\\n\\nFor the quarter as a whole, combining the actuals for these 405 companies with estimates for the still-to-come 95 index members, Q3 earnings are on track to increase by +1.5% on an equivalent growth in revenues.\\n\\nThe positive Q3 earnings growth follows three quarters of declines, with the growth pace expected to improve steadily in the coming quarters.\\n\\nSecond, fewer companies have been able to beat Q3 revenue estimates. For the 405 S&P 500 members that have reported Q3 results, 82.5% are beating EPS estimates, and 61.5% are beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs you can see above, the Q3 EPS beats percentage is tracking above the 5-year average (preceding 20 quarters), but the revenue beats percentage is notably weaker. In fact, the 61.5% beats percentage for these 405 S&P 500 members is the lowest since the first quarter of 2020 when Covid got underway.\\n\\nIn terms of revenue growth, the Q3 top-line growth rate of +1.6% for this group of 405 index members that have reported is modestly better than what we had seen in the preceding period, but otherwise representative of a steadily decelerating trend.\\n\\nThird, the Tech sector has resumed its growth trajectory. We still have a number of Tech sector companies that have yet to report Q3 results. But Q3 earnings for the 73.3% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have already reported results are up +15.8% on +2.7% higher revenues.\\n\\nFor the quarter as a whole, combining the actuals that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come Tech companies, Q3 earnings are on track to increase +20.8% on +4.2% higher revenues.\\n\\nThe Tech sector’s growth profile has been going through a post-COVID adjustment phase since the fourth quarter of 2021, with a low single-digit earnings growth rate in the preceding period (2023 Q2) appearing after four quarters of declines.\\n\\nAs you can see in the chart above, the sector is expected to resume its historical role as a growth driver going forward.\\n\\nThe Tech sector’s renewed growth trajectory is particularly notable when we look at the earnings picture for the mega-cap Tech players, what we refer to as the ‘Big 7 Tech players’ that includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and others.\\n\\nThe market wasn’t impressed with Apple’s results, whose Q3 earnings were up +10.8% on essentially flat revenues (down -0.7%). But more than Apple’s Q3 results, investors didn’t like the company’s underwhelming guidance for the December quarter.\\n\\nQ3 earnings for the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ increased +51% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with the group’s growth picture expected to remain strong in the coming periods as well.\\n\\nFourth, estimates for the current and coming quarters have started coming down in a significant way over the last few weeks.\\n\\nThe expectation currently is for 2023 Q4 earnings to be up +1.9% from the same period last year on +2.7% higher revenues. This growth pace represents a notable decline from what was expected for the period in late September of +5.3% earnings growth on +3.6% higher revenues.\\n\\nThe cuts to Q4 earnings estimates are widespread, with estimates getting cut for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. The sectors suffering the biggest cuts include Autos, Medical, Transportation, and Consumer Discretionary.\\n\\nOn the positive side, estimates have increased for the Energy, Utilities, Industrials, and Retail sectors.\\n\\nEstimates for the Tech sector have modestly gone up, a significant deceleration from the pace of positive estimate revisions that we saw in the last two quarters.\\n\\nThe Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard & This Week’s Docket\\n\\nIncluding all the earnings reports through Friday, November 3rd, we now have Q3 results from 405 S&P 500 members, or 81% of the index’s total membership. Total Q3 earnings for these companies are up +0.4% from the same period last year on +1.6% higher revenues, with 92.5% beating EPS estimates and 61.5% beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nWe have another super busy reporting docket this week with more than 1200 companies reporting Q3 results, including 52 S&P 500 members. The notable companies reporting results this week include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Berkshire Hathaway, and others.\\n\\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Growth Turns Positive\\n\\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks\\' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P\\'s +6.2 average gain per year.

Even so, Epic maintains that Google still maintains a stranglehold on the Android app ecosystem and the payment system attached to it — and has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to stifle competition.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMuch like Apple did in its trial, Google defends its commissions as a way to be compensated for all money that it invests into its Play Store and asserts that the controls over it are a way to protect the security of the tens of millions of people in the U.S. who download apps for phones powered by Android.\\n\\nGoogle initially was going to have to defend itself against multiple foes in the trial, but in September it settled allegations that had been brought against the Play Store by state attorneys general and just last week resolved a case being pursued by Match Group, the owner of Tinder and other online dating services.\\n\\nThe Match settlement prompted Google to switch from its original request for a jury trial to a proceeding to be decided by the judge, but Donato rebuffed the bid.\\n\\nMatch is receiving $40 million and adopting Google\\'s “user choice billing\" system in its settlement. The terms of the resolution with the state attorneys general is expected to be revealed during Google\\'s trial with Epic.\\n\\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney skewered the “user choice billing” option as a sham in a social media post vowing to fight Google in court. Sweeney also is expected to take the witness stand during the trial.\\n\\nWilson White, Google\\'s vice president of government affairs and public policy, accused Epic of trying to get “something for nothing” in a blog post. After pointing out that Epic already lost the crux of its case against Apple, White blasted the game maker for “trying their luck with Android by bringing a case that has even less merit.”', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-antitrust-headaches-compound-another-003922320.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.923, 'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.063}}, {'date': '2023-11-06T00:24:00+00:00', 'title': \"Warren Buffett stockpiles cash waiting for a deal as investors wonder where he'll put his money next\", 'content': \"Berkshire Hathaway reports a cash horde of some $157 billion leaving many to wonder where CEO Warren Buffett will invest next.

From Apple’s muted holiday outlook to Google parent Alphabet’s lackluster cloud computing sales results, a recurring theme for the cohort was caution. Meta warned that the year ahead is looking less predictable, while Tesla raised concerns that demand for electric cars is starting to weaken.\\n\\nThat’s stirring angst for investors even as the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index rallied last week, rising 6.5% and clocking in its best week in a year.\\n\\n“This is all about failure of future guidance,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive at Advisors Asset Management. “Big tech stocks were priced to historic perfection, so that left investors disappointed after those companies came up short.”\\n\\nTech stocks are now on shaky ground. The seven biggest tech stocks are down an average of about 9% from 52-week highs. Apple alone has lost more than $300 billion in market value.\\n\\nThe selloff has made valuations cheaper, but they’re still pricey and with future expansion less certain, investors are balking at paying up for the stocks.

That’s nearly twice the multiple of the other 493 stocks in the benchmark.\\n\\nProfits for the seven biggest so-called growth companies in the S&P 500 — Apple, Microsoft Corp., Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Meta and Tesla — are on course to rise 50%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Despite Tesla missing earnings, the group is poised to surpass the 36% increase estimates called for before earnings season began. Nvidia is the last to report on Nov. 21.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTo Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, the pressure on Big Tech is a sign that the correction in the S&P 500 is close to running its course, setting the stage for outperformance in the last two months of the year, which tend to be a good time for stocks.\\n\\n“We are in a better seasonal period for the market, rates stabilizing, mixed economic data and upbeat news on AI,” he said. “With many investors underperforming, partly because of missing out on tech earlier this year, we think we could see some investors chasing tech into year-end on the fear of being left behind.”\\n\\nOf course, the tech sector in the S&P 500 still carries a nearly 36% premium to the index on a forward price-to-earnings basis, per data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\\n\\nThat’s why Colyer says he still sees more pain ahead for bigger growth stocks that may have gotten ahead of themselves. His firm, Advisors Asset Management, has opted to own Microsoft shares on bets that the company’s big artificial intelligence investment is paying off.\\n\\n“There’s a lot of AI hype, but not every company is market ready,” he added. “Stocks may rally into the end of the year, but I wouldn’t say this is an all-clear for tech shares or even the broader market.”\\n\\nAfter the S&P 500 logged three straight monthly declines, the gauge notched its best week of 2023 after the Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday that a run-up in long-term Treasury yields will reduce the impetus to raise interest rates again.\\n\\nStill, the battle between tech stocks and bond yields may continue in the weeks ahead, which may potentially hurt money managers who’ve just plunged back into US megacap companies as yields fell.\\n\\n“Everything can change in a heartbeat if there is economic or geopolitical upheaval, which would directly impact stocks broadly that aren’t discounting the inherent dangers of a concentrated market in technology companies,” said Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. “So be cautious and don’t get too optimistic on megacap tech.”\\n\\n--With assistance from Tom Contiliano.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess These Five Countries Are Key Economic ‘Connectors’ in a Fragmenting World Online Gambling Has Millions of Young Africans Battling Addiction World’s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-growth-status-doubt-150000813.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'FB2A.F', 'FB2A.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'TL0.F', 'TL0.XETRA', 'TSLA.MX'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.988, 'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.111}}, {'date': '2023-11-05T13:23:49+00:00', 'title': 'Top Small-Cap Picks: 3 Unstoppable Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy in November', 'content': 'Over time, small-cap stocks far outperform their larger cousins. The two-decade period between 1999 and 2020 saw the Russell 2000 small-cap index more than triple in value compared to a 120% return by the S&P 500. Not even the tech-charged Nasdaq 100 came close to catching the performance of these small-cap stock picks. That’s why they need to be a part of your portfolio.\\n\\nFor shorter periods, small caps can lag. During the last one-, three-, and five-year time frames, the Russell 2000 was dead last in performance. But that just means the little guys are being offered at a bigger discount than their mid- and large-cap brethren.\\n\\nAlthough the sector is going through a rough patch now, the following three small-cap stock picks offer incomparable value for November. For patient investors, these tiny acorns can grow into mighty oaks.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nDigitalOcean (DOCN) A laptop screen displays the logo for DigitalOcean (DOCN).\\n\\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhat better way to benefit from the long-term growth potential of small-cap stocks than to invest in a small-cap business catering to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)? DigitalOcean (NASDAQ:DOCN) simplifies the move to cloud computing for startups and SMBs. It makes the cloud accessible for companies that haven’t attained the size to afford the services of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\\n\\nDigitalOcean says its platform lets a business go “from inquiry to deployment within minutes, without any specialized training or heavy implementation.” That’s perfect for companies who don’t have large IT departments or any IT department at all. They just want to get it done and have it work. Yet DigitalOcean’s services can grow as the customer scales up in size. More tools can be added to their toolkit as more services are needed.\\n\\nRevenue is up 28% year to date, but expect that to grow significantly greater in the future. DigitalOcean recently acquired PaperSpace, an artificial intelligence (AI) cloud provider, that brought 500,000 customers with it. Coupled with DigitalOcean’s own 616,000 clients, the opportunity to offer enhanced services just multiplied exponentially.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNet dollar retention rate, or the amount of new money existing customers spend with it each year, was growing rapidly but shrunk from 112% last year to 104% this year. That’s due to SMBs feeling the pinch of high interest rates more acutely than larger companies do. They had to rein in spending, although they are still spending more. Even so, DigitalOcean’s stock is down 61% from recent highs.\\n\\nHowever, at 12 times earnings estimates and 16 times free cash flow, DigitalOcean is attractively valued for long-term wealth generation.\\n\\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) A close-up shot of a marijuana growhouse. cannabis trends. Small-Cap Stock Picks\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nMedical marijuana real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) is the next unstoppable Russell 2000 stock to consider. Leasing facilities to marijuana growers is just as lucrative a business in the pot industry as it is in commercial real estate and elsewhere. Although interest rates are hitting marijuana stocks hard, too, the company has strong foundations that won’t be rattled by short-term events.\\n\\nThe REIT owns 108 properties across 19 states with approximately 8.9 million rentable square feet. What makes Innovative Industrial so stable is it operates under long-term, triple-net leases exceeding 15 years. That means tenants, not the REIT, pay the taxes, maintenance and insurance on the properties. IIP just manages its portfolio and enjoys a reliable, consistent stream of rental income. That reduces operational risks for investors.\\n\\nIn just-released third-quarter earnings, revenue grew 10% from last year to $77.8 million, resulting in a similar profit increase. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) were 7.5% higher. AFFO is similar to free cash flow for REITs.\\n\\nLike all REITs, IIP is required to pay out most of its profits as dividends. The payout currently yields 10% annually. It has raised the dividend consistently since going public in 2016, growing it at a 42% annual rate. Yet the stock is taking it on the chin this year. Shares are down 28% in 2023. With the long-term trend for marijuana up, however, Innovative Industrial Properties stands to benefit from future legalization efforts.\\n\\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\\n\\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\\n\\nUnlike the previous two small-cap stock picks, Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is doing quite well. Shares more than doubled in value over the first 10 months of 2023 despite pulling back 17% from recent highs. Who knew learning a new language could be so financially rewarding?\\n\\nDuolingo language learning app is available on Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android platforms. It uses a freemium business model where users can access the app free for basic learning tools but must pay for more advanced educational applications. Although most users use the free service, Duolingo has 5.2 million paid subscribers globally, up 59% year over year. That’s 7.4% of its total 74.1 million monthly active users, giving it massive growth potential as it may be able to convert free users to paid through AI.\\n\\nEarlier this year the language specialist launched Duolingo Max, which gives subscribers access to AI tools like Roleplay. Utilizing OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, it creates an interactive tool to simulate conversations in other languages. That greatly enhances the value of the language app because a person learns best how to speak by actually conversing.\\n\\nNow Duolingo’s stock isn’t the same bargain it was a year ago after its run-up. Yet the company only went public two years ago and began trading at $140.25 a share. That means the stock is available for only 13.6% more than what you could have bought it for back then.\\n\\nAnalysts expect the global language learning market to grow at a compound growth rate of 20% annually to $337.2 billion by 2032. Duolingo should capture a large share of that market opportunity.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our introduction to the stock market and the different kinds of stocks that can be traded, then read 5 Best Large Cap Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\nStocks can be divided and segregated by several different criteria. One approach is to sort them through industries, which allows one to tailor an investment approach to the broader economic climate as well as regulatory and governmental incentives that might prove to be catalysts for sectors such as electric vehicles.\\n\\nAnother common approach in classifying stocks is using their market capitalization. The market capitalization of a company is its value calculated after multiplying its total shares outstanding with its current share price. It provides an easy way to gauge the value of a company in the eyes of investors as well as its financial heft demonstrated by the balance sheet. Within the stock market, stocks are classified as micro cap stocks, small cap stocks, large cap stocks, and mega cap stocks. Large cap stocks belong to companies whose market capitalization ranges between $10 billion and $200 billion, and the large cap classification is the final rung on the latter that a firm has to climb before it can be classified as a lucrative mega cap stock.\\n\\nWhile few analysts would advise anyone to invest in a stock based truly on its market capitalization, each category of these classifications has its own benefits and drawbacks. For large cap stocks, the potential to make a high percentage return is greater than a mega cap stock, and at the same time, the relative stability of these companies and their higher share prices when compared to small caps also provide a buffer against losses due to adverse business or economic conditions as well as market manipulation and scams.\\n\\nData compiled by Stock Analysis shows that as of early November 2023, there are 704 large cap stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. Cumulatively, these have a market capitalization of $29 trillion and total revenue of $16.36 trillion. Compare this to the statistics for small cap stocks and you might be stunned by the difference. This is because the next lower rung on our stock classification ladder, small cap stocks, has a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion and combined revenue of $1.6 trillion. In short, large cap companies have ten times the revenue of small cap companies, and more than twenty times the market capitalization. But what about mega cap stocks? Well, this list of firms made up of big ticket technology names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have a combined market capitalization of $21.16 trillion and total revenue of $5.9 trillion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLooking at this data, it's clear that when lumped together, the large cap segment is the most lucrative on the stock market in terms of both revenue and market capitalization. This is unsurprising really since when compared to the 704 large cap stocks being traded on U.S. stock markets, a rather handful of 37 stocks are classified as mega cap stocks. This lends an average mega cap company $159 billion in revenue while the figure for an average large cap stock is $23.23 billion.\\n\\nSo, what are these large cap companies, and which of these dominate the market capitalization pie? Well, one of the most valuable large cap companies in the world, and one whose market capitalization is on the cusp of making it a mega cap stock is the British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). It has $198 billion in market capitalization, and an average share price rating of Strong Buy according to data compiled by Yahoo Finance. Analysts have also priced in a 31% share price upside to the stock. In terms of its products, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) has had an active latter half of 2023. One of its biggest announcements came in late October 2023 when it announced that its lung cancer drug performed better than a standard treatment in a Phase 3 trial. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is also slated to release its earnings report soon, and analysts have set an EPS forecast of 79 cents for the firm.\\n\\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best large cap stocks to buy, and some notable names are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). 12 Best Large Cap Stocks To Buy Now\\n\\nPixabay/Public Domain\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo compile our list of the best large cap stocks to buy we first compiled the 40 most valuable large cap companies.

And they were still up about 5% for the week to $176.65.\\n\\nAMD flies on AI optimism\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soared nearly 10% Wednesday on the company\\'s cheery AI chip sales forecast, which came in addition to above-par Q3 results.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor Q3, adjusted EPS came to $0.70, two pennies above consensus, on revenue of $5.80B against the $5.7B target.\\n\\nOn the earnings call, the company predicted a weaker-than-expected current quarter - $6.1B vs. the $6.4B estimate - but CEO Lisa Su also said the company expects AI GPU sales to top $2B in 2024, allaying investor fears.\\n\\n\"This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history,\" Su said to analysts on the call.\\n\\nStill, HSBC described the company\\'s Q4 outlook as \"muted\" and said it is bullish on the MI300, but that it \"will not be sufficient to offset potential downside in overall non-AI severs, embedded, and gaming, resulting in neutral risk-reward.\"\\n\\nBofA reaffirmed a Neutral rating on the belief that AMD\\'s share price reflected AI opportunity, with the analysts lauding \"management execution\" and \"solid start to generative AI inference,\" among other things, but noting that AI sales should be \"largely offset\" by declines in the embedded and gaming segments.\\n\\nAll told, the stock gained 16.4% for the week to $112.25.\\n\\nQualcomm surpasses targets\\n\\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) climbed higher after coming in ahead both on fiscal Q4 earnings and Q1 guidance, announcing a $2.02-per-share profit on $8.67B in sales vs. Wall Street\\'s expectations for $1.91 on $8.51B.\\n\\nThe company also sees Q1 EPS at $2.25 to $2.45, nicely above the $2.22 analyst target, and sales should be in line at $9.1B to $9.9B.\\n\\nDespite positive results, Oppenheimer analysts said they remains on the sidelines as they await \"auto/PC/IoT diversification efforts\" to prove out.\\n\\nBernstein, meanwhile, raised the price target by $10 to $145 per share. The analysts cited \"$10+ in earnings power credibly on the table,\" saying the stock \"just feels too cheap to us, especially in a bottoming scenario.\"\\n\\nShares gained nearly 6% in the next session, and jumped some 12% for the week to $119.52.\\n\\nPayPal ups forecast\\n\\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) bumped 6.6% higher after the company said it earned $1.30 per share in Q3, surpassing targets by $0.07, and that it raked in $7.42B in revenue, also topping estimates.\\n\\nWhile Q4 EPS guidance was lower than anticipated at $1.36, the company also raised its full-year guide by $0.03 to $4.98, bringing it comfortably above the $4.92 consensus.\\n\\nThe company also named Jamie Miller as CFO, just three months after appointing Alex Chriss as its new CEO\\n\\nOppenheimer reiterated its Outperform rating on the stock, writing:\\n\\n\"A focus on profitability moving forward, PYPL isn\\'t likely to have a quick fix, but new commentary suggests consolidation and refocus of investments to create stabilization in the business model.\"\\n\\nGoldman Sachs was also positive and said Chriss performed well on his first earnings call as CEO.\\n\\nShares were up 11.3% for the week to $56.10.\\n\\nBlock expecting cheery earnings\\n\\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) shares closed the week with a nearly-11% surge after the payments company raised its adjusted EBITDA forecast for the full year.\\n\\nIts Q3 adjusted profit came to $0.55 per share, well above the $0.47 estimate up 31% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 24% year over year to $5.62B, soaring past the $5.47B Street targets as its Cash App slightly exceeded estimates with 55M monthly transacting active accounts, 1.9% higher than last year.\\n\\nThe company also beefed up its prediction for full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, bringing the number up to $1.67B from the prior $1.5B and saying it expects the figure to reach $2.4B next year.\\n\\nBlock also announced a $1B stock buyback program.\\n\\nPiper Sandler cut the share-price target to $67 but reaffirmed its Overweight rating on SQ shares given the better-than-expected earnings estimates as the company \"[implements] a series of efficiency initiatives.\"\\n\\nRBC said the company \"laid down the gauntlet on materially improving profitability in the organization,\" citing a capped employee headcount, improved efficiency via automation, and \"gaining some leverage on stock comp heading into FY24.\"\\n\\nAll in all, the stock catapulted 21.6% for the week to $48.68.\\n\\nSenad Karaahmetovic and Yasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nApple\\'s wishy-washy guidance; AMD\\'s AI optimism: Weekly tech roundup\\n\\nBanking glitch causes deposit delays at major U.S. banks\\n\\nQualcomm\\'s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 promises superior performance in 2024', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-wishy-washy-guidance-amds-044508429.html', 'symbols': ['2PP.F', '2PP.XETRA', 'A1MD34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMD.F', 'AMD.MX', 'AMD.US', 'AMD.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'PYPL.US', 'PYPL34.SA', 'QCOM.US', 'SQ.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.999, 'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.134}}, {'date': '2023-11-05T03:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Big Western Brands Are Getting Squeezed by Chinese Belt-Tightening', 'content': 'Apple, Estée Lauder and Canada Goose are among those feeling the pinch from the country’s consumer slump.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/635032ed-d55b-3390-999f-1384efffbf8c/big-western-brands-are.html', 'symbols': ['1GC.F', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'EL.US', 'ELAA.F', 'GOOS.TO', 'GOOS.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.128, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.923, 'pos': 0.077}}, {'date': '2023-11-05T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nKeith Speights\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Nov 5, 2023\\n', 'content': \"The proverbial glass of water isn't half-empty for Apple, despite what some analysts might think.\", 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/11/05/wall-street-is-hating-on-apple-right-now-here-are/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-11-04T17:00:39+00:00', 'title': 'Starbucks leans into Apple, Microsoft, Amazon partnerships', 'content': 'Starbucks, which traces its origin to a small coffee shop in Seattle’s Pike Place Market in 1971, has come a long way, with 38,000-plus stores worldwide and a fresh plan to up its game with the help of Microsoft, Amazon and Apple.\\n\\nThe trio is one slice of a plan to grow the coffee giant under the direction of CEO Laxman Narasimhan, who has been in the role less than a year, after joining the company in March.\\n\\nNarasimhan and his team of executives rolled out a new strategy for growth Thursday in New York City, which includes $3 billion in savings, adding 55,000 stores globally by 2050 and doubling its 75,000 Rewards members with Big Tech helping to move the needle.\\n\\nSTARBUCKS ROLLS OUT \\'TRIPLE SHOT\\' FOR GROWTH\\n\\n\"We are also activating our digital relationships through personalized incentives that will entice customers to discover new products and establish new routines that boost all dayparts, including the afternoon\" Starbucks Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Brady Brewer told investors Thursday.\\n\\nHe noted the 26% growth of ‘All Day Breakfast’ into the afternoon hours. \"The combination of the right products, massive customer reach, and personalized marketing is a powerful driver of our business, as we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\" he added.\\n\\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\\n\\nSTARBUCKS HOLIDAY DRINKS, RED CUPS RELEASE DATE REVEALED: WHAT\\'S NEW AND WHAT\\'S RETURNING\\n\\nMicrosoft, already at work behind the scenes, is using its cloud technology, Azure, to process customer feedback, including how to improve the Starbucks mobile app. This type of \"personalization\" can help with food or drink preferences.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\n\\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup.\\n\\nThe all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3; M3 Pro; and M3 Max.\\n\\nWe're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace. And our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them.\\n\\nAnd in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.\\n\\nApple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new face time features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music.\\n\\nWhether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+ and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins.\\n\\nWe also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week.\\n\\nIn September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories, to lifesaving features like emergency SoS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise, the best products in the world should be the best products for the world.\\n\\nWe've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped, unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using a 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.\\n\\nApple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense a possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\\n\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. And on a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets.\\n\\nOur total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.\\n\\nProducts gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia .\\n\\nOur iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips.\\n\\nOur installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.\\n\\nWe had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem.\\n\\nAnd we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction.\\n\\nStarbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities.\\n\\nWe increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment.\\n\\nOur year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.\\n\\nThe color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.\\n\\nWe expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.\\n\\nWe expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is up an impressive 246% over the last five years. And in the last week the share price has popped 5.0%. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.\\n\\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Apple investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\\n\\nDuring five years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 28% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\\n\\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\\n\\nIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on Apple's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\\n\\nWhat About Dividends?\\n\\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Apple's TSR for the last 5 years was 260%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nIt's good to see that Apple has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 28% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 29% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Apple better, we need to consider many other factors.

Opportunities for growth exist in the form of favorable external factors and strategic initiatives. However, potential threats such as aggressive competition and reliance on single or limited sources for certain components could pose challenges.\\n\\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with ALGN.\\n\\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading player in the consumer electronics and services market, filed its SEC 10-K report on November 3, 2023. The company's financial performance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, reveals a net income of $96,995 million, a slight decrease from the previous year's $99,803 million. Despite this, the company's total net sales increased to $383,285 million from $365,817 million in 2021, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape Apple's strategic outlook. The Apple Inc (AAPL) Company: A Short SWOT Analysis\\n\\nStrengths\\n\\nStrong Brand and Loyal Customer Base: Apple's brand is one of its most significant assets. The company's reputation for quality, innovation, and design has helped it build a loyal customer base. This is reflected in its consistent sales growth, with total net sales increasing from $365,817 million in 2021 to $383,285 million in 2023.\\n\\nUnique Technology and Integrated Solutions: Apple's ability to design and develop nearly the entire solution for its products, including hardware, operating system, software applications, and related services, sets it apart from competitors. This integration of hardware and software provides a seamless user experience, contributing to customer loyalty and product differentiation.\\n\\nWeaknesses\\n\\nDependence on Single or Limited Sources for Certain Components: Apple relies on single or limited sources for certain components essential to its business. This dependence could pose supply chain risks, potentially impacting product availability and company performance.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIntense Competition: The consumer electronics and services market is highly competitive, with aggressive price competition and frequent introduction of new products. Competitors with broader product lines, lower-priced products, and larger installed bases pose a significant challenge to Apple.\\n\\nOpportunities\\n\\nExpansion into New Markets and Services: Apple's geographic segmentation strategy presents opportunities for growth in untapped markets. Additionally, the company's diverse range of services, such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay, offer avenues for revenue growth beyond its hardware products.\\n\\nTechnological Advancements: The rapid pace of technological advancement presents opportunities for Apple to introduce innovative new products and services. The company's significant investments in research and development position it well to capitalize on these opportunities.\\n\\nThreats\\n\\nAggressive Competition: Apple faces intense competition from companies that compete primarily through aggressive pricing and low-cost structures. Some competitors have the resources to provide products at little or no profit, posing a threat to Apple's market share and profitability.\\n\\nIntellectual Property Infringement: Many competitors seek to compete by imitating Apple's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country where Apple operates, posing a potential threat to its competitive advantage.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) boasts significant strengths such as a strong brand and unique technology, it must navigate challenges such as dependence on single or limited sources for certain components and intense competition. However, opportunities for expansion into new markets and services, coupled with the potential to capitalize on technological advancements, present promising growth prospects. The company must remain vigilant of threats such as aggressive competition and intellectual property infringement to maintain its market position.\\n\\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Roy Rochlin/WireImage\\n\\nApple (AAPL)reported earnings for the September quarter yesterday (Nov. 2). The iPhone maker’s overall sales declined for the fourth quarter in a row, sending its shares to fall in yesterday’s after-hours trading. But there are several bright spots in the earnings report, including its “services” business, which brought in $22.31 billion in quarterly revenue, up 16 percent from last year and an all-time high. Apple’s services sector includes Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple One bundles, where users can subscribe to up to six services. iCloud storage, the Apple Store, Apple Care and advertising are also considered services. Apple CEO Tim Cook shouted out AppleTV+ on the call and boasted the accomplishments of original titles like Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the FlowerMoon.\\n\\n“We’re telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul,” Cook said on yesterday’s earnings calls with analysts. Cook also highlighted the success of Apple’s partnership with Major League Soccer through the MLS Season Pass, saying subscriptions “exceeded expectations” within its first year.\\n\\n“We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago,” CFO Luca Maestri said on the call.\\n\\nServices make up around 25 percent of Apple’s total revenue. And the vast majority came from Google (GOOGL), which has an exclusive deal with Apple to make Google Search the default search engine on Apple devices. This year, Google is expected to pay Apple $19 billion for the search engine placement. During the September quarter, Apple brought in $89.5 billion in revenue and $22.96 billion in net income.\\n\\nCook said Apple’s services sector is expected to grow at a similar rate in the current quarter. CFO Maestri credited the growth in services for helping Apple’s gross margin, which was 45.2 percent in the past quarter. The margin is expected to be between 45 and 46 percent in the December quarter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMaestri did clarify while answering a question from David Vogt of United Bank of Switzerland that the growth in services is not comparable with the performance of Apple’s device business, which is likely to get a boost in revenue during the holiday season. The only product this past quarter that beat revenue expectations was the iPad. Sales of Macs and wearables, such as the Apple Watch, came lower than analysts had expected. iPhone sales, which accounted for about half of Apple’s revenue, matched estimates in the past quarter.\\n\\nTrending Observer Stories\\n\\nSofia Coppola's Adolescent, Gushing, Empty-Headed 'Priscilla' Sugarcoats Elvis Bill Gates Turns 68: His Top 10 Quotes on Money, Success and Life Craig Newmark of Craigslist Has a New Mission: Saving Democracy Martin Scorsese's Strengths Seem Wasted in 'Killers of the Flower Moon' 10 Extraordinary UNESCO Sites to Explore Across America\\n\\nRead the original story Apple TV+ Is a Bright Spot in Apple's Mixed Quarterly Earnings and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tv-bright-spot-apples-231651573.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.985, 'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.104}}, {'date': '2023-11-03T22:29:00+00:00', 'title': 'Weekly Roundup', 'content': \"United Rentals was the star this week for our portfolio, while we dropped Universal Display.

While Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) impressed with its latest report, Apple joined Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) in disappointing analysts despite delivering strong quarterly figures as space was left for growth-related concerns. Although Apple topped revenue and profit estimates, its revenue contracted for fourth straight quarter, a stretch it hasn’t made before it launched the iPhone back in 2007.\\xa0Shares fell as executives implied that the tech titan may not return to growth during the holiday quarter.\\n\\nQuarterly Highlights\\n\\nDuring the September quarter, Apple reported revenue dropped 1% YoY to $89.5 billion, topping LSEG’s estimate of $89.28 billion but still showing that Apple’s revenue continues to shrink as demand for every hardware business except the iPhone declined YoY, with big drops for iPad and Mac segments.\\xa0Revenue from greater China, its third largest market which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is also a reason for concern as it dropped 2.5% to $15.08 billion, missing estimates by $2 billion due to intense competition in the region with\\xa0Huawei's comeback. The revenue slip came despite an unexpectedly strong acceleration in its services business as well as the iPhone’s return to growth, helping the US consumer tech group withstand the worst effects of weaker consumer demand. However, CFO Luca Maestri noted that revenue would have risen had it not been for a 2 percentage point decline caused by exchange rate moves. Services revenue rose 16.3 per cent in the quarter, double the rate of the preceding three months and well ahead of the 11.4 per cent most analysts had been expecting\\xa0as it amounted to\\xa0$22.31 billion, topping LSEG’s estimate of\\xa0$21.35 billion\\xa0and being a rare bright spot.\\xa0The performance boosted Apple’s\\xa0quarterly\\xa0gross profit margin 45.2%,\\xa0which is a new\\xa0September quarter\\xa0record and Apple has its\\xa0\\xa0licensing deals with\\xa0Google to thank, along with its Apple Care, iCloud, TV+, etc.\\xa0A big chunk of the business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on\\xa0its\\xa0Safari\\xa0browser\\xa0which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google.\\xa0This year’s payment to\\xa0Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion.\\xa0Cook\\xa0also revealed that\\xa0Apple had over 1 billion paid subscriptions,\\xa0including both its own\\xa0services and apps on the\\xa0App Store that bill on a recurring basis.\\xa0Net income for the quarter\\xa0amounted to\\xa0$22.96 billion, or $1.46 per share\\xa0with earnings per share\\xa0rising\\xa013%\\xa0to $1.46 thanks to the higher margin\\xa0from Apple Store sale\\xa0commissions and the share of search advertising revenue it receives from Google\\xa0which fueled the services segment.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nView more earnings on AAPL\\n\\nFull year results The fiscal year that ended in September\\xa0ended with\\xa0Apple’s first revenue decline since a 2 per cent slip in 2019, with sales down\\xa03% at $383.29 billion.\\xa0Full year gross margins\\xa0were at a record\\xa044.1%. Although hardware revenue began to stabilise after\\xa0the first half of the year\\xa0during which\\xa0supply shortages and a\\xa0tormented\\xa0macroeconomic backdrop\\xa0dented\\xa0sales, it wasn’t enough to end the year\\xa0the year without a\\xa0further decline.\\xa0However, CEO\\xa0Tim Cook\\xa0spiritedly defended\\xa0Apple’s position, arguing that the iPhone appeared to gain market share in mainland China and increased sales\\xa0while the overall market is contracting.\\n\\nOutlook Was Lower Than What Wall Street Expected\\n\\nApple hasn’t provided any official guidance since 2020. But, Maestri did say that he expects flat\\xa0revenue for the\\xa0undergoing\\xa0quarter\\xa0which will be one week shorter compared to last year’s holiday quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts that guided for 5% YoY growth. Although\\xa0last year’s extra week made about 7% of quarterly revenue, Maestri’s expectations does imply that Apple is expecting challenges during the holiday season while facing a continued weakness on the Mac, iPad and Wearables front, despite a relatively positive outlook for iPhone sales.\\n\\nApple Is Also Simultaneously Aiming For Box Office And Streaming Glory\\n\\nApple has invested heavily on Scorsese’s latest creation, the Flower Moon. When it announced its collaboration with Paramount in 2020, the initial estimate of the film’s production costs were guided in the range\\xa0between $180 million and $200 million. Bloomberg recently estimated costs of this bold cinema bet rose to about\\xa0$250 million. Although this hybrid release model is a gamble, Apple’s intent is to convert\\xa0theater-goers into Apple TV+ subscribers. Even if it results in minor setbacks as\\xa0viewers might choose the immediate theater experience over waiting\\xa045 days\\xa0for an Apple TV+ release, Apple is strengthening its footprint in a very competitive industry.\\n\\nAnalysts Were Simply Expecting More From Apple\\n\\nLast week, Microsoft fueled optimism that\\xa0Big-Tech\\xa0is rebounding but Google and Apple toned down the optimism. Alphabet posted Cloud figures that raised concerns that Google is not gaining ground against its larger rivals nor benefiting from AI tailwinds. As for Apple,\\xa0analysts seem to think that it is lacking a clear path to growth this holiday season as its revenue contracted for the fourth consecutive quarter.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

That’s compared to declines in the US, China, and Europe.\\n\\n“We had an all-time revenue record in India,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s earnings call. “We grew very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have a low share in a large market. And so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.”\\n\\nAccording to Cook, Apple is banking on more people moving into the middle class and better distribution in the country as boons for its presence there.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment,” he added.\\n\\nIt’s not just India, though. Apple also launched new online stores in Chile, as well as Vietnam, where the company set new revenue records.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas (Francis Mascarenhas / reuters)\\n\\nMac sales to rebound\\n\\nApple’s Mac segment has been one of its biggest laggards among the company’s various businesses over the last several quarters. In Q4, in particular, revenue fell 34% year-over-year from $11.5 billion to $7.6 billion this year, a 34% decline. But things could be turning around.\\n\\nDuring the company’s earnings call, Maestri specifically called out the Mac business moving forward, saying that he expects year-over-year performance to “significantly accelerate in the current quarter.”\\n\\nThat’s because Apple just launched its new M3 line of chips, as well as its M3-powered MacBook Pros and iMac. The systems should help drive an uptick in sales, compared to the same time last year when sales were falling.\\n\\nIt’s important to also note that Apple’s iPad and Mac revenue in particular were stung by year-over-year comparisons that were warped by production slowdowns and a subsequent jump in sales during 2022. How long the M3 chips will buoy Mac sales, however, remains to be seen. Apple debuted its latest MacBook Pros during its Scary Fast event. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\\n\\nServices is still a standout\\n\\nWhile Apple’s hardware sales weren’t enough to knock anyone’s socks off, the company’s Services business was a solid standout.\\n\\nRevenue jumped from $19.2 billion in Q4 2022 to $22.3 billion this year. In fact, Services revenue rose each quarter last year, a stark contrast to the rest of Apple’s segments, which fell across various quarters.\\n\\n“The Apple flywheel is alive and well, following a 20-year success story in which consumers buy one Apple product, fall in love, buy another product, add a service, upgrade, and repeat,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in an investor note.\\n\\nServices has long been seen as Apple’s best hedge against falling iPhone sales, and with the declines over the last year, Services has been a help for the company’s margins.\\n\\nFor 2024, Vogt says he expects Services revenue to increase 12% versus 2023 to $95.4 billion.\\n\\nWhile worries still abound among investors as to whether Apple’s hardware segments will rebound after a difficult 2023, next year has a number of potential opportunities ahead, including more MacBook’s running Apple’s new M3 chips, and, importantly, the launch of the Vision Pro headset. And while that won’t be a volume seller out of the gate, it could goose numbers in the future. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

So, it’s not just like send $20 to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank account.”\\n\\nPerhaps he will succeed. X has roughly 550 million active users and a payment processing system already in place. The firm also has licenses for money transmission and services in nine U.S. states, according to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System. Most tellingly, Musk has even rebranded Twitter to the “X.com” name — the trademark he tried converting PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) into before getting ousted as CEO in 2000. He has the rare combination of money, willpower, and a lack of decorum to make things happen.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nBut these efforts to turn X into a financial hub are doing things the hard way. Because instead of buying Twitter…\\n\\n…Elon Musk should have repurchased PayPal instead.\\n\\nPayPal: The Diamond in the Rough\\n\\nIt’s been a tough several years for PayPal, an electronic payments company that’s seen its share prices drop 85% since 2021. Over the past two years, analysts have cut their forward earnings estimates for PayPal from $7.20 per share to $4.95, sending PYPL stock into freefall.\\n\\nThe problem stems from a surge in expenses, driven by rising volumes of low-margin business and an uptick in credit losses. Credit card defaults are now growing at the fastest pace since the 2008 financial crisis. The growth of peer-to-peer transactions has also increased fraud rates.\\n\\nHowever, these downbeat figures have turned an otherwise growing company into a deep value play. Markets now value PayPal at only $56 billion — not much more than the $44 billion Elon Musk paid for Twitter.\\n\\nAt current prices, PayPal sits at just 11x free cash flow or 9.2x forward earnings — levels more typically seen at zero-growth industrial companies or struggling banks. Prices are so low that the company’s $5-billion-per-year of free cash flow could theoretically pay for the entire company in just over seven years. (Twitter was bleeding $379 million annually when Musk took over).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMeanwhile, PayPal’s business continues to march ahead. Analysts expect PayPal’s sales to increase between 7%-9% annually through at least 2025 and for earnings per share to return to double-digit growth after this year.\\n\\nThat’s because PayPal’s customer acquisition strategy largely relies on network effects, which costs virtually nothing to maintain. The company spends just over 10% on its entire sales and marketing team. By comparison, Capital One (NYSE:COF) pours a stunning 21% of its operating budget into marketing expenses. It’s far cheaper to install a yellow “PayPal Checkout” button on a website than to get real-life customers to sign up for a “What’s In Your Wallet” credit card.\\n\\nThat’s turned PayPal into a profit-spinning machine despite lower margins. The company’s return on capital exceeds 33%, and analysts expect free cash flows to rise double-digits through 2026.\\n\\nThe Actual Everything App\\n\\nMusk, however, might be even more interested in PayPal for its ownership of Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments app that PayPal acquired in 2013 through its purchase of Braintree. The service now counts at least 90 million accounts in the U.S., or 1 for every 3.5 people. Payment volumes are also surging. In Q2 2022, PayPal noted that Venmo saw a 250% transaction growth.\\n\\nThat’s because Venmo enjoys even more robust network effects than PayPal. Venmo’s peer-to-peer payment network only works if both parties have the same app, which means winners in the industry tend to keep growing while laggards are left behind. It’s much like the Betamax vs. VHS wars of the 1980s. Once a standard is adopted, it’s hard to switch to anything else.\\n\\nAt the moment, Venmo appears to be on the VHS side of that equation. The company has been using Cash App’s playbook to acquire customers, offering cash prizes to sign up young users. The subsidiary has also been working with vendors and online merchants to serve Venmo as a payment option and broadening its reach beyond a peer-to-peer model.\\n\\nMost importantly (especially to Musk), Venmo and PayPal are expanding their credit and debit card offerings. This month, the firm announced that iPhone users will now be able to add these cards to their Apple Wallet, essentially cutting out the commercial bank middle-man. It’s effectively becoming the center of users’ financial worlds — or what Musk dreams X might someday become.\\n\\nThe Need for Patience\\n\\nOf course, an investment in PayPal comes with risks. My MarketMasterAI stock-picking system awards PayPal a C grade for its negative momentum and analyst downgrades. History tells us that falling stocks usually keep going down before a recovery. According to the quantitative system, PayPal’s expected stock return is only 2.3% over the next six months.\\n\\nPayPal is also facing growing competition… not least from Musk’s X app. In 2019, the payments sector saw several blockbuster acquisitions consolidating the market. Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) acquired Worldpay in a $43 billion deal, Fiserv (NYSE:FI) scooped up First Data for $22 billion, and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion. These efforts were aimed directly at competing against PayPal.\\n\\nFinally, PayPal’s move into debit and credit cards comes with banking-related risks. In 2022, the company booked $402 million in credit losses, representing around 6.8% of all outstanding loans. Much of this increase came from buy-now-pay-later products, which typically have high default rates. As PayPal continues to add banking-related services to its product lineup, investors will need to price the firm more like a bank, which typically trades at significant discounts.\\n\\nLessons From Apple Pay\\n\\nNevertheless, the experience of Apple Pay tells us why it would have been easier for Elon Musk to buy PayPal instead of converting Twitter into a financial hub.\\n\\nIn 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook proclaimed that his firm would “forever change the way all of us buy things.” His firm launched Apple Pay that October and aggressively pursued merchants to adopt the system. By 2019, even the New York transit system allowed Apple Pay on subways and buses.\\n\\nHowever, even Apple couldn’t get its customers to switch.\\n\\nAccording to a study by Capital One, only 9.3% of iPhone owners used Apple Pay for in-store purchases in 2022. That’s despite Apple Pay being accepted at 90% of U.S. retail stores. Even high-yield Apple savings accounts — which currently yield 4.15% APRs— have struggled to gain customers. The $10 billion deposited into Apple Card’s savings accounts is just $6.85 per active iPhone user.\\n\\nThat’s because banking habits are hard to change. According to Bankrate, the average U.S. consumer holds onto the same checking account for 17.75 years. Younger millennials under 32 have kept their checking accounts for over nine years. There’s a reason why local banks and credit unions give handsome sign-up bonuses for new accounts. Nine years of Apple Pay has only given the Cupertino-based firm a 12.62% share of the online payments market.\\n\\nThen there’s PayPal, a company that controls 56.15% of online payments. Its shares are trading at multi-year lows. It’s highly profitable. It generates plenty of cash. And it’s available on public markets for you and me to buy. Better act now before Musk decides to make another purchase.\\n\\nAs of this writing, Tom Yeung\\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He called out the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) in Berkshire Hathaway\\'s 2022 shareholder letter, stating, \"[Dividend] growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays.\"\\n\\nBuffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola, obtaining 400 million shares in 1994 when it generated a dividend income of $75 million. As of 2022, annual dividends from Coca-Cola shares have catapulted to $704 million — a more than 800% rise in less than three decades.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway\\'s stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion as of 2022, marking a more than 1,800% rise from the initial investment of $1.3 billion. As of last year, Coca-Cola stock accounted for approximately 5% of Berkshire Hathaway\\'s total holdings.\\n\\nAmerican Express Co.\\n\\nBuffett made similar gains from his investment in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP). He invested nearly $1.3 billion in American Express in 1995, which is now valued at $22 billion. This marks a nearly 1,600% rise in valuation.\\n\\nCapital gains are not the only benefit American Express stock has generated for Buffett. The world\\'s largest portfolio manager also pocketed dividend income of $302 million from his American Express holdings in 2022, up from $41 million during the initial investment in 1995.\\n\\n\"Those [American Express dividend] checks, too, seem highly likely to increase,\" Buffett said in Berkshire Hathaway\\'s 2022 shareholder letter. American Express shares also account for nearly 5% of Hathaway\\'s net worth.\\n\\nApple Inc.\\n\\nWhile Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not considered a dividend stock by most investors, the tech giant\\'s dividend payouts have made the stock one of Buffett\\'s family jewels. Berkshire Hathaway holds a nearly 5.8% stake in Apple.\\n\\nBuffett describes Apple as a \"better business than any we own.\" He credits his substantial stake in Apple to multiple share repurchases executed by the company over the years, making it \"costless\" for Berkshire Hathaway to increase its Apple stock holdings.\\n\\nBuffett\\'s dividend income from Apple averaged about $775 million annually as of 2020, according to Berkshire Hathaway\\'s 2020 shareholder letter.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China Mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and an all-time record in India.\\r\\nIn Services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds, and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and managed for the long term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending.\\r\\nAnd we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year.\\r\\nNow let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone 15 Pro lineup has a beautiful, strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5x telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts.\\r\\nIn Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace, and our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our pro users while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly 2 out of 3 college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future.\\r\\nTurning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets, and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life while giving students a window into the world around them. And in artist's workshops, design studios, and everywhere else creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas further than they ever could before.\\r\\nAcross Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just 1 hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.\\r\\nApple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new FaceTime features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17 or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving.\\r\\nServices revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services and video as well as a September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day.\\r\\nApple TV+ continues to delight customers as well with new and returning shows like The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch, we're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+, and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch just over 4 years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins.\\r\\nWe also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home the MLS Cup.\\r\\nAnd nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the U.K. and expanded the Apple Store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable.\\r\\nEvery time we connect with a customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories to life-saving features like Emergency SOS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values.\\r\\nOur environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise: the best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped unless everyone steps up and does their part.\\r\\nOur first-ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone, and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon-neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third Impact Accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.\\r\\nApple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense of possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determine to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points, and on a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits.\\r\\nProducts revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our total installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem.\\r\\nOur Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services was broad-based as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category.\\r\\nCompany gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion.\\r\\nLet me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India and September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switchers. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S.\\r\\nMac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and we are subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing, with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips. Our installed base is at an all-time high, and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S.\\r\\niPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base, with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S.\\r\\nWearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year. We had a September quarter record in Europe, and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach, with nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S.\\r\\nServices had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high.\\r\\nAlso, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only 3 years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love these new offerings.\\r\\nTurning to enterprise, we are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction. Starbucks continues to invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to their customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity.\\r\\nAnd in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work.\\r\\nLet me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares.\\r\\nTaking a step back as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant currency basis despite a volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year and so did our earnings per share performance as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter.\\r\\nWe are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets, with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us.\\r\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point.\\r\\nAs a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having 1 less week this year, we expect our December quarter total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the 1 extra week.\\r\\nWe expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad tenth generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearables category, last year, we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra.\\r\\nFor our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.\\r\\nFinally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\\n\\nSuhasini Chandramouli\\n\\nThank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions) Operator, may we have the first question, please?\\n\\nQuestion and Answer Session\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nMichael Ng\\n\\nI just have a question on iPhone storage and demand versus iCloud. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix shift towards higher storage iPhone models? Or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of iCloud+? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here and trade-offs as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus iCloud penetration?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nMichael, it's Tim. As you probably know, we started the line with the iPhone Pro Max at 256, and so we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant changes.\\n\\nMichael Ng\\n\\nAnd as a separate follow-up, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops. And any color that you can share regarding the timing of the M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the M2 earlier in the calendar year?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nYes. We're thrilled to have announced the M3 lineup and get the new MacBook Pro and the new iMac out there. We couldn't be more excited about it. As Luca said, with the lineup that we've got and the compare issue that we don't have during Q1, we anticipate a significant acceleration in the Mac space for Q1.\\r\\nTo just repeat a little bit about the circumstances of the performance last quarter, in the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in the September quarter. And that made the September quarter not only a record but a substantial record. And obviously, we're now comparing against that for '23. And so that -- I wouldn't look at the negative 34% as representative of the underlying business performance, is sort of the net of it.\\n\\nMichael Ng\\n\\nExcellent. That's very clear.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\\n\\nAaron Christopher Rakers\\n\\nCongratulations on the execution in the quarter. I'm curious, Tim, if you could help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like? How has the reception been to the iPhone 15? And kind of a similar question to the prior one. How would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle? And I have a follow-up.\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nYes. If you look at how we did in Greater China for the quarter, we came in at, on revenue basis, minus 2. But one thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly 6 points. So we grew in constant currency. And underneath that, if you look at the different -- the categories, iPhone actually set a September quarter record in Mainland China.\\r\\nAnd the -- what pulled down the performance was a combination largely of Mac and iPad. Services also grew during the quarter. And the Mac and iPad suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to factory disruptions in Q3 that were filled subsequently in Q4 of '22. In addition to that, we had the top 4 selling phones in urban China for last year. And I was -- I just -- I took a trip over there and could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees and others.\\n\\nAaron Christopher Rakers\\n\\nYes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious as we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment. Luca, how do we think about that effect or how you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level as maybe component pricing starts to turn what's been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment?\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nAs you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin. The 45.2% was a record for the September quarter, and then the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45% to 46%. Our gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them, as you mentioned. It's been a good environment in recent quarters. But equally important is the mix of what we sell, and obviously, growth in Services for us is favorable. And that has helped our company gross margin.\\r\\nForeign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for several quarters, given the strength of the dollar. We don't provide guidance past the December quarter, which is like a very important one for us because it's the beginning of the product cycle for many products. And so we feel very good, very confident about this coming year, and I think the gross margin guidance reflects that.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nErik William Richard Woodring\\n\\nMaybe if I start -- Luca, I know that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are constrained today, but I think some of your comments suggest you should be back to supply-demand balance before quarter end. So I guess my question is, does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? And if so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance? And then I have a follow-up.\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nYes, it's correct. We are constrained today on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply-demand balance by the end of the quarter, so the guidance reflects that.\\n\\nErik William Richard Woodring\\n\\nOkay, very clear. And then maybe for you and Tim, you guys have been on the leading edge of innovation across hardware, software, silicon services. And I'm sure there's plenty of technologies and kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year '24, just given over the last few years, CapEx as a percentage of revenue has been relatively low compared to the 8 years prior?\\r\\nSo should we expect a step up or kind of similar capital intensity? And what are the more notable moving pieces, if any, that we should be thinking about?\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nWell, the big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants, our investments in data centers, and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. And so both for the tooling in our plants and our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners and suppliers. And so maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability.\\r\\nBut over the last few years, we made all the investments that we needed to make. And obviously, we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\\n\\nDavid Vogt\\n\\nI know you covered China. I want to pivot to the U.S. for a second. Obviously, iPhone and the business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter, but it's still relatively softer, kind of where I thought it would be at this point in the cycle. And some of the U.S. carriers obviously haven't been that particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. So just wanted to kind of get a sense, first, what you're seeing from your partners in the U.S. kind of currently and going forward, and what do you expect?\\r\\nAnd then second, Luca, on the margins. I mean, is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus Services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to, let's say, the December quarter? Or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margin?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nOn the U.S. carriers and the U.S. business in general, it's really too early to call the iPhone cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and the Pro Max, and the U.S. tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be.\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nOn the margin side, if I understood your question correctly about the December quarter guidance, keep in mind that actually, December is the quarter where our products business is -- tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season. And so the Services gross margins that are accretive to total company have an impact but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year.\\r\\nAnd so I think that the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs and improved mix on our the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.\\n\\nDavid Vogt\\n\\nGot it. So the weakness in iPad and Wearables are less of an impact on sort of the margin trajectory in the December quarter, I guess?\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nThat's correct, that's correct.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\\n\\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\\n\\nI have 2 as well. I guess first off, just the Services growth rate, there was a tremendous acceleration, I think, in September quarter to 16% growth. And it sounds like it's going to hold there pretty well into December. Can you just talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have just stepped up in a very meaningful way? Just maybe flush out like what is driving the acceleration because it's fairly notable compared to what you've been seeing the last few quarters.\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nWe had a really strong quarter across the border, I mean, because both geographically and from a product category standpoint, we saw very significant growth. I mentioned the records on a geographic basis. And from a category standpoint, literally, we set records in each one of the big categories. We had all-time record for App Store, for advertising, for cloud, video, Apple Care, Payments and a September quarter record for Music. So it's hard to pick one in particular because they all did well. And really then we step back and we think about why is it that our Services business is doing well, and it's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice pace, and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow.\\r\\nWe have more transacting accounts. We have more paid accounts. We have more subscriptions on the platform. And we continue to add. We continue to add content and features. We're adding a lot of content on TV+, new games on Apple Arcade, new features, new storage plans for iCloud. So it's the combination of all these things and the fact that the engagement in the ecosystem is improving, and therefore, it benefits every Service category.\\n\\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\\n\\nGot it, that's really helpful. And then maybe if I could ask you about Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024, the early part of the year. I'm curious how different do you think the launch and the consumer education of this product or a new category will be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done? And then perhaps any themes that stood out to you from the developers that have been able to use this in the developer labs? What feedback have you gotten from them?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nYes, that's a great question. There's a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro, and we're -- we've been very happy to share it with developers. We have developer labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps. And I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those. And there's some real blow away kinds of things that are coming out. And so that all looks good.\\r\\nTo answer your question about, is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch? I would say no, there's never been a product like the Vision Pro. And so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores, and it will be a very different process than the normal grab-and-go kind of process.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\\n\\nHarsh V. Kumar\\n\\nCongratulations on tremendous execution in a very tough macro. Actually, Tim, the last question is a perfect segue here, given what you are doing with your Vision Pro. So lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have. I'm sure there are segways into Pro Vision (sic) [Vision Pro] that you have. But I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts with generative AI.\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nIf you kind of zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. And so just recently, when we shipped iOS 17, it had features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. And then you can go all the way to then life-saving features on the Watch and the phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI.\\r\\nAnd so we don't label them as such, if you will. We label them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have -- obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is because as you know, we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit. We are going to do it responsibly. And it will -- you will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of them.\\n\\nHarsh V. Kumar\\n\\nVery clear. And for my follow-up, I had a philosophical question. So you guys always try to provide the best experience for consumers. To that end, I think over the last decade, you in-sourced a lot of important chips in your phones and your Macs, iPads, so on and so forth. And that was, I think, a function that ARM wasn't around in the industry from a merchant angle. But now we see these -- the silicon guys, the chip guys moving to ARM architecture.\\r\\nSo my question to you is, has the move to internal silicon been economically profitable proposition for Apple? Or is it a strategic one where you simply need to own this and it's vital to your products for the consumer experience? Or maybe there's a path back to chip vendors at some point in time?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nIt's really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. And as you know, we like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship. And arguably, the silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies. And so no, I don't see going back. I am happier today than I was yesterday, than I was last week, that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\\n\\nWamsi Mohan\\n\\nTim, over the last decade pretty much, you've gained a lot of share in China. As you look here, some of the domestic players are starting to reemerge, especially in the high-end phone space. I know you touched on China, but how would you see Apple's positioning and opportunity for continued share gains, particularly in China? And how was the linearity in China from a demand perspective? And I have a follow-up, please.\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nIn the September quarter, we set an iPhone record -- revenue record in China, and we're very proud of that. And we obviously grew. The market predictions that I've seen would have the market contracting. And so if that's -- if those are correct, then we gained share last quarter. And so we're very proud of that. I don't know what every quarter will hold, and obviously, we just give a bit of color on the current quarter. But over the long term, I view China is an incredibly important market and I'm very optimistic about it.\\n\\nWamsi Mohan\\n\\nOkay. And as a follow-up, you obviously had a great Services quarter. And part of your Services business has these licensing relationships with search partners where you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options maybe Apple has to mitigate some of the risk, given some of the scrutiny on -- with some of these search partners?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nThey are important relationships. And as you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call. I see them as important and we make decisions that are in the best interest of our users or what we feel is in the best interest of our users. And that's kind of what we've done in the past and how we run the show in the future as well.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\\n\\nKrish Sankar\\n\\nI have 2 of them, too. First one, Luca, thanks for the color on gross margin. And when I look at it over the last 4 quarters, even if on a year-over-year basis, revenue declined, the gross margins have improved, and I understand Services definitely helps. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at on a go-forward basis, most of the big step functions and cost reductions like the Mac silicon conversion, et cetera, that are done? Or is there more room for margin expansion from here? And then I have a follow-up.\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nWell, on the products side, as you know, we -- when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It happens because we're always adding new technologies, new features, and then we work through the cost curve over the life cycle of the product, and we tend to get benefits as time goes by.\\r\\nThe guidance that we provided for December reflects all that. And so we're starting from a better position than a year ago or than in the past in general. There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile. And so our guidance, our results are reflective of that. And also within a specific product category, a lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they have different margin profiles.\\r\\nI think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trading options and low-cost financing in general. And what that is accomplished is reduce the affordability threshold for our customers, and therefore, they can buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion.\\r\\nYou know we don't provide guidance or color past the current quarter because there's so many different variables that affect gross margins. But we obviously feel very good about the trajectory that we've had in 2023 and now the guidance that we provide for the beginning of our fiscal '24. And we need some of these things because, obviously, the foreign exchange environment has been difficult and has been a bit of a drag for us. But net-net, we're very pleased where we are.\\n\\nKrish Sankar\\n\\nGot it. And then a follow-up for Tim. Obviously, you're seeing amazing momentum in India. I'm just kind of curious, how do you look at -- when you look at the India growth opportunity, on these hardware units? How do you think about ASP relative to that versus like the rest of the geographies? And is there a way to compare or contrast India growth momentum versus China maybe a decade ago or so at the same point as the rollout of the share gains in that geography?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nYes, it's a great question. We had an all-time revenue record in India. We grew very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have low share in a large market. And so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.\\r\\nThe ASPs, I haven't looked at them most recently but I'm sure that they're lower than the worldwide. But that doesn't bother us at all. It just -- and in terms of the similarity, I would say each country has its own journey and I wouldn't want to play the comparison game, but we see an extraordinary market, a lot of people moving into the middle class, distribution is getting better, lots of positives. We put 2 retail stores there, as you know. They're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going but they're off to a good start. And I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\\n\\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\\n\\nTim, I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there or your optimism. I wanted to also ask about the supply chain. And where is your priority -- do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain? How do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world? And in particular, what do you think about further investments in the U.S. as well?\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nOur supply chain is truly global, and so we're investing all over the world, including in the United States. We were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the U.S. and have worked on a number of different projects in the U.S., whether it's our venture with Corning on the glass or the Face ID module or semiconductors. And so all of these are advanced manufacturing, and I think exactly the kinds of things that the U.S. would be and are very, very good at.\\r\\nWe also invest in other regions of the world and we're continually optimizing the chain. And so we -- the moment we learn something that didn't work exactly right, we are tweaking it. And so we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of the day, it will still be a global supply chain.\\n\\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\\n\\nGot it. Next one for Luca. Just really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was also, last year, an issue with the iPhone production, where there was the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what that -- I guess, having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year, what that benefit is this year and maybe contrast that with the 7-point hit from the extra week?\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nYes. Thanks for the question, Ben. I mentioned during the prepared remarks, the extra week is 7 points of revenue. We did have disruptions, supply disruptions last year on the phone, on the 14 Pro and Pro Max in the December quarter a year ago. And when we normalize for those 2 factors, I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on iPhone. So you take into account the loss of the extra week, you compare it with the supply disruptions that are not going to repeat hopefully this year. And when you normalize for those 2 things, we still expect to grow on iPhone.\\n\\nSuhasini Chandramouli\\n\\nAnd we'll take the last question now.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur last question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\\n\\nRichard Alan Kramer\\n\\nTim, first off, if we look over the past 2 years, Apple's sales are about $18 billion higher and R&D is up by about 8% -- $8 billion or over 1/3 higher. Can you give us a sense of some of the main components or drivers behind that increase in innovation spend? Is it Apple silicon? Is it new products like Vision Pro or is it content to support new services? I think that's one of the top questions investors have.\\n\\nTimothy D. Cook\\n\\nSure. It's a number of things, Richard. It's the -- some things I can't talk about. It's Vision Pro. It's AI and ML. It's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon. It's sort of all of those things. But I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others.\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nAnd I would add, Richard, on this front, some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also one of the drivers for the gross margin expansion. So I think it's important to think about it that way.\\n\\nRichard Alan Kramer\\n\\nThat's great. And Luca, you mentioned, or Tim mentioned college students choosing Macs and you mentioned the record Services revenue. What other metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures and increases customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with relatively lower-priced products or even refurbished devices? So you're growing your ecosystem but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run?\\n\\nLuca Maestri\\n\\nWell, some of the metrics that I've mentioned before, obviously, we look at the installed base of active devices. We see -- we want to make sure that the customers that we acquire remain with us, and so we have good visibility over that, and we pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the installed base, both by product and by geography. And then we look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem.\\r\\nSo that's why we pay a lot of attention on things like transacting accounts, paid accounts. We want to see if, in fact, we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us. And so there's obvious -- we keep track of all these things. And that's -- and then what we do because I think it's really important is that over time, we add new services, and that, obviously -- like for example, the progress that we made in payments in recent years, very, very important because we've attracted more and more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices, and we are able to monetize that, right?\\r\\nSo we take all that into account. We understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device. We understand the behavior in different markets and so on. So we have, I think, pretty good visibility. And I think the progress that we're making in Services, we did $85 billion in the last 12 months. That's the size of a Fortune 50 and significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.\\n\\nSuhasini Chandramouli\\n\\nThank you, Richard.

A key factor that separates evergreen businesses from others is necessity versus luxury. The latter will have volatile demand depending on the economic scenario. The manufacturers of necessity have a relatively stable cash flow profile. Of course, this is not the only screener. In a world dominated by technology, there can be necessities that are not so obvious like food and water.\\n\\nInvesting in growth stocks is important to ensure that portfolio returns swell. However, I would invest 30% to 50% of the portfolio in evergreen stocks for long-term wealth generation. This can be in the form of dividends, share repurchases, and capital gains.\\n\\nLet’s discuss seven stocks to buy for long-term wealth creation.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nStocks to Buy for Long-Term Wealth: Newmont (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\\n\\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\\n\\nIn a global scenario where inflation, geopolitical tensions, and swelling government debt are concerns, gold is likely to trend higher. The precious metal recently traded above $2,000 an ounce and I’m bullish on upside. A good proxy for investing in gold is exposure to gold mining stocks. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is among the best mining stocks that trades at attractive valuations and offers a dividend yield of 4.27%.\\n\\nThe first reason to like Newmont is an investment grade balance sheet. As of Q2 2023, Newmont reported a liquidity buffer of $6.2 billion. Further, with net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA of 0.7, the Company has high financial flexibility for organic and acquisition driven growth.\\n\\nThe second reason to like the Company is high-quality assets. Even if we leave aside the recent acquisition of Newcrest Mining (OTCMKTS:NCMGF), the Company has quality tier one assets. There is clear production visibility into the 2040s and this implies sustained cash flow upside.\\n\\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\\n\\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe largest growth driver for the U.S. economy is consumption spending. Within this, retail expenditure is a critical component. I would therefore remain invested in quality retail stocks. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best bet.\\n\\nAmidst macroeconomic challenges, COST stock has trended higher by 22% for year-to-date. Further, the stock provides a dividend yield of 0.74% and I see visibility for sustained dividend growth.\\n\\nAn important point to note is that Costco has 861 warehouses globally. However, it’s largely concentrated in U.S. and Canada. Currently, the Company is generating $4.6 billion in membership fee with a 92.7% renewal rate in U.S. and Canada. The number of warehouses in China currently stands at five. I expect significant expansion in China in the coming years, which will boost recurring membership fee.\\n\\nLeaving aside this factor, Costco continues to report healthy comparable store sales growth. For October, comparable sales increased by 3% on a year-on-year basis. With strong omni-channel sales presence, Costco is well positioned to benefit.\\n\\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOil and gas stocks are cyclical in nature and investors would question the reason for including Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) here. I would point out that Chevron managed to generate positive cash flows even during the pandemic year when oil plunged to historic lows.\\n\\nChevron has high quality assets that have a low break-even. Last year, Brent oil averaged $100.93 per barrel and Chevron delivered operating cash flow of $47.5 billion. With an investment grade balance sheet and robust cash flows, Chevron is positioned to create value.\\n\\nRecently, Chevron announced the acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) for a consideration of $53 billion. Post this acquisition, the Company will be investing $19 to $22 billion annually. This will ensure healthy reserve replacement and steady production growth.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that Chevron has already announced an 8% increase in quarterly dividend per share to $1.63. Given the high geopolitical tensions, I expect oil to trade above $80 per barrel. Dividend growth visibility therefore remains robust for the coming years.\\n\\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\\n\\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is another name among stocks to buy for long-term wealth. When talking about the defense sector, I must remind investors that global defense spending increased even during the pandemic year. With rise in geopolitical tensions, I expect defense spending growth to accelerate further. Lockheed is well positioned to benefit and create value.\\n\\nTalking about fundamentals, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $156 billion as of Q3 2023. The order intake has been robust and as the backlog increases, revenue growth can potentially accelerate. At the same time, free cash flows will swell and translate into higher dividends. For the current year, Lockheed has guided for FCF of $6.2 billion.\\n\\nAs a part of the growth strategy, Lockheed is looking at expanding international collaborations. Orders from NATO member states will ensure growth. Further, the Company is investing in next-generation technology that includes hypersonic aircraft, among others. These factors will ensure that Lockheed remains a value creator.\\n\\nAstraZeneca (AZN) Exterior of the AstraZeneca\\'s manufacturing facility at Snackviken\\n\\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock has been largely sideways in the last 12 months. This does not come as a surprise with biopharmaceutical companies being dumped by investors in a post-pandemic world.\\n\\nHowever, this sell-off presents a golden opportunity to accumulate as top biopharma companies represent more than just growth from the covid-19 vaccine. There are multiple medical conditions of global concern with a big addressable market.\\n\\nAZN stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.4 and offers a dividend yield of 1.47%. Coming to the business, AstraZeneca currently has 172 projects in its research pipeline. Further, 14 molecular entities are in the late-stage pipeline. This will ensure steady revenue growth in the coming years.\\n\\nAnother point to note is that the company believes that there are ten potential blockbuster opportunities from 30 Phase III trials planned in 2023. Clearly, the pipeline is attractive and makes a strong case for investing in AZN stock.\\n\\nI also like the fact that the company is well diversified globally. For the first half of 2023, the Company reported 40% of revenue from outside the U.S. and Europe. Strong presence in emerging economies is likely to be a major growth catalyst.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the background\\n\\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\\n\\nFor years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a value creator. The reasons being the brand positioning and innovation. The same factors will continue to ensure that AAPL stock creates wealth in the long-term. In my view, AAPL stock is among the best dividend growth stocks to consider. My point is underscored by the Company’s cash flow potential.\\n\\nHowever, that’s not the only reason to be bullish on Apple. In the last quarter, Apple reported record revenue from the services segment. Further, the wearables business has ample headroom for growth globally. Apple will also be investing $1 billion annually towards artificial intelligence devices. There continues to be speculation about Apple’s electric car that seems to be scheduled for launch in 2026.\\n\\nTherefore, there is a strong case for diversification driven growth. I must add that Apple is also focusing on markets like India and Southeast Asia. Emerging markets (excluding China) have the potential to accelerate revenue growth.\\n\\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\\n\\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a hated stock among lot of analysts since listing. However, the Company navigated an extended period of cash burn and created immense value. With positive tailwinds for electric vehicles likely to last beyond the decade, I remain bullish on TSLA stock.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Tesla has set an ambitious target of producing 20 million electric vehicles annually by 2030. To achieve this target, the Company is likely to invest in few more factories in the coming years. India and Indonesia are some potential locations in emerging markets.\\n\\nI also like the fact that Tesla currently has an attractive product line-up. Cybertruck, Roadster, and Tesla Semi will ensure that deliveries growth is healthy. Further, the launch of Tesla Semi would mark the Company’s entry into commercial EVs.\\n\\nFrom a financial perspective, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $8.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Further, the Company has $26 billion in cash and equivalents. This provides high financial flexibility to make aggressive investments for growth.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Maestri also said the company is expecting revenue for Mac, iPad, and Wearables categories to \"decelerate significantly\" from the fourth quarter.\\n\\nMaersk (AMKBY)\\n\\nShares in one of the world’s biggest shipping companies tanked in pre-trading after it announced it will cut 10,000 jobs.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAP Moller-Maersk reported a drop $10.6bn (£8.7bn) in revenues across the third quarter as underlying pre-tax profits plunged 82% to $1.9bn amid “substantially lower freight rates”.\\n\\n“If you want an economic bellwether, look no further than Maersk, as its status as one of the world’s largest container shipping companies makes it a fair proxy for global growth,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.\\n\\n“Transportation demand will be strong if the economy is going well, but the opposite will apply if there are clouds on the horizon. Maersk’s 9% share price slump on its latest results would suggest the global economy is losing speed,” he added.\\n\\nThe Danish group is slashing its workforce from 110,000 in January to below 100,000 as it looks to cut costs by $600m (£491m) next year.\\n\\nChief executive Vincent Clerc said: “Our industry is facing a new normal with subdued demand, prices back in line with historical levels and inflationary pressure on our cost base.\\n\\n“Since the summer, we have seen overcapacity across most regions triggering price drops and no noticeable uptick in ship recycling or idling.\\n\\nMaersk said it had already cut around 6,500 jobs since early 2023 and that another 3,500 would go as it ramps up cost-saving actions.\\n\\nUp to 2,500 of those additional cuts will go in the “coming months”, with the remainder in 2024, it added.\\n\\nPalantir (PLTR)\\n\\nShares of Palantir rose nearly 20% Thursday and were higher in extended trading as the company updated its fourth-quarter guidance thanks to an increased demand for its AI platform.\\n\\nPalantir’s revenue for the third quarter increased 17% to $558m, from $478m a year earlier. The Denver-based company now expects $2.216bn to $2.22bn in revenue for 2023.

It’s also the biggest underperformer in that group, and there are signs Wall Street’s excitement is fading.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried Convicted of Fraud in Stunning FTX Crash Amazon’s Jeff Bezos Announces Move to Miami From Seattle Hedge Fund Executive’s Sudden Death Exposes a Firm Deep in Trouble Intuit Is Closing Personal-Finance App Mint, Shifts Users to Credit Karma Harvard, Yale Warned by Top Law Firms About Antisemitism\\n\\nThe EV behemoth stands out as the only one of the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index — a group that also includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — whose estimated profit for 2024 has declined significantly from where it was a year ago.\\n\\nTesla shares have been the worst performer in the group by a significant margin, since the third-quarter earnings season kicked off in mid-October. The stock sank fast after the company’s chief executive officer Elon Musk dialed back growth expectations amid slowing demand and dour forecasts from other automakers.\\n\\nFor the most recognizable EV brand and the largest pure-play EV-maker globally, the slowdown means further scrutiny on Tesla’s premium market valuation of about $690 billion — a level that leaves little room for error. Its share of bullish ratings is at the lowest since April 2021, reflecting growing skepticism.\\n\\n“The outlook for EV demand is a big problem for Tesla,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “Their continued price cuts are taking their toll, so lower demand is only going to exacerbate this issue.”\\n\\nShares of the company trade at 56 times their forward earnings, compared with the mid-single-digit multiples of legacy auto companies General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More importantly, Tesla’s price-to-earnings ratio is significantly higher than that of even its other mega-cap counterparts.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAnalysts on average now expect Tesla’s 2024 earnings to be about 40% lower than what they were estimating 12 months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the other six, the estimates have either risen over the same period or fallen very slightly.\\n\\nBullish investors on Tesla are “still looking out to mid-decade and not the current demand environment,” to focus on the next car, the self-driving technology and the humanoid robot Optimus among others, Cowen & Co. analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in an interview. He added that valuing such longer-term potentials are challenging given the current economic uncertainty.\\n\\n“I have a hard time being bullish on things beyond cars, especially technologies that don’t work yet and may never work, particularly the full-self-driving software,” Osborne added.\\n\\nThe cornerstone of Tesla’s valuation remains the EV business, where risks have been climbing fast. Rising interest rates have driven up car-ownership costs, squeezing consumers at a time of high inflation, and EVs being a new technology are suffering the most. Musk’s aggressive push to lower the price of Tesla’s cars hasn’t been seen to significantly boost demand.\\n\\nTesla’s lower-than-expected 2024 growth trajectory could be due to that broader slowdown in adoption, Deutsche Bank analysts Tim Rokossa and Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a recent note. The second wave of EV consumers may require a much cheaper starting price, and could be waiting for larger infrastructure — such as a charging network — to be built out.\\n\\n“Although US consumers will start benefiting from $7,500 in EV incentive credit at point of sale as of Jan. 1, we fear that this alone might not be sufficient to accelerate the demand curve in the US in the near term, especially given in a record high interest rate environment,” the analysts wrote in a client note on Tuesday.\\n\\nDespite that, believers in Tesla are keeping their faith in EVs’ longer-term potential, since most experts and analysts see electric cars as the future of the auto industry. And while competition to dominate that market will be intense, these investors are betting on Musk’s ability to keep the company ahead of the rest.\\n\\n“EVs have some big problems, but Tesla is way beyond just an EV company because of Elon Musk,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief investment officer and CEO at Tuttle Capital Management. “Elon allows for a higher multiple than you would have if Tesla was just an EV company.”\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nApple shares slipped 3.3% in premarket trading on Friday, on course to erase more than $90 billion from its market value, after the iPhone maker reported its fourth-quarter results. If losses hold, Apple would have a market cap of about $2.68 trillion — putting Microsoft Corp about $80 billion away from re-gaining the title of the world’s most valuable company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nApple Inc.’s disappointing holiday-quarter outlook has cast a spotlight on its mounting problems in China, where the iPhone maker is struggling with the unexpected rise of Huawei Technologies Co. and an increasingly hostile business environment. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of a massive fraud that led to the collapse of his FTX exchange, following a month-long trial that pitted the testimony of the former crypto king against that of some of his closest friends. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos said he was moving to Miami from the Seattle region, relocating to be closer to his parents and the Cape Canaveral operations of Blue Origin LLC, his space exploration company. Chinese electric truck maker Windrose Technology Inc. has started preparatory work for an initial public offering in the US next year as it plans the commercial roll out of its first vehicle. Nio Inc. said it is cutting jobs and and may spin off non-core businesses to reduce costs and improve efficiency, as the Chinese electric-vehicle maker falls way short of its sales targets and continues to post losses.\\n\\nEarnings Due Friday\\n\\nPremarket\\n\\nGartner Telus Liberty Broadband U.S. Cellular Telephone and Data Systems Inc Cinemark Shenandoah Telecom fuboTV AMC Networks\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess These Five Countries Are Key Economic ‘Connectors’ in a Fragmenting World World’s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season Foxconn Makes Your iPhone.

Its shares slid more than 3% after that number missed the average of five analysts’ projections by 11%. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook assured Wall Street that iPhone demand remains strong in China, blaming Mac and iPad weakness instead. But he also predicted flat December-quarter revenue, suggesting Wall Street won’t see the growth rebound it’s banking on.\\n\\nInvestors have grown skittish about the iPhone’s prospects in China, which accounts for about a fifth of Apple sales and hosts its biggest production base. The country’s consumer economy is reeling, while US businesses face increasing pressure from Beijing as a technology conflict with the US rages. Huawei’s surprise August debut of a smartphone with an advanced made-in-China 5G processor also tapped a vein of patriotism that’s taken sales away from the iPhone.\\n\\n“The challenges that Apple faces in China are unprecedented,” IDC analyst Will Wong said after the results. “It not only needs to deal with the political tensions and Huawei’s competition but also a different consumer sentiment that is more rational and cautious in spending.”\\n\\nApple’s revenue in Greater China declined 2% — a steeper drop than the companywide figure. There are signs that trend may persist: Initial sales of the iPhone 15 in China were 6% lower than its predecessor in part because of incursions by Huawei, according to the consultancy GfK.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAside from stronger competition, Apple faces growing risk from political tensions between Washington and Beijing.\\n\\nBeijing has expanded a ban on Apple products to state-backed firms and government-backed agencies. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. — which assembles the majority of Apple’s iPhones from its Chinese factories — is now under investigation over taxes and land use. Hon Hai, the listed arm of Foxconn Technology Group, and fellow iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. fell in Taipei on Friday.\\n\\nStill, Cook said the iPhone continues to make inroads in the world’s biggest smartphone market. Various models accounted for the four top-selling phones in urban China, he said.\\n\\n“China is an incredibly important market,” the CEO said during a post-earnings conference call with analysts. “And I’m very optimistic about it.” He didn’t face any direct questions about the situation.\\n\\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\\n\\nApple’s conference call did little to ease fears about a potential slowdown of product sales in China, which were notably below consensus at $15 billion, down 2.5% vs. last year, compared with expectations of a 10% increase. Services growth of 16% was the biggest positive surprise, helping to counter weak sales in China, and could be in double digits again in fiscal 1Q. Overall, these results and the 1Q outlook lead us to believe that fiscal 2024 sales growth will likely be about 2% lower than consensus of 5.6%.\\n\\n- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, BI analysts\\n\\nClick here for the full research\\n\\nThe iPhone 15 went on sale on Sept. 22 — only about a week before the quarter ended — so the latest results only provide an early sense of how the device is doing. Investors will get a clearer picture when Apple reports its holiday results early next year.\\n\\nIf the overall China smartphone market is contracting — as analysts have said — Apple’s results suggest that it’s winning market share, Cook said. He also touted that the company is opening a new store in the country this week. It’s coming to Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province and will be the company’s 46th in the region.\\n\\nCook was in China last month and said he “couldn’t be more excited” about the interactions he had with customers and employees, reiterating Apple’s commitment to manufacturing in the country.

However, the quarter will be one week shorter, denting sales by 7%.\\n\\nIn the September quarter, revenue at Apple\\'s key Chinese market dropped by 2.5%, exacerbating worries over the impact of intensifying competition and geopolitical tensions.

Sam Bankman-Fried convicted\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was found guilty of stealing billions of dollars from customers by a jury in New York on Thursday.\\n\\nThe decision, which came after just five hours of juror deliberation, means that 31-year old Bankman-Fried -- once considered to be an icon in the crypto industry -- may be sentenced to decades in prison. He had faced seven charges, including wire fraud and money laundering.\\n\\nHis sentencing date was set for March 28, 2024.\\n\\nSpeaking after the verdict, victorious U.S. prosecutors said that Bankman-Fried\\'s fraud aimed to position him as the \"king of crypto.\" They added that despite the relative youth of the crypto industry, \"this kind of corruption is as old as time.\"\\n\\nBankman-Fried\\'s lawyer noted that while he respects the jury\\'s decision, he will continue to \"vigorously\" fight the charges.\\n\\n5. Crude on course for losing week\\n\\nOil prices on Friday were on course for their second consecutive losing week, despite posting sharp gains in the previous session after traders became increasingly confident that the Fed was done with its run of interest rate hikes.\\n\\nBy 05:56 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $82.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract slipped by 0.2% to $86.72 per barrel.\\n\\nThe benchmarks gained more than $2 a barrel on Thursday.

And Apple shares declined more than 3% in late trading Thursday.\\n\\nBut the iPhone continued to make inroads in the market, Cook said.

On the call, Cook didn’t face any direct questions from analysts about the situation.\\n\\nThe issues are central to Apple’s business.

It just reported its fourth straight revenue decline, matching a streak it suffered in 2001, as the company struggles with a sluggish computer market and shaky demand in China.\\n\\nRevenue fell to $89.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30. That compared with an average Wall Street estimate of $89.4 billion. Apple didn’t provide formal guidance for the current quarter, sticking with a policy it adopted during the pandemic.\\n\\nThe results suggest that Apple is facing a deceleration in China. The government there has imposed bans on US technology in some workplaces, and a new phone from Huawei Technologies Co. is providing fresh competition. Revenue from that region amounted to $15.1 billion last quarter, down slightly from a year earlier and well short of the $17 billion that some analysts had predicted. Cook said the decline was due to a drop in Mac and iPad sales, as well as currency fluctuations.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple shares dropped as low as $169.33 in extended trading. They had closed at $177.57 in New York, leaving them up 37% this year.\\n\\nThe company updated the iPhone, its flagship product, during the fourth quarter. The period included a little over a week of sales data following the device’s launch on Sept. 22. The Cupertino, California-based company also released new watch models — the Series 9 and Ultra 2 — and updated its AirPods Pro to add a USB-C port.\\n\\nEven with the challenges, the iPhone performed slightly better than projected. It generated $43.8 billion in sales, compared with an average estimate of $43.7 billion. And, despite the concerns, the device reached a quarterly revenue record in mainland China, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the conference call with analysts. Earnings came in at $1.46 a share last quarter, topping the $1.39 forecast.\\n\\nCook also said the company was investing “quite a bit” in generative artificial intelligence. Bloomberg News recently reported that Apple is planning to inject the technology into several new apps and services next year. “You will see product advancements over time,” Cook said, “where those technologies are at the heart of them.”\\n\\nThe iPhone accounts for roughly half of Apple’s sales, so the launch of a new model is closely watched by investors. With the iPhone 15, the company redesigned the high-end versions — giving them titanium cases — and added features such as a more powerful zoom camera lens. The hope was to entice smartphone shoppers who had been holding onto their old models for longer these days.\\n\\nApple had a favorable year-over-year comparison this cycle because 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro models faced supply constraints due to shutdowns at Apple’s manufacturing partners in China. The iPhone 15 Pro had no such limitations.\\n\\nThursday’s report follows an upbeat view from Qualcomm Inc., the leading maker of smartphone chips. On Wednesday, it forecast stronger sales for the current quarter than analysts expected, kicking off a rally for its stock.\\n\\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\\n\\n“The sales miss in China is discouraging and could have been caused by soft consumer spending.”\\n\\n— Anurag Rana, BI technology industry analyst\\n\\nClick here to read his research.\\n\\nIn one potentially ominous sign, Qualcomm said that its smartphone chip business saw a 35% increase from Chinese manufacturers of Android phones, suggesting that customers in the region are opting for non-iPhones in larger numbers.\\n\\nThe area is Apple’s largest international market, accounting for about a fifth of sales. Still, Cook said he believes Apple actually gained smartphone market share in China during the quarter.\\n\\nThe company said that the iPhone set revenue records in several developed and emerging markets, including India.\\n\\nThe personal computer market also is poised for a resurgence, but Apple didn’t debut any new models during the quarter. Though it unveiled new MacBook Pros, iMacs and M3 processors earlier this week, sales of those machines won’t show up in Apple results until the quarter ending in December.\\n\\nApple brought in $7.61 billion from the Mac during the fourth quarter, missing forecasts of $8.76 billion. The company did release some new computers earlier this year, including a 15-inch MacBook Air and faster desktops. Apple blamed the steep decline on manufacturing challenges for the Mac last year. The company lost sales during the June quarter a year ago, only to regain them from pent-up demand in the September period. That set up a poor comparison for this year.\\n\\nRead More: Apple Unveils New Laptops, iMac and Trio of More Powerful Chips\\n\\nRevenue for the September quarter might have been stronger if the company had released new iPads during the period, which it sometimes does, or made more significant changes to its accessories. The latest Apple Watches and AirPods only represent modest tweaks from their predecessors.\\n\\nThe Wearables, Home and Accessories segment, which includes the watch, AirPods, Apple TV set-top box and Beats headphones, brought revenue of $9.32 billion. That fell short of the $9.41 billion estimate.\\n\\nThe services segment generated $22.3 billion in sales, beating Wall Street targets of $21.4 billion. That’s an all-time record for the category. The company is looking to make that business even more lucrative: It raised the prices for Apple TV+, Arcade and News+ last month, though that change was too recent to affect these results.\\n\\nThe iPad brought in revenue of $6.44 billion. Though that was a 10% decline from last year, it was better than the $6.12 billion projection. Apple hasn’t introduced a new iPad this calendar year, the first time that’s happened since the product first debuted in 2010. It did, however, release a cheaper Apple Pencil stylus for its tablets this week.\\n\\n(Updates with more commentary from conference call starting in 10th paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess World’s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors These Five Countries Are Key Economic ‘Connectors’ in a Fragmenting World Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season Foxconn Makes Your iPhone.

Just as it looked like the final trading months of 2023 were going to be more of the same tepid activity, we blast off +564 points on the Dow. It finished +1.7% on the session. The Nasdaq was up +232 points or +1.78%, while the S&P 500 gained +1.89%. The small-cap Russell 2000, still playing catch-up with its major index peers, jumped an excellent +2.69% today.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading up to a Fed meeting where interest rates were thought to not be increased, and then they weren’t, gave something of a relief rally to the proceedings. Worsening weekly and continuing jobless claims this morning actually helped justify the Fed’s decision to not raise rates, and perhaps most importantly of all — bond yield rates came down notably from their multi-year highs, with the 2-year back below 5% and the 10-year down to 4.663%. This has triggered a seemingly automatic re-attraction to the equities market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest company reporting earnings today is the biggest company in the world: Apple AAPL, which put out fiscal Q4 numbers after the closing bell today. Results were fine, but not the boffo figures we’d grown accustomed to over the years: earnings of $1.46 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus $1.39, and grew +13% year over year. Revenues of $89.5 billion surpassed the $89.03 billion expected, and swung to a profit year over year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for a company of Apple’s magnitude, with the new iPhone 15 having come out in the quarter, these numbers aren’t exactly hot (not nearly as hot as some of the phones were getting) — especially for a company trading at 26x forward earnings. Growth in the U.S. was OK, but not much in China. The company did set an all-time record for Services revenue and issued a 24-cent per share cash dividend, but shares have dropped about -1% in late trading.\\r\\n\\r\\nBooking Holdings BKNG, on the other hand, posted +36% earnings growth in its Q3 earnings this afternoon to $72.32 per share, on $7.3 billion in sales that outshone the Zacks consensus $7.23 billion and grew +21% year over year. The company saw “resilience in leisure/travel demand” in the quarter. However, the statement provided no guidance, and perhaps the reason we’re seeing a -6.6% drop in shares in the after-market is because we’re selling the news. Some investors were also looking for a stock split, and once again they did not get one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBooking rival Expedia EXPE reported record adjusted EBITDA up +13% to $1.2 billion in its Q3 report out after the bell, with earnings of $5.41 per share easily taking out the $5.15 expected, on $3.93 billion in revenues for the quarter which topped the $3.87 billion analysts were looking for. Shares are up +9% in late trading, likely to do with adjusting for its recent downtrodden value levels. Its One Key loyalty program reportedly brought good early results.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomorrow morning brings us the big Employment Situation report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We’re expecting to see around 170K new jobs filled for October — about half what the BLS reported the previous month — on an expected +3.8% Unemployment Rate. These are both historically good numbers, even if they pale in comparison to the previous month. Other employment metrics have depicted dwindling job adds across all sectors; we shall see if this is where we find ourselves tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Net income rose about 11%. Profit per share of $1.46 beat analyst expectations of $1.39 per share, according to LSEG.\\n\\nApple shares, which have risen 37% so far this year, closed up 2% on Thursday. They were down 1.3% in trading after the bell, having pared gains after the results were published.\\n\\nBut the results do not include the bulk of sales from Apple\\'s newest iPhone 15 models. Analysts and investors will be closely watching a conference call scheduled for 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) during which executives will give an outlook for the company\\'s all-important holiday sales quarter, historically the most important for the new devices.\\n\\nApple is facing tougher competition in the smartphone market this year as Huawei Technologies returns to the field with new phones powered by Chinese-made chips after being all but shut out of the market for several years by U.S. government trade curbs.\\n\\nApple\\'s sales in China fell 2.5% to $15.08 billion from $15.47 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that after accounting for foreign exchange rates, Apple\\'s business in China grew year-over-year, driven by iPhone sales and services revenue.\\n\\n\"In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for iPhone,\" Cook told Reuters. \"We had four out of the top five best-selling smartphones in urban China.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCook also said two of Apple\\'s new high-end handset models - the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max devices - are facing supply constraints.\\n\\n\"We\\'re working hard to manufacture more of them,\" he said. \"We do believe that later this quarter, we\\'ll reach a supply-demand balance.\"\\n\\nSeveral global trends are also playing in Apple\\'s favor, with forecasters predicting that the smartphone market has bottomed out and may start to recover in 2024.\\n\\nThe personal computer market is also expected to fare better in the coming year. Earlier this week, Apple rolled out new Mac machines.\\n\\nIn the longer term, investors are eying how Apple responds to the boom in generative artificial intelligence in which systems can follow prompts in human-like ways - an area that has attracted billions in spending by Microsoft and Alphabet\\'s Google. Apple has said it is working on the technology and views it as a way to improve a wide range of products.\\n\\nFor now, the iPhone remains Apple\\'s biggest seller. Sales of the device were $43.81 billion in the fourth quarter, in line with analyst expectations of $43.81 billion, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nSales in Apple\\'s wearables segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, fell 3% to $9.32 billion, short of estimates of $9.43 billion, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nApple has faced several quarters of declining sales of Macs and iPads, and the fourth quarter continued that trend. Mac sales slumped by a third to $7.61 billion and iPad sales declined 10% to $6.44 billion, compared with expectations of $8.63 billion and $6.07 billion, respectively, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nSales in Apple\\'s services segment, which includes Apple TV+ and which recently closed a deal with global soccer superstar Lionel Messi, rose 16% to $22.31 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $21.35 billion.\\n\\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Yuvraj Malik in BengaluruEditing by Sayantani Ghosh, Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-beats-quarterly-estimates-iphone-203156489.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.995, 'neg': 0.002, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.088}}, {'date': '2023-11-02T20:30:57+00:00', 'title': 'Apple earnings top estimates, iPhone sales notch September-quarter record', 'content': \"Apple (AAPL) reported earnings after the bell on Thursday that beat expectations and set another record for sales generated by its growing services business, though results showed total revenues declined for the fourth-straight quarter.\\n\\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.46 on revenue that reached $89.5 billion.

Warren Buffett Stocks Will Soar 88% to 242%', 'content': 'Warren Buffett is undeniably the greatest living investor. Since becoming chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) in 1965, he generated returns of 3.7 million percent for investors. That’s a near 20% annual return or twice that of the S&P 500 index.\\n\\nWhile partially a result of his buy-and-hold philosophy, the best Warren Buffett stocks are those with a simple, consumer-facing business that he bought at a good price. Allowing management do its thing and letting his winners run, the investing genius amassed a fortune for himself and his followers.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean sometimes his stocks don’t do poorly. But Buffett’s overarching themes for investing remain in place, and sometimes his stocks go on sale. It means patient investors can sometimes buy the same stocks as Buffett at prices even better than what he paid. And right now Wall Street says some of them are poised for liftoff.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe following three stocks are forecast by analysts to grow between 88% and 242% over the next year. While you can ride the coattails on these Warren Buffett stocks to profit, do your due diligence anyway. Even the Oracle of Omaha says he’s made mistakes with stocks he bought.\\n\\nUnited Parcel Services (UPS) United Parcel Service (UPS) truck on Interstate in the American West. UPS stock.\\n\\nSource: sladkozaponi / Shutterstock\\n\\nPackage delivery giant United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has been a part of Buffett’s portfolio since 2006. He paid on average around $75 per share. UPS never split its stock, but it has paid a dividend ever since going public. The carrier also increased the payout for 14 straight years. It currently yields 4.6% annually.\\n\\nThe stock was never a large holding in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. At its peak, he owned about 1.4 million shares. Today, though, Buffett only holds 59,400 shares. At the current price of $140 per share, that values his stake at $8.4 million. Not too shabby for mere mortals, but for Buffett it’s a paltry sum. UPS is the smallest position in the Berkshire portfolio.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhile you won’t be buying the stock at less than what Buffett did, it’s still worth considering. Wall Street has a high-end target price of $265 per share, which implies there is 88% upside in its stock over the next year.\\n\\nUPS business is a solid, steady grower. Although it often lagged behind the benchmark index, it still generated a 9% total return over the past 15 years. The stock dropped recently on a lower revenue outlook ahead of the peak holiday season, but that puts UPS at one of its lowest valuations in over a decade. It goes for 14 times trailing and estimated earnings while the dividend yield is at its highest point, save for during the pandemic.\\n\\nDon’t expect UPS stock to become a rocket, but for a “steady Eddie” stock for your portfolio, the package delivery expert will perform admirably over time.\\n\\nBank of America (BAC) The logo of Bank of America (BAC) in modern office building in Beverly Hills, California\\n\\nSource: Tero Vesalainen/Shutterstock\\n\\nGoing from least to most, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is the biggest stock holding in Buffett’s portfolio on a shares-owned basis. Berkshire Hathaway owns over 1 billion shares of the bank, putting its valuation at $27.2 billion. That’s second only to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\\n\\nThe stock is down 20% year-to-date after investor confidence in the banking system was shaken following the collapse of several high-profile financial institutions earlier this year. However, Buffett never wavered on Bank of America. Even as he sold off other financial stocks, he held firm with this bank.\\n\\nAfter excoriating the way most banks operate, Buffett told shareholders he remained cautious about owning bank stocks, but “we do remain with one bank…I like Bank of America and I like the management.”\\n\\nWall Street is just as confident in its future. Analysts see as much as 108% upside in the stock with a high-end price target of $55 per share. There’s good reason for the exuberance. Although high interest rates are weighing heavily on consumers, Bank of America exceeded earnings and revenue estimates due to increased interest income as a result of higher borrowing costs. More consumers are using their credit cards, lifting average loan and lease balances. It’s an indictment of current economic conditions, but a silver lining of sorts for investors.\\n\\nBank of America is trading at severely discounted valuations, including at just a fraction of its book value. The market still views its earnings growth suspiciously, but that will turn eventually. Buying now will reward you handsomely later on.\\n\\nParamount Global (PARA) PARA stock: the Paramount plus logo on a phone in front of a screen displaying various Paramount TV shows and movies\\n\\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\\n\\nAdmittedly Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) isn’t a stock Buffett has expressed the greatest confidence in. He told CNBC, “It isn’t fundamentally that good of a business.” He said the movie studio’s decision to slash its dividend was “not good news.” And he’s worried about Paramount’s future in the streaming business because higher prices are needed but that’s incompatible with retaining viewers.\\n\\nStill, Buffett maintains a significant holding of Paramount stock, some 93.7 million shares worth over $1 billion. It’s equivalent to a 15% stake in the entertainment company. Analysts are especially exuberant about where its price can go. They have a $37 per share high-side price target on the stock, which means Wall Street expects to see shares nearly quadruple in value.\\n\\nThe stock trades at less than 10 times earnings estimates and a miniscule fraction of its sales. Still it’s a tough business that will likely see more fallout from providers. The ongoing Hollywood strike isn’t helping business and theaters are ailing. Although Buffett owns a good chunk of the company and Wall Street seems enamored with the stock, Paramount Global isn’t one that I’d be rushing to buy.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A perfect example happened not long ago, when PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)\\xa0stock\\xa0dropped even though there wasn’t any terrible news about the company. This is fine, though, as it just opened up a window of opportunity for value seekers to invest in PayPal.\\n\\nGranted, there is some uncertainty surrounding PayPal’s\\xa0CEO transition and competition in the payments space from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Regarding the first point, PayPal’s investors need to be patient, as executive-level transitions take some time and the anxiety will pass. As for Apple, I’ll explain how PayPal and Apple are actually working together to make payments easier for customers.\\n\\nPYPL Stock Slides Into the Buy Zone\\n\\nIt’s been frustrating, no doubt, for investors to watch PYPL stock to decline since February. However, there’s no need to lose faith. If you liked the stock at $87 in February, then you should like it even more at its current price.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nAfter all, the data suggests that PayPal’s valuation is quite reasonable. The company’s trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.4x is substantially lower than PayPal’s five-year average P/E ratio of 53.58x.\\n\\nA specific event, which wasn’t precipitated by PayPal, prompted some panic and caused the PYPL stock price to fall recently — but I’ll get to that in a moment. First, I wanted to point out that even if PayPal and Apple are competitors in some ways, they’re also working together.\\n\\nHere’s the rundown. Reportedly, PayPal’s customers can now add “eligible PayPal and Venmo credit or debit cards\\xa0to Apple Wallet“. There’s a convenience factor here as PayPal and Venmo users can make payments via an iPhone or Apple Watch.\\n\\nFurthermore, PayPal and Venmo users who added their cards to Apple Wallet can then use Apple Pay on an iPhone, an iPad or a Mac. It just goes to show that rivals in the payments space, like PayPal and Apple, can serve customers better and create a win-win situation by working together.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFright in France Puts Pressure on PayPal\\n\\nSo, here’s the event that prompted fear on Wall Street about fintech companies like PayPal. After hearing this, you may be shocked at how irrational and panicky some financial traders can be.\\n\\nOn Oct. 25, Visa (NYSE:V) reported quarterly results indicating robust international travel and cross-border payments volume. Yet, the U.S. stock market decided to ignore this green flag.\\n\\nInstead, they focused on Worldline, a French payments company that’s not even listed on a major U.S. stock exchange. Worldline released its financial results the same day that Visa did, and slashed its full-year financial guidance.\\n\\nWorldline stock dropped 59% in Paris, and the company warned investors about the challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe and especially in Germany. Among the ripple effects was a selloff in U.S. payment stocks, including PYPL stock.\\n\\nDaniel O’Regan, a managing director at Mizuho Secuirites, attributed the share-price decline to “a few things.” These included\\xa0the “continued Worldline hangover, fear of more consumer slowing” and “competitive threats from Apple as it gets bigger in the buy-now-pay later space.”\\n\\nAs I’ve explained, I believe there’s room for PayPal and Apple to coexist and even collaborate to the benefit of the customers. Moreover, Visa’s results paint a different, less bleak picture of the international payments space.\\n\\nMizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev wrote that the U.S. stock reaction to the Worldline warning was overblown. I tend to concur, and I feel it’s irrational for the market to punish PayPal, which doesn’t generate most of its revenue from Europe.\\n\\nPYPL Stock: Buy the Dips and Hold On for Years\\n\\nIt’s a positive sign that Apple is willing to work with PayPal. Sure, they’ll continue to compete, but the two companies can also complement each other in some ways.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Worldline warning shouldn’t scare PayPal’s investors into panic-selling their shares. PayPal has survived international challenges before. Plus, the company’s CEO transition is a temporary concern. In the long run, the new leadership could bring new growth opportunities to PayPal.\\n\\nSo, don’t let the headlines in the financial press frighten you. PayPal\\xa0is here to stay, and now is a great time to buy PYPL stock. It’s trading substantially below its February peak price, so feel free to buy some PayPal shares while they’re still cheap.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\\xa0Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

If you find them, you could be positioned to ride the next leg up as automation, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and more unstoppable trends begin their next leg up. Ultimately, look to one of two things. First, find semiconductor stocks with a niche end item (like a specific part of electric vehicle assemblies, for example). These companies typically dominate their market and are unshakable from that position.\\n\\nAlternately, look to companies leveraging widespread tech utilization. Semiconductors are an integral part of daily life, and we don’t usually know it. Some companies make components for hundreds of products you interact with daily. These companies spread their risk across many sub-sectors and industries, which also serves to ensure longevity.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nInfineon (IFNNY) AI.

This European company specializes in semiconductor manufacturing. Its components are part of many applications, including powering essential vehicle components such as infotainment systems, dashboards, and more.\\n\\nInfineon’s semiconductors also play a crucial role in less glamorous but vital EV features like anti-lock brake systems, airbag deployment mechanisms, and air conditioning. As EVs evolve into increasingly higher-end automotives (due to R&D costs reducing manufacturing expenses), demand for these semiconductors will skyrocket. Infineon is one of the few chip manufacturers ideally positioned to capitalize on this growing demand.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBeyond simply safety features, the EV infotainment system outlook is especially strong. According to a research report, the demand for EV infotainment systems is expected to see an annual growth of 38% through 2030. As vehicle internals become increasingly intricate, semiconductor demand follows suit. Infineon’s unique position within this niche of the EV value chain sets it apart from broad, niche-use semiconductor stocks.\\n\\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it. Semiconductor stocks to sell\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a bigger-picture semiconductor stock focusing efforts on a range of “big data” computing solutions, including edge and cloud computing. At the same time, its core products span across end items ranging from televisions to laptops. This market penetration ensures Lattice’s staying power and recent financials point to strength for this overlooked semiconductor company.\\n\\nAcross the board, LSCC improved its financial standing in this week’s earnings report. Revenue expanded 11% year-over-year. LSCC adapted to cost-cutting initiatives and expanded its gross margin. Likewise, the company’s free cash flow jumped 40% and management executed the twelfth consecutive quarter of share buybacks. Despite the great news, shares fell off a cliff after earnings, posting a net 35% loss over October. What gives?\\n\\nIn a word, demand slowed slightly. AI/ML enthusiasm reached a fever pitch, and, critically, consumers are slashing spending. This means that, generally, the firms with an AI advantage have sufficient computing power to continue for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nAt the same time, consumer sentiment slowing means LSCC’s peripheral products like televisions are sitting on shelves. Of course, the upcoming holiday season could mark a trend reversal. Still, LSCC’s strong financial position means it can withstand a few periods of flat sales growth. At the same time, its expansive portfolio ensures longevity in a competitive industry.\\n\\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\\n\\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is another niche semiconductor stock with deep market penetration. SWKS services wireless companies. Its semiconductors are vital to the overall wireless ecosystem, and they’re found in cell towers and individual user phones alike. SWKS stands to specifically gain from increased 5G network connectivity, as its components assist in band switching and other technical traits associated with 5G.\\n\\nBeyond its broad market opportunity, SWKS is entrenched with industry juggernauts like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to whom SWKS owes nearly 60% of its 2022 revenue. Of course, reliance on a single source isn’t ideal. But the broad 5G market is set to grow 32% annually through 2030, cushioning SWKS’ precarious reliance on Apple’s whims.\\n\\nInstitutional investors see something in SWKS and own 84% of the company’s total shares. As the saying goes, “Follow the smart money.” Massive institutional giants are the definition of smart money. With 19 companies holding more than half the float, they’re staking much of their financial future on SWKS’ success – pointing to the fact that there’s something special about this semiconductor stock.\\n\\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Wisekey (WKEY) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nWisekey (NASDAQ:WKEY) is a penny stock, a rare trait among semiconductor stocks. But this diversified tech stock, which provides cybersecurity solutions and Internet of Things integration, increasingly relies on its semiconductor sector as “strategic premium revenue” in the United States. That semiconductor segment exploded 38% in the most recent report, marking an important milestone as (like we saw with SWKS) general demand falls.\\n\\nNotably, WKEY also serves as a space stock play alongside its semiconductor status. The company enjoys a strategic partnership with Elon Musk’s brainchild, SpaceX, to launch and maintain a series of satellites. Those satellites reinforce WKEY’s Internet of Things paradigm, offering greater device connectivity and faster execution times.\\n\\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) a close up image of a semiconductor\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nOnto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) is technically a semiconductor support stock but one vital to the overall industry. The support stock is still riding the AI wave, and its year-to-date surge of 65% isn’t the end of this hardware company’s story.\\n\\nIn August, the company unveiled a massive $100 million deal for its Dragonfly inspection system. This hardware plays a pivotal role in identifying flaws and defects in third-party semiconductors, a critical operational concern for companies like Nvidia.\\n\\nOnto holds a firmly established position within the semiconductor supply chain based on that inspection requirement, making it a key semiconductor stock. Onto’s services cater to a diverse range of customers, given that chips have become an integral component in most electronic systems.\\n\\nAs AI demand grows, the existing GPU and tech stack market, currently valued at $3.16 billion, will expand to $25.5 billion by 2030. As companies strive to lead the charge in the semiconductor “space race”, Onto stands in the prime position to capitalize on this trend, irrespective of the ultimate victor.\\n\\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Microchip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\\n\\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) is deeply embedded in your daily life, whether you know it or not. The semiconductor stock makes a range of control systems ranging from garage door openers to chip readers. If there’s a theme for this list, MCHP embodies semiconductor stock potential: these components are increasingly entrenched in our daily lives. To that end, investors looking for semiconductor stocks to buy need to target those that link us with everyday objects in a way we don’t even consider as we go about our business.\\n\\nA recent report highlights this thesis. Analysts detailed that the electroluminescent driver market, of which MCHP is a key component, will explode over the next few years. Never heard of the electroluminescent driver market? Me neither, but you interact with it daily.\\n\\nLaptops, cell phones, internal car light systems, and more – all leverage that market and integrate MCHP semiconductor products when doing so. Morningstar pegs MCHP’s fair value 30% above its current share price. That seems reasonable, considering MCHP’s far-reaching market penetration (even if you haven’t heard of many of its core offerings!).\\n\\nFabrinet (FN) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN), our final semiconductor stock, is like ONTO because it serves a supporting role in the semiconductor industry. But that role, like ONTO’s, is massive.\\n\\nFabrinet specializes in standardized electronic and technical component manufacturing. Those components are, in turn, used by companies to assemble their final products. This is akin to how automobile manufacturers, for instance, outsource the production of components like doors before assembling the complete vehicle in their facilities.\\n\\nHowever, in Fabrinet’s case, it manufactures optical communication components and advanced lasers for companies such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which happens to be their largest revenue-generating customer.\\n\\nBut beyond their core blue-chip clientele, experts see how semiconductor sectors and AI enthusiasm can push Fabrinet to the stratosphere. Following a robust earnings report, analysts have raised the consensus price target for Fabrinet to $165, largely due to their promising AI-related opportunities. FN stock popped nearly 40% since that collective upgrade, but shares remain below the price target.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Nvidia constitutes 13% of Fabrinet’s revenue, and other AI-focused data communications companies are increasingly drawn to the company. Similar to Onto Innovation, Fabrinet’s components play a critical role in fueling the growth and expansion of AI markets.\\n\\nImportantly, the success of both these companies is not dependent on the specific winners in today’s competitive AI landscape. They stand to benefit from the broader trend, regardless of which companies ultimately emerge as victors or face challenges in the AI race.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Analysts say this could impact a number of industries and change long-term consumer habits. Here are the top things investors need to know.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>1. Preliminary forecasts (00:00:31)</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Everything from food and beverage to medical devices, insulin, and bariatric surgery – are all estimated to see slower revenues due to GLP-1 use. The drugs could eventually impact industries like snack and beverages, restaurants, tobacco, gaming, apparel, food, and retail, according to Bank of America (<a data-i13n=\\\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\\\">BAC</a>) analysts.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>2. Consumer staples (00:00:52)</strong></p>\\\\n<p>While prescriptions are regulated, it hasn’t stopped people from getting access – especially if they are willing to shell out the annual $15,000 out of pocket. Combined with other headwinds, the S&P Consumer Staples Index is down 3% year-to-date, compared to the 8% gain the larger index enjoyed.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>3. Food and beverage (00:01:10)</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Companies like Hershey (<a data-i13n=\\\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HSY?p=HSY&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\\\">HSY</a>), PepsiCo (<a data-i13n=\\\\\"cpos:6;pos:1\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP?p=PEP&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\\\">PEP</a>), and Coca-Cola (<a data-i13n=\\\\\"cpos:7;pos:1\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO?p=KO&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\\\">KO</a>) have already been diversifying their portfolios to cater to shifting consumer needs, introducing zero calorie options and smaller sizes.

Medical devices and pharmaceuticals (00:01:54)</strong></p>\\\\n<p>The popularity of the drugs has put pressure on bariatric surgery, which has seen a slight slowdown since the start of the year. Medical devices like insulin pumps and glucose monitoring devices have not been impacted by the drugs, despite analyst predictions.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>5. Current market (00:02:08)</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Despite being used by a little over 1% of the U.S. population, the drugs have seen record demand this year. Analysts say sales of Lilly’s Mounjaro, which is still only approved to treat diabetes, are already on a $4 billion run rate. And the popularity of Ozempic briefly made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe last month. Currently, Mounjaro has 23% of the overall weight loss market, while Ozempic occupies a 42% share.</p>\\\\n<p>Yahoo Finance\\'s <a data-i13n=\\\\\"cpos:12;pos:1\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/anjalee-khemlani/?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\\\">Anjalee Khemlani</a> says that the drugs have been \\\\\"really spectacular at providing record weight loss.\\\\\" Khemlani added, \\\\\"Ozempic really taking the lead there with $3.1 billion alone for the last quarter.

(00:02:56)</strong></p>\\\\n<p>So what does this all mean? Well, the reality is the long-term implications of these weight loss drugs are largely unknown.

Why is its trial being held in secret?\", 'content': 'Google: Maker of the best search engine, or just the most popular? (Jeff Chiu / Associated Press)\\n\\nThe public has been riveted for weeks by the most important federal trial for the tech world in a quarter-century.\\n\\nThe criminal trial of accused cryptocurrency scam artist Sam Bankman-Fried, right?\\n\\nNo, not that. We\\'re talking about U.S. vs. Google, a massive antitrust trial unfolding in a federal courtroom in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nGoogle is their first choice based on legitimate considerations of quality and price. It should be sufficient to say that the antitrust laws do not exist to punish a successful competitor or hold an umbrella over less-efficient rivals.\\n\\nGoogle explains why it thinks customers choose its search engine\\n\\nFunny thing about that, however. No one is paying much attention to that case for a couple of reasons. To begin with, the arguments on both sides are mind-numbingly technical, seeking to establish whether the deals in which Google is alleged to have cemented its search engine into Apple computers and iPhones and Android smartphones — to such a degree that no other search engine has a prayer of gaining ground — are illegal.\\n\\nBut there\\'s another, vastly more important reason. Largely at Google\\'s behest, Judge Amit P. Mehta has conducted much of the trial behind closed doors.\\n\\nSince the nonjury trial began Sept. 12 — it\\'s expected to continue for as much as several more weeks — he has allowed hundreds of crucial documents and countless hours of testimony to be submitted and conducted in secret.\\n\\nMehta also refused to allow audio transmission of the proceedings. (Google asserted in court that an audio feed would only be exploited for \"clickbait.\")\\n\\nAnd with limited exceptions, the judge turned away pleas by news organizations to open more of the proceedings to public view. In September, he ruled that litigants \"may\" post trial exhibits online. But according to a motion filed Oct. 16 by the New York Times, since he didn\\'t say they \"must\" do so, since that ruling \"none of the parties has provided consistent access to exhibits used in open court.\" (Emphasis in the original.)\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, Google — or Alphabet, its parent company — has already won a significant victory in this case. Even if the judge rules against the company, it has managed to keep crucial information about how it conducts its business out of the public eye.\\n\\nRead more:Column: Yes, Amazon is a near-monopoly. Dismantling it will be harder than you think\\n\\nThis situation underscores one of the chief failings of the American legal system: It often functions as a private playground for rich litigants.\\n\\nWealthy criminal defendants can exploit the bail system to stay out of jail in advance of their trials, while poorer defendants who can\\'t raise the necessary cash spend pretrial months in stir.\\n\\nWith the connivance of federal judges who wish to keep their dockets pared down, big corporations force aggrieved consumers and workers into arbitration, where the latter are at a disadvantage.\\n\\nAnd now this, where a company worth $1.6 trillion can defend its dominance of a huge high-tech landscape while letting the public know only what it wants them to know. Want to know what\\'s in this document filed in the Google antitrust trial? Tough. (U.S. v Google)\\n\\nThe experience of Microsoft, the last big tech company to face an antitrust prosecution of this magnitude, illustrates what a boon the secrecy is for Alphabet. The earlier case concluded in 2001 with a trial judge\\'s ruling that Microsoft had illegally monopolized the market for computer operating systems. He ordered the company broken up.\\n\\nAn appeals court overturned the breakup order. The government and Microsoft reached a settlement paring back the company\\'s ability to impose anticompetitive restrictions on computer makers. But Microsoft\\'s reputation took a hit from the public\\'s view of its bare-knuckle tactics and its efforts to gull the court with allegedly falsified evidence.\\n\\n\"One result,\" observes consumer advocate Matt Stoller, \"was that Microsoft, afraid of public exposure years later, refused to use its control over the browser to kill nascent rivals, in particular a young search company called Google.\"\\n\\nThe dwindling cadre of reporters following the trial have to do so in person. They get almost no advance warning of when they\\'ll be barred from the courtroom for the day. They just have to turn up to find out.\\n\\nOne important witness, former Google executive John Giannandrea, testified in open court for ten minutes on Sept. 21. Then the press and public were excluded and he continued his testimony in secret for another four hours.\\n\\nGoogle doesn\\'t deserve all the blame for this secrecy. The government hasn\\'t protested the company\\'s demands to seal documents and testimony — the Department of Justice did post some evidentiary filings online, until the judge ordered that it wait for his approval before doing so again.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s partners in some of the business arrangements the government plaintiffs are challenging, including Apple, have also asked to keep testimony involving them confidential. The judge has generally agreed.\\n\\nRead more:Column: That big Albertsons-Kroger merger will enrich millionaire insiders at your expense\\n\\nDecisions to close a trial from public view, in any event, belong to the judges, and they\\'re expected to do so only in special cases. Mehta, however, has been criticized for allowing Google effectively to dictate when material falls into the exclusionary category of trade secrets.\\n\\n“I’m a trial judge,\" he said at a pretrial conference this summer. \"And so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it’s going to cause competitive harm.\"\\n\\nThat brings us to the nuts and bolts of the case. It was initially brought by the Department of Justice in 2020, during the Trump administration, and was eventually consolidated with a similar case brought by several red states that were then campaigning against Big Tech for purportedly discriminating against conservative voices. The plaintiffs\\' cadre has greatly expanded, with the addition of 15 blue states, including California.\\n\\nThe main allegation concerns how Google established itself as the default search engine on Apple devices, web browsers such as Opera and Mozilla, and smartphones made by LG, Motorola and Samsung with contracts and financial blandishments that essentially closed off the search market to competitors.\\n\\nNot even the resurgent Microsoft has been able to breach the wall for the benefit of its search engine Bing, which is mired at about 7% of the search market against Google\\'s estimated 88%. Bing\\'s share is so meager that specialized search providers — think Open Table and TripAdvisor — \"have little interest in working with Microsoft, except, perhaps, as an after-thought,\" according to the plaintiffs\\' pretrial brief.\\n\\n\"Because our reliance on Google has actually only increased,\" an unidentified representative of one of those providers testified, \"Bing ... is kind of not relevant anymore. It has been pushed out.”\\n\\nRead more:Column: Biden could remake American society by reviving antitrust enforcement\\n\\nThe plaintiffs say that Google achieved its dominance partially by relying on the power of the default in guiding consumer behavior. Put simply: Humans being creatures of habit, the vast majority of phone and computer users will stick with the first app pushed at them in any category.\\n\\nConsequently, Google had made great efforts to become the default search engine on all those devices, making lucrative deals with Apple and the other manufacturers to place its search engine on home pages and browsers. To this day, users of Apple\\'s Safari browser search the web with Google unless they take deliberate steps to choose an alternative.\\n\\nEven now, a government lawyer said on the first day of trial, Google spends $10 billion a year to ensure that its search engine remains the default on devices of all kinds. Efforts by competitors to dislodge it have invariably fallen short. In 2018, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified, his company was even willing to drop the \"Bing\" name from its search engine brand if that would enable it to secure a default slot from Apple. It didn\\'t work.\\n\\nThe technical arguments raised at the trial turn on whether Google\\'s arrangements with the device and browser companies are \"exclusive\" — if so, that would strengthen the plaintiffs\\' position that the company engaged in illegal anticompetitive conduct.\\n\\nGoogle says in its defense that there\\'s nothing exclusive about these deals. All its partners are free to offer users alternative choices — the contracts merely make Google the default.\\n\\nUsers of Apple\\'s Safari, for example, can reconfigure their browser to use Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia by choosing them from a drop-down menu. Nothing keeps iPhone or smartphone users from installing a widget for any other search engine on their home screen or home page.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s position is that users are making a free choice on the merits. \"Google is their first choice based on legitimate considerations of quality and price,\" it says in its court filings. \"It should be sufficient to say that the antitrust laws do not exist to punish a successful competitor or hold an umbrella over less-efficient rivals.\"\\n\\nRead more:Column: This government price-fixing case makes the tuna industry sound like the mafia\\n\\nEven a government witness, economist Michael Whinston of MIT, acknowledged that if all Android smartphone users were given a free choice of search engines upon acquiring their phones, \"Google would be selected more than 90% of the time,\" as Mehta described his testimony. Whinston estimated the \"shift\" from Google to other search engines would only be \"approximately 1% of all search queries in the U.S.”\\n\\nYet that could merely reflect the dominance of Google in consumers\\' minds, as evidenced by the evolution of the brand name into a generic term for web searching.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs contend that the ability of users to choose an alternative to Google search is nothing but a smokescreen obscuring its powerful dominance. Given Google\\'s position, they say, “a monopolist could enter into any contract — no matter its effects on competition — so long as one rival existed and made some feeble attempt to secure the business.\" The dominant firm would only continue to get stronger until \"it had managed to wipe out all vestiges of present or future competition.”\\n\\nThere\\'s something to that. Anyone who has tried to change the default search engine on Apple\\'s Safari to something other than Google knows that it\\'s not an intuitive process. Nothing on the Safari screen tells the user even where to go to make the choice; you just have to know.\\n\\n(As a service to readers, on a Mac it\\'s done by navigating to the Safari tab at the top of the computer screen, choosing \"Preferences,\" then going to the \"Search\" tab and finding the options on the drop-down menu. On an iPhone you have to go to the \"Settings\" icon, scroll down and click on \"Safari,\" then click on \"Search Engine.\" Simple, isn\\'t it? No wonder no one ever does it.)\\n\\nI\\'m not an Android user, so for those devices you\\'re on your own. I\\'m sure you can Google it.\\n\\nWhatever happens in this trial, it will happen at a pace that makes an adagio tempo feel like an all-out sprint. The judge isn\\'t expected to rule until early next year; if he rules against Google, another proceeding will then have to be held to ponder remedies. In the meantime, there will be no getting away from Google or its fellow Alphabet apps, including Gmail, the Chrome browser, Google Play, Google Books and more than I can even count.\\n\\nIs this good for us as individuals or for our society? Despite their ubiquity, not all these apps are the best available. Chrome is slow, a memory hog, and has been known to snarf up users\\' private search data for the company\\'s purposes. Google search itself has been compromised by the deals its owner has made to steer users to websites belonging to the company\\'s corporate partners. As I asked back in 2012, after the Federal Communications Commission called it out for privacy violations, \"Has Google become too big to trust?\"\\n\\nTo ask the question is to answer it, but in case that’s not explicit enough, the answer plainly is yes.\\n\\nMore competition might well drive the company to address these shortcomings for fear of losing users to rivals. But it doesn\\'t have any competition to speak of. So we\\'re living in Google\\'s world, crossing our fingers in the hopes that the company will live up to its original slogan, \"Don\\'t be evil.\"\\n\\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\\r\\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\\r\\nSign me up.\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-googles-dominance-affects-us-100017811.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.994, 'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.068}}, {'date': '2023-11-02T09:30:00+00:00', 'title': \"Proportion of India-made iPhones to double by 2024 while Foxconn's output in China to shrink, TF Securities analyst says\", 'content': 'India will continue to rise as an iPhone production base in the coming years while Foxconn\\'s production of the Apple smartphone in China could shrink significantly, according to a research report.\\n\\nThe proportion of India-made iPhones, which account for 12 to 14 per cent of global shipments in 2023, is expected to reach 20 to 25 per cent of the total next year if production expansion goes smoothly, Kuo Ming-chi, a TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate assessment of Apple\\'s business, wrote in a note on Wednesday.\\n\\nApple\\'s major supplier Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, currently operates 75 to 80 per cent of the iPhone production capacity in India, according to Kuo\\'s report.\\n\\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The chip company reported adjusted earnings of $2.02 per share versus estimates of $1.92. Revenue of $8.67 billion was better than the expected $8.51 billion. Fiscal fourth-quarter guidance was also better than expected.\\n\\nQualcomm\\'s CEO, Cristiano Amon, spoke with Yahoo Finance last week while at the company\\'s Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, having a positive attitude on the company\\'s new chip product and future performance against competitors like Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC).\\n\\nAngelo Zino, CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Qualcomm\\'s latest quarterly earnings and how the company has a great opportunity to step in the ring with its competitors in the PC market.\\n\\n\"When you look at how far they\\'ve [Apple] pushed the limits in terms of their silicon chip that they just launched this week, based on 3-nanometer technology, it is still ahead,\" Zino says. \"We think of the Qualcomm\\'s of the world, which just kind of launched based on their 4-nanometer technology, with that said, it is absolutely an opportunity for Qualcomm, it\\'s also going to be an opportunity for a name like Nvidia, which probably gets into the CPU PC market in 2025. \"\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\n- And Angelo, we did have-- the company came out unveiled that new PC chip, and we had the CEO on Yahoo Finance, he was talking very tough there about-- listen, he can outperform Apple, he can outperform Intel. Maybe not near-term, but let\\'s say intermediate long-term. Do you see that as a tailwind for the company?\\n\\nANGELO ZINO: Listen, I think it\\'s an opportunity for them. I mean, whether it be getting into PCs or other markets where they\\'re not really deeply entrenched in. I think it\\'s definitely an opportunity, where there is kind of new revenue opportunities for them. Now that being said, you look at what Intel has said about ARM-based chips into the PC market. They don\\'t necessarily believe it.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut when you think about what Apple has done on the ARM-based side of things, dumping Intel and how successful they\\'ve been kind of taking share here over the last two to three years, it\\'s been pretty impressive. Now, Apple, of course, is Apple. And when you kind look at how far they\\'ve pushed the limits in terms of their M3 silicon chip that they just launched this week based on 3-nanometer technology, it is still ahead. We think of the Qualcomm\\'s of the world, which just kind of launched based on their 4-nanometer technology.\\n\\nBut that said, it is absolutely an opportunity for Qualcomm it\\'s also going to be an opportunity for a name like NVIDIA, which probably gets into the CPU PC market in 2025, so they\\'re going to be other opportunities out there for companies that haven\\'t had the opportunity on the side of things because it has been dominated by x86 Architecture, specifically by Intel.\\n\\nSo an opportunity, whether or not it transitions too much I think, again, remains to be seen and probably is going to take a couple of years before you see notable kind of revenue potential.\\n\\n- Angelo, you mentioned Apple, and I would be remiss if I didn\\'t ask about it. I mean, obviously Qualcomm is a little bit of an unusual indicator when it comes to Apple because it\\'s both a client of and competitor too at this stage. But what\\'s the read through if any from Qualcomm to what we\\'re going to hear from Apple?\\n\\nANGELO ZINO: I wouldn\\'t read too much into it. I mean, we\\'ve learned that in the past, right? I mean, you kind look at just the last quarter results, and Qualcomm took a big beating, and Apple actually did fairly well. So I don\\'t know if I\\'d look too much into it. But that said, you know I do think you\\'re seeing a stabilization in terms of the broader smartphone market out there.\\n\\nThey\\'re probably going to see some challenges, clearly on the China side of things. And we clearly want to know a lot about what Apple has to say about China tomorrow night. But nonetheless, I mean, it\\'s a good sign that the broader market in terms of smartphones is stabilizing. It\\'ll be important to see what Qualcomm on this call has to say, if anything, about the Android versus kind of the iOS ecosystem out there.\\n\\nMy guess is some of the uplift or a good amount of the uplift is coming on the Android side of things because it\\'s been so beaten down. But nonetheless, I think it\\'s definitely promising to see a stabilization within the smartphone side of things.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/qualcomm-big-opportunity-pc-market-211708228.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'INL.F', 'INL.XETRA', 'INTC.MX', 'INTC.US', 'ITLC34.SA', 'QCI.F', 'QCI.XETRA', 'QCOM.MX', 'QCOM.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.119}}, {'date': '2023-11-01T21:12:06+00:00', 'title': 'Apple earnings, Jamie Dimon interview: What to Watch', 'content': 'Yahoo Finance Live anchor Josh Lipton looks ahead to the earnings results due out from Apple (AAPL), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Paramount (PARA).\\n\\nHe also previews Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi’s exclusive interview with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon airing live at 6:00 P.M.

Apple and Nvidia in Focus', 'content': 'What should investors make of this year’s third-quarter earnings? The Q3 results have been pretty good, with 78% of companies reporting so far beating the forecasts, but stocks are still feeling pressure. One obvious sign of that pressure: the S&P 500 this week hit its lowest point since last May, and is just shy of correction territory.\\n\\nThe effect is most clearly seen in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ a group of Big Tech giants whose gains earlier in the year carried the markets generally – but which are facing serious losses lately, despite solid earnings results. Four of these tech giants – Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft – have reported earnings so far, and all beat expectations. The group as a whole is expected to show a 33% year-over-year increase in profits this earnings season. Even so, the Magnificent Seven stocks are down 11% since the end of July.\\n\\nBut does this mean you shouldn’t buy in? Wall Street’s analysts are weighing in on that question, especially relevant with both Apple and Nvidia scheduled to release earnings in the near future. These are iconic names, leaders in their respective industries, and they have proven records of long-term success. Let’s put them into focus ahead of their upcoming financial releases to see where they stand now and why some analysts are recommending ‘Buy’ ahead of the earnings results.\\n\\nDon’t miss\\n\\nNuclear Power Is the Future — and These Stocks Are Leading the Charge J.P. Morgan Sees at Least 60% Gains in These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks —\\xa0Here’s Why They Could Soar ‘Buy the Dip’: Analysts Say These 2 Beaten-Down Stocks Offer a Compelling Entry Point —\\xa0Here’s Why They Could Rebound\\n\\nApple(AAPL)\\n\\nWe’ll start with a company that needs little introduction: Apple. Apple’s $2.67 trillion market cap makes it the largest publicly traded firm in the world. The company is best known for its iconic products, including the iPhone line, iPads, and MacBook computers. Apple’s success was built on its reputation for high-end quality and the professional-level applications that the Mac computer lines could support. In recent years, the company has been expanding its service segment.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple has also been working to integrate AI technology into its user experience. The company has used it to improve the autocorrect feature on its iPhone line and is using AI to create a smarter AirPod, making an earbud that will recognize when the user is having a conversation and automatically lower the volume.\\n\\nSmall tweaks have kept the product lines popular with consumers, and Apple weathered a serious industry-wide drop in smartphone sales earlier this year. Industry research showed that smartphone shipments fell 24% in 1H23, but Apple saw only a 6% decline in iPhone sales. By the end of the half, Apple held a 55% market share in smartphones.\\n\\nIn its last reported quarter, fiscal 3Q23, which ended on July 1, Apple posted revenues of $81.8 billion, marking a 1% year-over-year loss, and earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, indicating a 5% year-over-year gain. These results were considered positive, especially in light of the overall decline in smartphone sales. The company also reported having more than 1 billion paid subscription customers, driving its Services segment to record revenues. Looking forward, the Street expects Apple to report $89.4 billion in revenue and $1.39 in earnings per share when it reports its fiscal Q4 financial results on November 2.\\n\\nCovering Apple for Morgan Stanley, analyst Erik Woodring writes of the upcoming earnings, “We expect Apple to post an in-line to better than expected September quarter (F4Q23), highlighted by MSD Y/Y iPhone revenue growth, accelerating Services growth, and record gross margins. However, we are more cautious on the December quarter (F1Q24) given iPhone supply shortages and uneven consumer spending, and believe Apple will guide to a revenue range that is both below normal seasonality and Consensus expectations. Looking at the rest of the mega cap tech names that reported this earnings season, the companies that have guided to December quarter profitability in excess of Consensus have seen greater post-earnings outperformance than those guiding closer (or below) to Consensus, and therefore we lean cautiously into earnings on Thursday.”\\n\\nEven though he is somewhat cautious, Woodring goes on to give an upbeat bottom line: “However, with the potential for iPhone upside later in the quarter (if supply improves; akin to the iPhone 13 cycle) and/or a better than seasonal March quarter, Services growth accelerating, and shares near what we believe is a near-term floor (of $160), we are bullish over the next 12 months.”\\n\\nThe analyst’s stance supports his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares, and his $210 price target implies a gain of nearly 23% for AAPL over the next 12 months. (Watch Woodring’s track record)\\n\\nOverall, the analyst consensus on Apple is a Moderate Buy, based on 31 recent reviews that break down to 22 Buys and 9 Holds. The shares are selling for $171.40 right now, and their $203.35 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of ~19%. (See Apple stock forecast)\\n\\nNvidia Corporation(NVDA)\\n\\nNext up is Nvidia, a leader in the global semiconductor chip industry – and another of the stock market’s handful of trillion-dollar-plus companies. Nvidia has built its dominance around high demand for its top-end GPU chips, which were originally developed for high-end gaming apps but have found strong market share with professional graphic designers and AI developers as well. The launch of ChatGPT last November, and the subsequent boom in AI, opened up even more opportunities for Nvidia.\\n\\nProminent among those opportunities was the announcement from ChatGPT’s creator, OpenAI, that it will need as many as 10,000 new GPU chips in the coming year in order to maintain current performance levels of the popular chatbot. Nvidia is already a leading supplier for the Microsoft-backed company, and now looks at 2024 from the happy vantage point of having a satisfied high-volume customer.\\n\\nIt’s not just AI that’s powering Nvidia’s growth. The company saw more than $10 billion in data center revenue, as customers went all-in on the company’s high-end, advanced computing chips. This accounted for the majority of Nvidia’s $13.5 billion revenue in fiscal 2Q24, surpassing expectations by $2.43 billion. The firm’s non-GAAP EPS figure, of $2.70, was 61 cents ahead of the forecasts. Looking ahead to the company’s upcoming fiscal 3Q24 release, the expectations are for continued growth – revenue of $15.99 billion, and earnings of $3.37 per share.\\n\\nFor 5-star analyst Ambrish Srivastava, writing from BMO, all of this adds up to a bullish picture for the long term. Srivastava says of Nvidia, “We believe as a company NVIDIA is likely experiencing the best visibility it has ever had. NVIDIA highlighted that its visibility for data center is backed by purchase orders, which are required for allocation requests from customers given supply constraints, with customers with large commitments likely getting priority… NVIDIA appears confident in its ability to secure supply into next year, both on the CoWoS side for the more complete GPU solutions, as well on the networking side, particularly in infiniband.”\\n\\nLooking ahead, the analyst, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 3% of the Wall Street stock pros, lays out a clear path for Nvidia in the near-term: “NVIDIA sees a very large addressable TAM ($1T installed base of data center infrastructure), with the company today addressing a single-digit percentage of the annual data center spend. NVIDIA sees a long-term tailwind of the installed base from general purpose CPUs to accelerated computing and generative AI.”\\n\\nSrivastava quantifies his outlook on Nvidia with an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and a price target which, at $600, points toward a robust 47% gain in the coming year. (Watch Srivastava’s track record)\\n\\nOverall, Nvidia has a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street, supported by 38 analyst reviews with a lopsided split of 37 Buys to 1 Hold. The stock is priced at $407.80 – and its $645.53 average target price suggests an appreciation of 55% on the one-year horizon.

The stocks now trade at an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 30 times compared with 45 times in mid-June.\\n\\nSome market participants see an opportunity. Shares of the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvdia, Meta Plaforms and Tesla - have soared over the last decade, and now many are drawing investors with rock-solid balance sheets that many believe can weather rocky economic times.\\n\\n“They are the highest quality names out there and, frankly, if we do go into a recession next year ... I actually think the Magnificent Seven will hold up better,” said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management.\\n\\nBecause the Magnificent Seven have a combined weighting of 28% in the S&P 500, their performance holds a large sway over the broader index. The S&P 500 has fallen 9% from its 2023 high reached in late July, though it is still up just over 9% year-to-date.\\n\\nLip said his firm owns shares of all seven companies and has recently added to its holdings in some of them.\\n\\nOthers have been buying as well. Tech stocks saw $2 billion of net inflows last week, their largest in about two months, analysts at BofA Global Research said in a report. Data from Vanda Research showed retail investors’ net buys of nine big tech and growth stocks reached 31% of total flows, after being below 30% for most of the month.\\n\\nWhether the dip buyers are right will hinge in part on the trajectory of Treasury yields, which have risen to 16-year highs on fiscal worries and expectations that the Federal Reserve will need to keep interest rates higher for longer in order to decisively defeat inflation. The Fed will conclude its latest monetary policy meeting on Wednesday.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHigher yields increase the cost of capital for businesses and households, while also making government bonds a more attractive alternative to equities. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield has risen about 100 basis points since late July as stocks have come under pressure.\\n\\nAnother important test will come on Thursday when Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, reports results. Shares of several megacap companies have been hit hard by negative reactions to their earnings reports, including those of Google parent Alphabet, Tesla and Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, because interest rates are high and we have a war in the Middle East, pretty good is just not good enough,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO of InfraCap. \"The bar is extraordinarily high to have a real beat.\"\\n\\nKim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, which holds Apple shares, said she was looking for insight into the extent of potential saturation of the smartphone market and the willingness of consumers to buy the next iPhone model.\\n\\n\"They are the phone provider of choice for the developed world,” Forrest said, adding: \"As goes Apple, so goes the S&P, just because of its weighting.”\\n\\nApple’s shares, which alone have a weighting of over 7% in the S&P 500, are up 31% year-to-date.\\n\\nSome investors are differentiating among the seven. Hatfield prefers Nvidia and Microsoft as companies that have the most leverage to artificial intelligence trends.\\n\\nThomas Ognar, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global, said the Dynamic Growth Equity team\\'s portfolios at Allspring are overweight Amazon and Meta. Both companies are showing bottom-line benefits from cost controls, while Amazon\\'s cloud computing business may have already bottomed and Meta is showing improvements in areas such as short-form videos, Ognar said.\\n\\nAs a group, the Magnificent 7 still show common traits that have supported their share outperformance, including being massive collectors of data, Ognar said.\\n\\n\"You can see that they have had some competitive advantages which they have been utilizing and I think have been on display this year, which is why the stocks have done well,” Ognar said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-wavering-magnificent-seven-draw-134320708.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GSPC.INDX'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.136}}, {'date': '2023-11-01T13:21:40+00:00', 'title': \"The 'Magnificent Seven' stock market leaders went their separate ways in October\", 'content': 'The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants that have led the 2023 stock market rally saw their fortunes diverge in October as earnings, industry narratives, and investor fatigue worked through this group of leaders.\\n\\n\"At this point you can\\'t look at them as seven stocks together,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday.\\n\\nLast month, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) were the only members of the group to post gains greater than 1% with the Seattle-area giants rising 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively.

Apple (AAPL) stock logged a similarly lackluster month, falling 0.3% after a more than 8% drop in September; the iPhone maker will report results on Thursday.\\n\\nValuations come under scrutiny\\n\\nThe diverging paths for these names also reflect broader themes weighing on stocks this earnings season.\\n\\nThe bar to please investors when discussing AI has shifted. Both Microsoft and Amazon passed that test, while investors felt \"too much AI benefit\" might\\'ve been embedded into Alphabet\\'s stock, according to Jefferies tech analyst Brent Thill.\\n\\nTesla, which has at times been swept up in the AI narrative on the back of self-driving ambitions, has had more near-term concerns like slimming margins and the prospects of its Cybertruck launch catching investor attention.\\n\\nStory continues Tesla\\'s Cybertruck is displayed at Manhattan\\'s Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2021.

In fact, since 2016 the number of youngsters starting apprenticeships has fallen sharply by 31% in England, according to the CIPD’s new report.\\n\\nThis was particularly acute among small businesses, where the number of apprentices enrolling declined by 49%, compared to just a 14% drop in large firms with 250 or more employees.\\n\\nWhat’s more, while Gen Zers are shunning apprenticeships, millennials are still eyeing up vocational training in order to enter management without the high price tag of an MBA.\\n\\nAccording to the research, the majority of apprentices across the U.K. who started in 2022 were over 25 years old, with the majority of them taking up a “higher apprenticeship”—the most advanced qualification offered—in business, administration, and law.\\n\\nIn Scotland specifically, the number of new apprentices in their late twenties has doubled since 2019.\\n\\nDegrees are no longer the apple of employer’s eyes\\n\\nThe uptick in apprenticeship schemes came as degrees fell out of favor with employers.\\n\\nGoogle, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple have all eliminated their long-held degree requirements for jobs to remove barriers to entry and recruit more diverse talent. Meanwhile, recruiters globally are five times more likely to search for new hires by skills over higher education.\\n\\nSimilarly, Cisco\\'s top executive in the U.K. doesn\\'t have a college degree and doesn\\'t think young aspiring workers need one either.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"I never did anything academically beyond my GCSEs [exams taken at 16 in the U.K.] and never went to university,\" David Meads Cisco\\'s U.K. and Ireland CEO recently told Fortune. \"But you can fast forward 40 years and here I am.\"\\n\\n“In university, you come out with whatever degree you may get, but it’s almost certainly saddled with debt,” he added. “Is that better than on-the-job experience where you’re rotating through different parts of our organization, and living the reality and not just the theory?”\\n\\nHe’s not the first CEO to praise skipping out on college to join the world of work as soon as possible.\\n\\nRichard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin, has repeatedly urged young people to ditch university in favor of the “school of life”.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has echoed that there is a “mismatch between the skills that are coming out of colleges and what the skills are that we believe we need in the future.” It’s why, he said aspiring coders in particular don’t need a degree to be successful, at the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting.\\n\\nEven when looking at the Fortune 500, the CEOs of five top 20 companies, including Costco CEO W.

The company operated out of a bland, two-story building bristling with security cameras. Engineers interviewing for jobs there weren’t even told what they’d be working on. Once new hires made their way into the lab, however, they learned that they would be trying to revolutionize diabetes care.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nImmigrants Are Leaving Canada at Faster Pace, Study Shows Israel Latest: Blinken Returning to Israel; Refugee Camp Hit Real Estate Industry Takes Fresh Hit With Verdict on Commissions Saudi Forces on Alert After Clash With Iran-Backed Houthis Sony’s Bungie Game Unit Cut 8% of Staff After ‘Destiny’ Play Wilted\\n\\nAvolonte wasn’t just any health-care company. It was a project of Apple Inc., and its mission came directly from Steve Jobs. Apple’s co-founder and then-chief executive officer, ill with the pancreatic cancer that would take his life near the end of that year, had tasked a group of his key executives to develop a noninvasive blood sugar monitor. It would be a potentially life-changing technology for diabetics, who would no longer need to prick themselves to monitor their blood glucose. Medical device makers had tried for years to develop something like it. Even Alphabet Inc. experimented unsuccessfully with using special contact lenses to measure the glucose in tears.\\n\\nFour years after the quiet arrival of Avolonte, Tim Cook stood in the same packed auditorium where his predecessor, Jobs, had unveiled the original Macintosh and introduced the Apple Watch. Cook called it the “next chapter in Apple’s story.” The new device boasted health features: a heart rate monitor, a way to measure steps taken and calories burned and a fitness app for tracking workouts. But the original vision had been grander. The company had envisioned the watch as a tiny medical lab, featuring the Avolonte glucose monitor as a centerpiece.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nToday there remains a sense — both inside Apple and in the broader world of public health — of unfulfilled potential. The company’s effort to weave health monitoring and disease prevention into its bestselling devices has yielded breakthroughs, but the strategy has also been short-circuited by philosophical disagreements, a culture of conservatism and technological realities. Apple has scrapped or slowed work on a broad range of promising projects, frustrating some of the doctors and engineers it hired to work on them. The details, much of which have never been reported before, are based on interviews with numerous people involved in the company’s health initiatives who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to discuss the work.\\n\\nEven setting aside the formidable technical challenges, health care is a different beast from consumer electronics and telecommunications, two sectors that Apple has successfully disrupted but which only very rarely deal with death and disease. “The things that they’re trying to do are not easy,” said Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, but the company has said its work remains early.\\n\\nOnce just a bullet point, health and fitness are now key to how Apple sells the watch. The latest model includes a thermometer to measure body temperature for fertility planning, a sensor to measure blood oxygen levels, algorithms to track sleep and a system to perform electrocardiograms. The company has also turned the iPhone into a fitness tracker and has given it the ability to tap into hospital records. Apple has touted stories of its products saving lives by alerting users to deadly heart conditions and automatically calling emergency services for people who have hurt themselves in falls or car crashes.\\n\\nApple’s efforts have helped bring health tracking into the mainstream. It has an enticing road map for 2024, including hypertension and sleep apnea detection for the watch and hearing aid capabilities for AirPods. There are plans to turn its forthcoming Vision Pro headset into a health and fitness device, too. And work continues on a paid health coach service that uses artificial intelligence.\\n\\n“Health is a world of opportunity to help people,” said Bob Mansfield, the company’s former chief of hardware engineering who helped create the company’s health and smartwatch efforts. The Apple Watch’s “ability to play a key role in health was one of the things that excited us most about building it in the first place,” he told Bloomberg. “Compared to today, the earliest technologies built in weren’t very good. It is exciting for me to see how this idea has and continues to develop.”\\n\\nIn Apple’s ideal future, people will need fewer single-function medical devices like blood pressure checkers and thermometers, fewer blood draws and fewer visits to the doctor. Cook has said that improving health will prove to be his company’s “greatest contribution to mankind.” That future could be very lucrative for the company: The health and fitness tracker market is rapidly growing, with some projecting it will become a nearly $200 billion-a-year industry within a decade.\\n\\nThe late essayist Susan Sontag famously wrote, “Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick.” Apple, by focusing on prevention, has preferred to stay in the kingdom of the well. Its core market is what’s known in industry parlance as the “worried well,” those of us anxiously trying to decipher our body’s signals for evidence that something is wrong. That makes a certain amount of sense for a consumer electronics company. Moving into curing or even caring for diseases would entangle the company in a web of different countries’ regulatory regimes and present hard questions about business models. But taking them on might also mean more lives saved. And that is a recurring tension within the company.\\n\\n“The main takeaway from their whole strategy is that they shy away from the actual care,” said Adrian Aoun, the founder and CEO of Forward, a company that runs a chain of high-tech in-person and remote clinics. Apple is building “awesome technologies,” but they’re “skating around the problem,” he said. “Health care is messy, and you have to get your hands dirty,” he said. “At some point you have to be ready to draw blood.”\\n\\nIn the early 2010s, Apple began hiring health consultants, medical device experts and sleep scientists. It hired sensor mavens from places like Medtronic Plc with expertise across every metric Apple wanted its smartwatch to handle. Avolonte was the stealthiest initiative. The group was ostensibly separate from its parent company, allowing it to source components and conduct human trials without generating publicity, according to people with knowledge of the effort.\\n\\nOnly Apple’s most senior executives were aware of what was taking place in the office 15 minutes from headquarters. Avolonte was not listed in any official Apple system, and employees were barred from bringing Apple apparel into the vicinity. Staffers donned badges with an Avolonte logo (an “A” crossed with an infinity symbol, a nod to the address of Apple’s old headquarters, on a private road called Infinite Loop). And when Cook would visit the office for a status update, he’d arrive in a baseball cap, pulled low to avoid detection.\\n\\nA few years and hundreds of millions of dollars into the project, Avolonte researchers settled on a technology called short-wave infrared absorption spectroscopy. This technique involves shining lasers through the skin into the interstitial fluid between the blood vessels and the cells they serve. The intensity of the light’s reflection back, researchers have found, can be used to calculate the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid and, by extension, in the bloodstream — and the only thing that has had to penetrate the body is light.\\n\\nStill, Apple had a ways to go before producing a market-ready sensor. A noninvasive system needs to see through a wide range of skin tones and analyze various blood types. It would also have to work indefinitely, unlike sensor patches like the FreeStyle Libre on shelves now, which prick the skin and need to be frequently replaced. And Apple’s planned system calls for the use of AI to sift the raw data and generate a prediction for when a person may become diabetic.\\n\\nAs Apple prepared to introduce the watch in 2014, it became clear that the glucose sensor would not make it in. Nor would the blood pressure, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram capabilities the company was trying to develop. There were component sourcing issues, battery and reliability concerns and the very real problem of cramming them into the tight quarters of a device that is less than 2 inches by 2 inches.\\n\\nFaced with these limitations, Apple decided it made little sense to market the watch primarily as a health device. Instead, it was positioned as a bling-y tech accessory for managing incoming calls and texts, tracking fitness and, of course, telling the time. The then-design chief, Jony Ive, legendary for helping Jobs hone Apple’s austerely luxurious aesthetic, prodded the company into offering $17,000 watch variants made from rose gold. Apple somewhat downplayed the heart rate monitor on the first version of the device because of the sensor’s initially limited performance.\\n\\nSince then, Apple has worked to increase the health capabilities of the watch, believing that a fitness device could be a major new business that wouldn’t cannibalize the iPhone. The glucose monitor project has continued, in secrecy, at a cost in the high tens of millions of dollars a year. As Apple reevaluated its operations when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it decided to bring the project onto its own campus. It’s now led by Apple’s Exploratory Design Group, or XDG, a secretive team in the chip design division. The work was recently taken over by one of Apple’s top Mac and iPhone chip executives, but, according to people with knowledge of the efforts, it’s still unlikely to show up in a product for at least a few years.\\n\\nOther key projects were nixed during development. Apple investigated building a nutrition tracker into its Health app and looked into selling a suite of peripherals for the Apple Watch, including a bathroom scale and an Ive-designed blood pressure cuff that didn’t need to inflate. The company prototyped watch straps with sensors that gather data from the underside of the wrist and researched both a bed-mounted sleep tracker and a nightstand device with sensors to monitor users overnight before pushing the technology into the watch itself.\\n\\nFor a time, Apple engineers were also deeply engaged in an effort to make the watch and Health app compatible with the billions of Android devices in circulation. The move, codenamed Project Fennel, would have brought the company’s health features — and the health benefits Apple has repeatedly underlined — to many more people, especially in countries where Apple has little market share. But other business considerations prevailed: The work was nearly complete when Project Fennel was canceled, in part because the Apple Watch is a driver of iPhone sales. “If you gave up the watch to Android, you would dilute the value of the watch to the iPhone,” said someone with knowledge of the decision.\\n\\nPrototypes and projects that don’t make it to market are commonplace in the tech world. However, some of those working on the new technologies have chafed at the cautious nature of Apple’s efforts. They say company engineers and doctors have long had to contend with fears from top executives that a poor medical experience with Apple could tarnish the perception of the company. “Tim and Jeff are so terrified of doing something wrong and are focused on protecting the company’s image,” one person said, referring to Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who is responsible for the company’s health work. Other people with knowledge of the health team also attribute the cautiousness to privacy requirements and to the difficulty of gathering viable health data from the wrist.\\n\\nThat mix of trepidation and ambition shapes some of the new features the company is rolling out. The planned addition of a blood pressure sensor to the Apple Watch next year is a pathbreaking technology. In its first iteration, however, the system is designed to just tell a user if their blood pressure is trending upward and to offer a journal for the user to jot down what was happening when hypertension occurred. To avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the feature will then direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements. A future version of the system is in the works with an ability to provide exact numbers — and even diagnose related conditions. But those enhancements remain far off.\\n\\nThe blood glucose system may operate similarly at first. During development, it’s been designed to monitor how a person’s blood sugar is trending and warn users of prediabetes, rather than offer an actual blood sugar reading. “Apple is going after nanotechnology and software,” a person involved in the work said. “That’s what we are very good at. What we’re not interested in is post-sick health care.”\\n\\nThe distinction between health and health care defines much of what Apple will be doing for the foreseeable future. Early considerations for the virtual health and fitness coach include the ability to generate eating, sleeping and exercise recommendations from data collected from Apple devices, according to people with knowledge of its development. There are concepts, too, for tapping into device cameras to track and correct users’ form while they’re exercising, similar to a feature offered on Peloton Interactive Inc.’s TV-connected workout device. If all goes according to plan, AirPods by next year will be able to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid and be able to perform the hearing tests typically administered in audiologists’ offices.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple is laying the groundwork to turn the Vision Pro headset into a health device. The company is working on new anti-anxiety and enhanced meditation features for the product and on a virtual-reality system to reinforce positive thinking and improve mental health. Apple has also been studying using the sensors in the device to scan a wearer’s eyes for cognitive health data. A headset version of Fitness+, Apple’s workout video subscription, remains on the table, with the company trying to perfect a full-body tracking system that would allow the headset to decipher a person’s leg movements during workouts. This would further put the $3,500 product in competition with Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest, which already lets people exercise in a virtual environment.\\n\\nAlso on the map for 2024 is a watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. It will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition. It will then direct users to see a physician.\\n\\nStill, there are some signs that the company is exploring capabilities that would verge on treatment. Right now its pulse oximeter sensor will only show a person their blood oxygen percentage, not what the data means. The current version of the app makes this clear, telling users: “Blood Oxygen measurements are not intended for medical use.” The company is considering seeking health regulatory approval that would allow it to interpret the data for consumers. Apple also wants to expand the watch’s thermometer so it can sense a fever, not just power its fertility tracking feature. And, last year, it launched AFib History, a feature that lets people with the condition track how long they are in a state of atrial fibrillation.\\n\\nApple has explored various business models for the watch, including one inspired by a practice that had worked for the company in the past. In the early days of the iPhone, Apple sold the devices to consumers at a discount, getting wireless carriers to cover the rest. Apple got paid full value, while the carriers were able to lock in consumers to long-term contracts for phone service. With its watch, Apple explored a similar arrangement: Health insurers would cover much or all of the price of the Apple Watch, hook consumers on their insurance plans and ultimately pay out less to doctors because the Apple health features would keep customers out of the hospital. Over the past several years, Apple has reached agreements with Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealthcare, but a number of other insurers turned down Apple’s overtures, believing it would take too long to turn a profit on their investment.\\n\\nUnlike health-care leaders at some other technology companies, Williams is an engineering and operations expert, not a doctor. Much of Apple’s health strategy, therefore, is led by Sumbul Desai, a physician turned health-care executive who was recruited by Williams in 2017 to come to Apple and manage its employee health clinics. Desai came from Stanford University, where she served as the associate chief medical officer and led a push into so-called digital-first primary care at the school’s health-care system.\\n\\nApple had ambitions of building something similar. The concept, known within the company as Infinite Health, was for Apple to push into consumer medical care, building clinics across major cities and even within its retail stores, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The clinics would feature the open spaces and clean lines of an Apple retail store and sleek equipment like the non-inflating blood-pressure cuff. Apple-employed doctors there would review data collected from the company’s devices and fill in the gaps with standardized equipment.\\n\\nSome people at Apple envisioned the clinics as a way for the company to reinvent health care in the same way it revolutionized music players and phones. Apple even held acquisition talks with Crossover Health, which ran the onsite clinics where Apple employees could get care at work, as well as with the chain One Medical, which Amazon.com Inc. would buy for nearly $4 billion in 2023. “What Amazon is doing now,” said a person who worked on the project, “is what we were really hoping we could do in an Apple-like way.”\\n\\nWilliams pitched the consumer clinics idea to Cook many years ago, but the duo ultimately landed on a compromise: taking over the infrastructure and technology of the existing Apple employee clinics. The idea was to turn a corporate perk into a kind of health-care innovation lab and, in Silicon Valley vernacular, ask employees to eat the same dog food they were considering selling to their customers. “The thought process was, if we can’t ship something good enough for our employees, no consumer will want this thing,” said a person involved in the work. “It was a bit of a dogfooding exercise.”\\n\\nThe dog food, however, was not great. The clinics in Silicon Valley, eventually relaunched by Desai under the name AC Wellness, provide adequate care, but they’re extremely expensive to run. “There’s no way any consumer or employer would ever pay what it takes Apple to run the clinics,” said a person involved in their creation, given the high costs of the devices, salaries and the backend services to power the offering. “It’s probably fine for a population of young and healthy employees, but you wouldn’t want to run a Medicare Advantage plan with it,” said someone else with knowledge of the clinics. Still, the broader Infinite Health concept for consumer clinics hasn’t been completely abandoned.\\n\\nAnother dogfooding exercise was an app called HealthHabit, where users could chat with a care coordinator and then, if necessary, be routed to a medical professional. Doctors could answer simple questions such as, “Should I take Advil for a hurt knee?” but the service couldn’t offer much in the way of new prescriptions or diagnoses. At the peak of its internal testing, HealthHabit only had about 3,500 users, out of a population of many tens of thousands at Apple offices in Silicon Valley. “This was the first real go at how you can have a physician in the loop during health care from Apple, and it was such a failure, it killed the vision,” said a person involved in its development. Apple canceled an expansion to employees in Texas, and the app never made it to consumers. The company eventually repurposed some of the work for a new internal tool.\\n\\nAccording to multiple people who worked on that and other health initiatives, part of the problem has been the health team’s leadership. One physician in the group, upon leaving at the end of 2019, sent a scathing email to Cook and Williams reviewed by Bloomberg that describes a workplace characterized by “authoritarian rule through intimidation and fierce retribution for not marching in line.” In addition to complaints like these, physicians have criticized executives for offering up erroneous medical information in meetings and then upbraiding colleagues who contradicted them.\\n\\nAt a product event in September, the company didn’t make as much noise as usual about health. It released a mental health feature for the iPhone and Apple Watch that allows a user to log how they are feeling throughout the day and a mechanism that warns users against holding their devices too close to their eyes for long periods of time.\\n\\nIn a sense, the fate of the blood glucose sensor will be a sign of how willing the company is to move beyond the worried well into the kingdom of the sick. Some involved in Apple’s health efforts don’t believe the company will leverage its future blood sugar checker on the Apple Watch as a medical device for people who already have diabetes — because of regulatory concerns and technology limitations that could create the risk of giving a patient an incorrect result.\\n\\nStill, senior executives and board members at the company point out that preventing millions of people from getting diabetes in the first place is an enormous accomplishment. “The goal is not only to fix the prick problem,” said someone who has been briefed on the work by one of its leaders, “but to change the global problem of diabetes.” Apple, in other words, is still thinking big. —With Ike Swetlitz\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nWorld’s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors How Drug Cartels Transformed Ecuador Into a ‘Narco State’ Is This Poop-Test Startup Just Wellness Theater?

With that being said, investors will certainly be hoping these iconic tech partners can post strong quarterly results that give both of their stocks a boost. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nQualcomm Q4 Preview\\n\\nSlowing growth centered around a stalling recovery in China amid stiffer regulations from the Chinese government has derailed Qualcomm’s stock in 2023.\\n\\nHowever, at current levels, Qualcomm’s valuation has become attractive despite Q4 earnings projected at $1.92 a share compared to $3.31 per share a year ago. Fourth-quarter sales are forecasted at $8.55 billion versus $11.40 billion in Q4 2022.\\n\\nThe Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) does indicate Qualcomm could top earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q4 EPS at $2.02 per share and 5% above the Zacks Consensus. Plus, Qualcomm has surpassed earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports most recently topping the Zacks Consensus for Q3 EPS by 3%. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nApple Q4 Preview\\n\\nApple has faced regulation scrutiny in China as well although this is expected to have a milder impact on its top and bottom lines. To that point, Apple’s Q4 earnings are forecasted to be up 8% year over year at $1.39 per share. This is despite Q4 sales projected to dip -1% to $88.79 billion.\\n\\nMore intriguing, Apple’s Greater China segment sales are anticipated at $17.34 billion which would be a 12% increase from Q4 2022. Apple has also surpassed earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports most recently beating the Zacks Consensus for Q3 EPS by 6%.\\n\\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nOutlook & Current Valuations\\n\\nOverall, Qualcomm’s earnings are forecasted to drop -33% in fiscal 2023 at $8.32 per share compared to $12.53 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rebound and rise 9% to $9.11 per share. On the top line, sales are projected to dip -19% this year but stabilize and rise 3% in FY24 to $36.94 billion.\\n\\nNotably, Qualcomm's stock trades at 11.8X forward earnings which is nicely below the S&P 500’s 19.5X. This is also 67% below its decade-long high of 36.9X and a 28% discount to the median of 16.5X.

First, the amount of dividend payout and the dividend yield the blue-chip stock is delivering. Further, the visibility for capital gains to estimate the total returns from the stock in the long term.\\n\\nI would also look at the company’s growth outlook. Large companies won’t offer a stellar growth trajectory. However, even consistent 5% to 10% growth will impact valuation and cash flows. Since we are focused on dividends, an upside in cash flows will provide clear dividend growth visibility.\\n\\nGrowth is important to consider because we live in an inflationary environment. Dividend-seeking investors must ensure the dividend stock portfolio provides continued upside in regular cash flows.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThese dividend stocks for long-term growth are trading at attractive valuations.\\n\\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J Super Hercules of the United States Air Force performing at Aero India 2017.\\n\\nSource: Joe Ravi / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nGlobal defense spending increased for the eighth consecutive year in 2022 to $2.24 trillion. Even during the pandemic, defense spending increased. Considering the geopolitical scenario globally, it makes complete sense to invest in defense stocks for growth. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is my top pick among long-term dividend stocks to buy.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that LMT stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.3, the stock looks poised for a breakout rally. Further, a dividend yield of 2.84% is attractive, and I expect healthy dividend growth.\\n\\nMy view is underscored by Lockheed’s strong order backlog of $156 billion. This provides clear cash flow visibility, and for the year, Lockheed has guided a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. With order intake remaining strong, I expect revenue growth to accelerate coupled with cash flow upside. This will ensure increased shareholder rewards in dividends and share repurchases.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\\n\\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock might have disappointed investors in the last 12 months. However, the sell-off is overdone, and PFE stock trades at a valuation gap. A dividend yield of 5.45% is also attractive, and I expect high total returns from the stock in the next few years.\\n\\nWith COVID-19 vaccine sales declining, the stock has corrected. There are also concerns related to the impact on growth as drugs go off-patent in the coming years. However, Pfizer is working on boosting growth through two strategies.\\n\\nFirst, the company is investing heavily in research and development and already has a deep pipeline. Pfizer expects incremental revenue of $20 billion from new molecular entities by 2030.\\n\\nFurther, Pfizer has been exploring and aggressively pursuing acquisitions. The company expects new business development to contribute $25 billion in incremental revenue by 2030.\\n\\nWith sound financial flexibility, I am optimistic about PFE stock trending higher from oversold levels. At the same time, dividends are sustainable, and there is potential for growth as the company aggressively boosts revenues.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on building\\n\\nSource: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a value creator over the years. I will not be surprised if Apple is the first to command a valuation of $10 trillion in the coming years. Currently, a dividend yield of 0.57% does not sound attractive. I am, however, optimistic about robust dividend growth until 2030.\\n\\nFrom a financial perspective, Apple’s services revenue touched an all-time high in Q3 2023. This was driven by over one billion in paid subscriptions. Further, operating cash flow for the first nine months 2023 was $89 billion. Robust cash flow ensures that the company can invest heavily in research and development. At the same time, there is ample flexibility to increase dividends and allocation toward share repurchase.\\n\\nThe key growth catalyst is that Apple is at the forefront of innovation. Recently, the company set a target to invest $1 billion annually toward artificial intelligence products. There are speculations that Apple will launch its electric car in 2026 with a price tag under $100,000. With diversification-driven growth, the company will be well positioned to continue creating value.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler co-head of technology research, cloud apps, and analytics joins us now. So, Brent, take us through what about this makes it the iPhone moment for Microsoft.\\n\\nBRENT BRACELIN: Sure. So if you think about the mobile movement and the smartphone movement, rarely-- excuse me, rarely do you see the largest companies actually monetize that opportunity. We're at basically this juncture point here with generative AI, a new AI technology where Microsoft has a first mover advantage. It's the largest software company, one of the largest tech companies in the world. They actually have a first mover advantage. So similar to iPhone and the opportunity that that brought for Apple, we see a similar opportunity where Microsoft, specifically with 365 Copilot, can really change the future of work.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-first-mover-advantage-365-160837017.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.946, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.93, 'pos': 0.07}}, {'date': '2023-10-31T15:43:05+00:00', 'title': 'Stocks on track for downbeat end to volatile October', 'content': \"The final trading day of October is here, and the month appears to be ending on a less-than-stellar note for the Dow (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC).

Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple has shed about 13% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 12.1%. The trend might reverse if the company’s earnings beat estimates in the soon-to-be-reported quarter (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC and iShares US Technology ETF IYW have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\\n\\nInside Our Methodology\\n\\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.13% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.81% in the trailing four quarters. The tech titan is expected to report the fourth consecutive decline in revenues that could spread fears of pessimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year growth of 7.75% for earnings and a decline of 1.5% for revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 21%) and has a solid Growth Score of B. Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.64 a month ago based on 29 recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 29 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 58.62% and 10.34% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 62.07%, while Buy represented 10.34% (read: 5 Inverse Tech ETFs That Rose on Nasdaq Entry Into Correction).\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 26 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.46. The forecasts range from a low of $140.00 to a high of $240.00.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat to Watch\\n\\nOn the last earnings call, the tech giant expected fiscal fourth-quarter year-over-year revenues to be “down,” similar to the third quarter.

Apple notably expanded its marketing, during the event, to try and attract new audiences including gamers by showing off the chip's ray tracing capabilities.\\n\\nYahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to break down his coverage of the event, what he thinks about Apple's latest announcements, and what they mean for investors.\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\n- Apple's Scary Fast event featured a host of new product announcements, including its newest MacBook Pro lineup. The tech giant's new products will feature its custom chips, the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley has the details. Dan, was it scary for you?\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: It was not scary, though they did stick to the Halloween theme the entire way through. But they did announce some new chips and some new laptops, as well as a new iMac. So let's just break it down real quick. The first things that they introduced were these new chips, the M3 line, and Apple says that this is the first time that they're rolling out three chips at once. It's the M3, the M3 Pro, and then the top of the line M3 Max.\\n\\nThe between them, really, is that the M3, it's meant for, you know, general consumers. The M3 Pro is meant for more prosumers, people that are doing some video editing, some photo editing, some gaming. And then the M3 Max is for what, you know, they essentially said were people who are doing high end CAD illustrations, people who are doing 3D animation, and then folks who are dealing with large language models and AI development.\\n\\nAnd so the products that they announced are the MacBook Pros, the 14 and 16 inch models, and those are going to start at $1,599 for the 14 inch model, with the regular M3. An M3 Pro version starts at $1,999, and then the 16 inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,499, so a little pricey proposition there, but that's always been the case with the MacBook Pros.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAnd really, I think, you know, one of the things that's interesting to look at here is how Apple is positioning these. They generally try to lean more towards creators, video editors, photo editors, folks along those lines, but this time around, the way they were positioning these products was for the average person. You know, a student, a office worker, small business owner, gamer. They really are seemingly trying to hit a large swath of the population rather than what they're traditionally known for, which is, you know, slightly more niche users as well as, you know, big Apple fans, and so they're really trying to expand out there.\\n\\nThey talked about how there's medical professionals who are using these for different tests or different diagnostics, diagnoses. There's also the gamer aspect to it, where they explain that the laptops are better at running games overall. They have new effects, dynamic caching for the GPU, which is supposed to be better for gaming, as well as 3D animation, ray tracing that's hardware-- hardware accelerated, and really saying, you know, over time they're hoping to grow that gaming category and become a larger name there.\\n\\nSo, you know, these are very impressive chips. They're three nanometer. They're, according to Apple at least, the first three nanometer chips that are available for consumer computers. They're going to continue to do what they've done for Apple, which is provide huge amounts of performance and massive amounts of battery life, you know. They're saying up to 22 hours for the 16 inch. So we'll just have to see when we can get our hands on one, but, you know, it's another big kind of move for Apple in this Mac space.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: As of right now, Dan, and in this most recent quarter, we should say, the Mac line really only accounted for what about 8% of the total financial performance for this company. You combine that with the fact that Gartner, as you've written about, has essentially called bottom on the PC market demand, so what does it mean that Apple is making these types of investments, these types of announcements even, in terms of the broader PC landscape?\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I mean, it's just great timing for them to come out with these just as, you know, as you said, Gartner called the bottom of the PC market. You know, after two years of declines, they're saying that it should start to return to growth, and so that's just really fortuitous timing for Apple. You know, these products are planned, you know, obviously very far in advance, and so I think it just happened this way that they landed now.\\n\\nI think that it'll help apple grow the Mac section, but I wouldn't expect to, you know, going into these announcements coming up for the earnings, to take anything away from what these products are going to do for the prior quarter. The prior quarter closed already, so you're going to be looking forward to the next quarter for an impact here. For the current quarter that's about to be reported, though, yeah, Apple sales for laptops are supposed to be lower, for desktops supposed to be lower.\\n\\nI forgot to mention they also announced the 24 inch iMac. That's their all in one desktop. Very popular among consumers, especially, you know, people who have multiple people in their homes. So that's also a chance for them to buoy their bottom line after not upgrading that for a few years there. So, you know, overall it looks as though this is going to help improve the Mac revenue. We just have to see how much of an impact it has, and, you know, what it means that we're going to see a turnaround in that segment of the, you know, broader consumer tech landscape, especially since we saw such steep declines over the past two years.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, quite the mischief night announcement coming from Apple there. TAM for sure.\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: Oh, mischief night, yeah.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, exactly.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-shows-off-macbooks-m3-140203045.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.996, 'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.076}}, {'date': '2023-10-31T13:39:58+00:00', 'title': 'Why it may be time for the Magnificent Seven to break up', 'content': 'Stocks may be in for a little scare heading into 2024, with Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick stating the \"setup isn\\'t great.\" Sosnick went on to convey hesitancy over the strength of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — comprised of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) — and whether they should be grouped together at all.\\n\\n\"At this point, you can\\'t look at them as seven stocks together,\" Sosnick explains to Yahoo Finance about the mixed earnings results from Big Tech players. \"Tesla is, I think, at risk of being kicked out of the club right now because they\\'ve been really underperforming since their earnings have come out.\"\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-may-time-magnificent-seven-133958352.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'NVD.F', 'NVD.XETRA', 'NVDA.MX', 'NVDA.US', 'NVDC34.SA', 'TL0.F', 'TL0.XETRA', 'TSLA.MX'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.434, 'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.06}}, {'date': '2023-10-31T12:35:00+00:00', 'title': '3 Undervalued Stocks With Potential to Hit Trillion-Dollar Milestone', 'content': 'At the beginning of October, Bankrate.com published a list of the five most valuable tech giants.

So, for the purposes of this article, Nvidia is excluded from the selection process.\\n\\nHere are three future trillion-dollar companies that appear reasonably priced to undervalued.\\n\\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\\n\\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only one of the three that has the possibility of hitting a trillion-dollar market cap in 2024. Its volatility works for and against its share price movement.\\n\\nWith a current market cap of $650 billion, it traded for nearly double in November 2021. In fact, it officially joined the trillion-dollar club on October 25th, 2021, only to fall out in the following spring.\\n\\nThe biggest issue holding back Tesla from reentering the trillion-dollar companies club are the worries that the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) will take much longer than initially anticipated, making Tesla’s EV price reductions a permanent thing, and a drag on revenues and profits.\\n\\n“But the EV market is wobbling as high interest rates dampen customer demand for electric and other vehicles. That’s ‘preventing a lot of people from even getting into the market,’ Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, told Fortune.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs Fortune reported, Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings per share\\xa0were 10% lower than analyst expectations, and the lowest in the past eight quarterly reports. The poor results shaved nearly $140 billion off its market cap, making the move to a trillion that much more difficult.\\n\\nSomething positive has to happen to change the trajectory of its stock. However, of all the S&P 500 stocks with a market cap greater than $100 billion, it’s the only one that has a shot in 2024.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAs much as I love Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), it is not a high growth company. With a current market cap of $724 billion, its share price would have to increase by 38% to push its market cap over $1 trillion.\\n\\nCan this happen in 2024? Sure, it’s possible, but not probable. According to Berkshire’s 2022 shareholder letter, its share price has increased by 30% annually on 20 occasions since 1965. The most recent occurrence in 2013, up 32.7%. Before that, it was 1998 (52.2%).\\n\\nNow, if its share price increases by 17.5% annually over the next two years, it can get to $1 trillion. Since 2013, its share price has met this level 50% of the time. That’s very doable.\\n\\nThe big thing that will prevent it from getting there in the next two years would be the death of Warren Buffett. That would most certainly send shares lower. How long they would remain low would depend on the transition plan and how well it is executed.\\n\\nKnowing Buffett, that won’t be a problem. Berkshire’s already revealed that Greg Abel, the person in charge of its non-insurance operating businesses, will be the next CEO after Buffett dies or steps down.\\n\\nIn March, Abel added to his Berkshire stock, bringing his total stake to $105 million, more than enough incentive to keep growing the business after the Buffett/Munger era officially ends.\\n\\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\\n\\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI picked Visa (NYSE:V) because I thought its consistency would help its share price continue higher despite a possible recession in 2024. Sure, its overall business is driven by transactions processed for bank credit cards, etc., which would likely drop in such an event, but it remains an excellent business that trades at a reasonable value.\\n\\nVisa’s current market cap\\xa0is $464 billion, meaning it would have to double and then some for it to enter the trillion-dollar club. That’s unlikely to happen in the next 2-3 years.\\n\\nHowever, if the company continues to invest in technology to keep pace with the fintech industry, I don’t see why it can’t happen within the next five years.\\n\\nVisa recently announced a $100 million generative AI venture fund that will invest in up-and-coming businesses that are the “next generation of companies focused on developing generative AI technologies and applications that will impact the future of commerce and payments.”\\n\\nVisa has utilized artificial intelligence (AI) since 1993, so it knows a thing or two about machine learning and the part it will play in the financial services industry.\\n\\nYou’ll notice that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the company in the S&P 500 closest to $1 trillion, is not on my trillion-dollar companies list. I feel there are too many uncertainties with social media at the moment to warrant inclusion.\\n\\nMaybe next year.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, McKesson MCK, Emerson Electric EMR and Bae Systems BAESY.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\nApple, Bitcoin and the FOMC: Global Week Ahead\\n\\nAcross the Global Week Ahead, central bankers keep stock traders on alert:\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Bank of Japan (BoJ) reports Tuesday\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The U.S. Federal Reserve reports Wednesday, and\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Bank of England (BoE) reports Thursday\\n\\nOut AMC on Thursday, Apple tops the bill for earnings, on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nOn Friday at 8:30 am ET, we get the OCT U.S. nonfarm jobs report.\\n\\nNext are Reuters\\' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—\\n\\n(1) This week will be a core S&P500 earnings season week.\\n\\nApple headlines another busy week of U.S. corporate earnings, with the iPhone maker reporting AMC on Thursday.\\n\\nShares of Apple, the world\\'s largest company by market value, have helped drive equity indexes higher this year, along with shares of other mega-cap U.S. tech and growth companies. But the stock has pulled back sharply since late July, when the S&P500 hit its high for 2023.\\n\\nResults already in from mega-caps have prompted a mixed reaction, with shares of Alphabet and Tesla slumping after their respective reports.\\n\\nConsumers\\' spending habits will also be on display.\\n\\nOther companies set to report include:\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Caterpillar and Pfizer on Tuesday\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mondelez on Wednesday, and\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Starbucks and Eli Lilly on Thursday\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n(2) Bitcoin prices are rising, rising... and then?\\n\\nBitcoin has had a stellar ride recently, with traders getting excited about the possibility that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve an application for a spot bitcoin ETF.\\n\\nEarlier this month, bitcoin jumped sharply on a false report that BlackRock\\'s ETF application had been approved.\\n\\nLast week, a listing of BlackRock\\'s planned ETF on a clearing house website sent speculators into a frenzy — even after the clearing house said this was just standard practice for pending applications rather than a sign of any regulatory approval.\\n\\nStill, the cryptocurrency is trading at around half the $69,000 peak it reached in November 2021.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the fraud trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, whose crypto firm FTX collapsed a year ago, is captivating crypto watchers around the globe.\\n\\n(3) On Wednesday, a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting breaks up.\\n\\nA bruised U.S. stock market will turn its attention to the Fed monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, with investors eager to hear policymakers\\' views on the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.\\n\\nFutures tied to the main policy rate show most traders don\\'t expect the Fed to raise borrowing costs, though some believe a rate increase could come when the central bank meets again in December.\\n\\nSigns that policymakers still intend to keep rates around current levels through next year could bolster bets on further upside in U.S. Treasury yields, whose climb to their highest levels in more 15 years has contributed to a sharp sell-off in the S&P500.\\n\\nThe index has fallen more than -10% since hitting a year-high in late-July, though is still up nearly +8% on the year.\\n\\n(4) On Tuesday, what does the Bank of Japan (BoJ) do to yields?\\n\\nIt\\'s no secret that the Bank of Japan has a penchant for surprises, making Halloween Tuesday a fitting day for its policy announcement.\\n\\nOctober\\'s global bond market ructions have made the meeting very much a live one, as soaring U.S. Treasury yields helped push Japan\\'s benchmark to decade highs every day for over a week.\\n\\nWhile the peak of 0.885% is still below the BOJ\\'s 1% policy ceiling, that\\'s partly because the central bank has been leaping into the market with emergency operations about twice a week on average. Overnight index swaps offer a cleaner view of where markets put 10-year yields without BOJ interference, popping as high as 1.0863% in recent days.\\n\\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda has insisted the bank will take a patient approach to removing stimulus, but markets will remember his comments from late July about maintaining accommodative policy — just days before the last surprise tweak.\\n\\n(5) On Thursday, the Bank of England steps up to the plate.\\n\\nHow many policymakers does it take to set interest rates when inflation is high and the economy is flat-lining? The answer in the Bank of England\\'s case is nine, and they will gather in committee on Nov. 2nd for their penultimate meeting of 2023.\\n\\nAhead of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC\\'s) first meeting of 2023, inflation was running at 10.1%, GDP showed 1% year-on-year growth and interest rates were at 3.5%.\\n\\nFast forward to now, and year-on-year growth has halved, rates are at 5.25% and inflation is still high at 6.7% — well above 4.3% in the Eurozone and 3.7% in the United States.\\n\\nThe BoE, like other central banks, will want to ram home the message that rates won\\'t fall anytime soon.\\n\\nRight now, markets are pretty sure of at least one, if not two, cuts next year.\\n\\nIt could take some tough talk to shift that.\\n\\nZacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks\\n\\n(1) McKesson: This is a $451 a share stock in the Medical-Dental Supplies industry.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.\\n\\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Apple\\n\\nThe Senior Director of Corporate Accounting, Chris Kondo, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$149 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$170, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 39% of Chris Kondo's stake. Chris Kondo was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.\\n\\nChris Kondo divested 24.29k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$153. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\\n\\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\\n\\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\\n\\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Apple insiders own about US$1.7b worth of shares (which is 0.06% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Apple Insiders?\\n\\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Apple shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Apple insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Apple. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Apple you should know about.\\n\\nOf course Apple may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Here's what he loves right now\\n\\nThere’s plenty of doom and gloom about the global economy right now. But Blackrock’s (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink seems to have spotted a silver lining in the midst of the dark clouds. “I’m more optimistic than ever,” he told CNBC’s Jim Cramer in a recent interview.\\n\\nWith $9 trillion in assets under management and one of the most popular index funds in its arsenal, Blackrock has unique insight into the state of the economy. This is why optimism from the world’s biggest asset manager is noteworthy. “We have a better texture on the market through our ETF platform and global network,” Fink says.\\n\\nDon’t miss\\n\\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds 'A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepare\\n\\nFink acknowledges the headwinds, specifically related to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and sticky inflation. But he says he’s growing increasingly optimistic about long-term trends that overlap to create unique opportunities for investors. Consequently, he believes investors with the right risk appetite should be at least 80% in equities, and perhaps 100% if they can handle it.\\n\\nHere are some of those overlapping trends he loves right now.\\n\\nHard assets\\n\\n“I’m a hopeful person,” Fink said during the Cramer interview. “I believe in 10 or 20 years humanity [will be] in a better position than it is today. With that view, I want to own hard assets today. I want to own equities. I want to be part of this economy.”\\n\\nHard assets or tangible assets — physical materials such as real estate, collectibles, precious metals like gold, and natural resources like oil, gas and food crops — are traditionally considered a safe haven during periods of economic turmoil and inflation. But Fink prefers certain types of hard assets over others. The Blackrock CEO has previously pointed out the risk to commercial real estate from rising levels of remote work.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nInstead of office and retail, Fink prefers infrastructure assets.\\n\\n“As the IRA is being implemented, these are good healthy long-term investments,” he says, highlighting the impact of the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill. He believes there are infrastructure opportunities that have the potential to deliver “anywhere from 8% to 15% returns with high probabilities of success.”\\n\\nDouble-digit returns are attractive in any environment, but especially noteworthy when they’re backed by hard assets.\\n\\nRead more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how\\n\\nAI and robotics\\n\\nRising trade tensions, Fink believes, are a headwind for automation. “We’re going to see an acceleration of fragmentation of the supply chains because of geopolitical issues,” he says. “As we advance AI and robotics, there is such an enormous opportunity for nearshoring.”\\n\\nNearshoring is a term used by industry experts to describe the relocation of factories and manufacturing hubs to countries that are closer to consumers. But, considering that China is the world’s largest manufacturing hub, nearshoring in the near future simply means diversifying away from China.\\n\\nAbout 70% of business leaders across the U.S. and Europe said they were actively considering nearshoring or reshoring, according to a survey by ABB. And 40% of them said automation and robotics were part of the plan.\\n\\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have already deployed robots to manage inventory in warehouses and recycle phone parts. This trend could accelerate as the automation technology gets more advanced and the need to bring manufacturing back home becomes more pertinent.\\n\\nFink’s optimism about these trends is palpable but investors must also consider that his firm makes money on general optimism. Better market sentiment translates to better capital inflows for Blackrock’s funds and higher management fees for the company.\\n\\nAs Warren Buffett once said, “Don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut.”\\n\\nWhat to read next\\n\\nWorried about the economy?

To jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list and skip all the latest news about Asia, its economy, and its financial markets, take a look at 5 Best Asian Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\nCourtesy of its population and a late shift towards industrialization, Asia is the economically fastest growing region in the world, with big businesses, large governments, and sizeable middle class populations eager to spend money and grow the economy. The rise of China, in just a couple of decades, after its contract manufacturing economic model enabled its rise as the world's largest economy, has shaped the global world order in ways that might be considered surprising during the late 1990s. At the same time, globalization and trade have produced groups of countries in Southeast and East Asia that have surpassed the economic output of all if not most European nations.\\n\\nFor instance, consider our list of the world's largest economies ranked through currency adjustments. Out of the five biggest economies in the world, three are Asian countries, while out of the remaining, one is the U.S. and the other is Germany. GDP data from the World Bank shows that Asian countries accounted for 42% of global GDP in PPP terms, cementing the fact that the continent is one of the most important regions for global stability. High industrial growth in Asian countries, notably India and China, often drives entire industries such as metals and minerals. The Asian growth spurt is helped by the fact that the continent is significantly larger in terms of area than Europe, and its working age population has grown at some of the fastest rates in the world. Asia also covers 45 million square kilometers in area, which is more than twice the area of Europe and the U.S. combined.\\n\\nTherefore, some of the world's biggest industries such as construction and air travel are predicted to see faster growth in Asia than in either North America or Europe. Starting from real estate, the global real estate industry was valued at an unbelievable $28 trillion in 2021, and over the course of the next ten years, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to be worth $48 trillion in 2031. Within this industry, which is made of all of the world's priciest property markets, geographically, Asia Pacific was the biggest sector as it accounted for two fifths of the total industry value.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAir travel, on the other hand, was worth $531 billion in 2021 and is slated to grow to $635 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 3.10%. Just like real estate, Asia Pacific also dominates the air travel industry since it accounts for 47% of the total global spending. Shifting our focus to the global information technology and automotive industries, most, if not all, of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones are made in China, and big Japanese firms such as Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) command strong market shares in their industries. Asia also includes some of the most technologically advanced nations in the world, and its rapid modernization in key sectors such as space exploration and semiconductor fabrication has placed countries and regions such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan at the top of the global technology food chain. South Korea is the world's second highest spender in GDP percentage terms on research and development, and five countries in our list of the 20 Most Advanced Countries in the World in 2023 are Asian.\\n\\nOn the economic front, Asian countries vary in their performance. South Korea, known for its mega business conglomerates and high technology companies, was another developed economy that grew in the third quarter after U.S. data broke two year growth records. Data from the Korean central bank, Bank of Korea, revealed that the East Asian nation's economy grew by 0.6% during the third quarter, which was accompanied by a 2.5% growth in gross domestic income (GDI). At the same time, the business sentiment of Korean firms, such as the business conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (LON:SMSN.L), remained consistent among responses by manufacturing and service sector firms. As a whole, out of the 3,165 companies surveyed by the Korean central bank, most remained pessimistic about the future amid low readings for the Business Survey Index (BSI) for the manufacturing and non manufacturing sectors.\\n\\nHowever, as the Korean economy grows, the property markets of China and Hong Kong continue to show signs of trouble. Home prices dropped in China for the third consecutive month in September, as realtors worried that despite a drop in policies that stimulated the price reduction, the demand for homes did not increase. The low demand was clear as property sales by floor area in China tanked by 19.77% annually in September after witnessing a 23.95% drop in August. Similarly, Asia's business and shipping hub Hong Kong is still reeling from an exodus of some the wealthiest members of its population, as it seeks to introduce lower property stamp duties and two year visas for graduates from the world's top 100 universities that have more than three years of working experience.\\n\\nWith Asia remaining as diverse as ever, we decided to look at some top Asian stocks to buy based on hedge fund sentiment. The top three stocks in this list are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD). 12 Best Asian Stocks To Buy Now\\n\\nPixabay/Public Domain\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo make our list of the best Asian stocks to buy, we first compiled the 40 most valuable Asian companies that are traded on the NASDAQ and NYSE stock exchanges.

The base model has eight main cores — the processing engines on a chip — in addition to 10 cores for graphics. The company also announced higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max chips as part of a “Scary Fast”-branded product unveiling, an unusually timed event that kicked off at 5 p.m. California time.\\n\\nNew MacBook Pro models, also unveiled at the half-hour event, will run the new processors. The company announced a low-end model at $1,599 with the standard M3 chip, as well as high-end versions that run M3 Pro and M3 Max configurations. The chip technology will make the new laptops more powerful while retaining their 22 hours of battery life, Apple said. The tech giant also debuted a version of its 24-inch all-in-one iMac desktop computer that runs the M3.\\n\\nThe company’s homegrown semiconductor business — known as Apple Silicon — has become a prized asset. Since switching to its own chips from Intel Corp. components in 2020, Apple has seen sales of its Mac computers grow sharply, helped by a broader run-up in tech spending during the pandemic.\\n\\nBut in recent quarters, Mac revenue began to slide again and competition has intensified. The M3 launch is meant to help restore Apple’s advantage in the industry and get the Mac business back on track. Sales of the computers are forecast to climb about 5% in the holiday quarter, with revenue growing 5.5% in the fiscal year that began this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe switch to the M3 marks the first time Apple — or any other high-volume computer manufacturer — has moved to the 3-nanometer technology. The process squeezes in more transistors, getting more technology into a tighter space. Such chips are designed to amp up performance while still saving battery life.\\n\\nBy using in-house chips, Apple can tailor its hardware and software together to create a better overall user experience. The Cupertino, California-based company said that its top MacBook Pro is now 11 times faster than the speediest Intel laptop.\\n\\nThe M3 chip is 35% faster than the M1 chip for standard computing tasks and 65% better at graphics. The M3 Pro has four more main processing cores, including a 12-core design. It also comes with up to 18 graphics cores. The M3 Max increases both the main processing and graphics cores, resulting in a design with 16 main cores and up to 40 graphics cores.\\n\\nApple’s new iMac represents the first update to the all-in-one desktop computer since it was redesigned in April 2021. The iMac was the only Mac to skip the M2 generation, leaping directly from the M1 to the M3 chip. The company said the new version is twice as fast as the prior one and has better graphics performance. The latest model comes in several colors, including pink, green and silver.\\n\\nThe new Macs lack any other major new features beyond the new chips. But the MacBook Pro does offer 20% more brightness — for content without high-dynamic-range colors — as well as a new “space black” color option. Bloomberg News earlier reported on the new Macs and processors.\\n\\nOther than the new low-end MacBook Pro, Apple has kept pricing mostly in line with prior models. The iMac continues to start at $1,299, the M3 Pro MacBook Pro is $1,999, and the M3 Max MacBook Pro begins at $2,499. A fully loaded high-end MacBook Pro with a 16-inch screen, 40 graphics cores, eight terabytes of storage and 128 gigabytes of memory comes in at $7,199, according to Apple’s online store.\\n\\nApple’s announcement follows other signs that the computer processor business is heating up. Intel, its former partner, gave an upbeat forecast last week that sent shares soaring. Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are working on new processors based on technology from Arm Holdings Plc. And Qualcomm Inc. unveiled a laptop processor last week that it touted as faster than Apple’s M2.\\n\\n(Updates with more from event starting in third paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nIs This Poop-Test Startup Just Wellness Theater?

That, Apple says, makes the 24-inch all-in-one 2x faster than an iMac with an M1 chip. The system also offers a 30% performance boost while using Excel and 30% jump in Safari performance.\\n\\nApple says the M3-equipped desktop is 4x faster than an Intel-powered 21.5-inch iMac, and 2.5x faster than the 27-inch iMac with an Intel chip.\\n\\nWhile Apple is in its third-generation of M processors, there are still plenty of Intel-powered Macs in the wild.

Apple says the chips’ GPUs offer a new feature called Dynamic Caching, which is a unique way of allocating memory for graphics-heavy operations.\\n\\nThe idea is to ensure the software you’re using is getting the most out of the GPU’s available resources. The company says the feature will dramatically improve performance across graphics-intensive apps and games.\\n\\nThe M3’s GPUs also now include hardware-accelerated ray tracing, which improves how light interacts with scenes in games and apps to create more realistic images. Overall, Apple says the M3’s GPUs can deliver the same performance as the M1 while using almost half of the power, and, when pushed, put out 65% more performance at its peak.\\n\\nStory continues Apple's M3 line of chips. (Image: Apple)\\n\\nThe base M3 features an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, features a whopping 25 billion transistors, and can be outfitted with up to 24GB of memory. Apple uses what’s called unified memory, which means the CPU and GPU share a single pool of memory.\\n\\nThe M3 Pro is for consumers and semi-professionals who need a bigger performance boost to handle everything from photo and video editing to architectural renderings and business apps. It comes with 37 billion transistors, a 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, and supposes up to 36GB of memory.\\n\\nAt the top of the line is the M3 Max, which has 92 billion transistors, 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores, and up to 128GB of memory. This is the chip you’d get if you’re doing serious 3D animation, working with CAD files, or working with large language models.\\n\\nCompetition is ramping up\\n\\nApple designs its chips as a means of differentiating the company’s computers from Windows-based systems and Chromebooks. By controlling the chips, hardware, and software that power its laptops and desktops, Apple is able to exert a level of control other companies simply can’t match.\\n\\nAnd while the Cupertino, California-based company has only been putting its own chips in its laptops and desktops for 3 years, Apple has been designing its iPhone chips for years. That expertise has translated into some impressive performance gains over the years while improving overall battery life. Apple says MacBooks with M3 chips can get up to 22 hours of battery life. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.\\n\\nBut competition is stirring in the chip space from the likes of Qualcomm (QCOM) and, reportedly, Nvidia (NVDA). Last week, Qualcomm debuted its new Snapdragon X Elite chip, which the company says matches the power of Apple’s M2 Max, while using less power.\\n\\nQualcomm’s Arm-based chip will only be found in Windows systems. And while that means there’s no direct competition between that company’s chips and Apple’s, if Qualcomm’s offering lives up to its claims, the chip could serve as a catalyst to convince consumers who were thinking of buying a Mac to buy a Windows-based machine instead.\\n\\nIt’s not just Qualcomm gunning for Apple’s power versus performance capabilities. According to Reuters, Nvidia is also working on its own Arm-based chip that could rival Apple’s processors.\\n\\nAll of this also spells trouble for Intel (INTC), which needs consumers to buy Windows-based systems that use its chips to ensure it holds onto its share of the CPU market. According to IDC, 64% of the new consumer PC shipments had Intel chips in 2022. But as competitors continue to roll out new, intriguing chip options, Intel’s job could become more difficult.\\n\\nStill, with chips like the M3 line hitting the market, and clear signs that Apple will continue releasing new processors on a yearly cadence, it could take some time before the competition catches up.\\n\\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

The new iMac desktop with the M3 family of chips starts at $1,299. Some will be available next week, while others will not ship until later in November.\\n\\nApple has seen a revitalization in its Mac business, roughly doubling its market share to nearly 11% since 2020 when it parted ways with Intel and started using its own custom-designed chips as the brains of the machines, according to preliminary data from IDC.\\n\\nAs part of the focus on business users on Monday, it showed off a new secure screen sharing feature that would let them on their machines from remote locations.\\n\\nThe company's custom chips, which use design technology from Arm Holdings , have given its Macs better battery life and, for some tasks, better performance than machines using Microsoft's Windows operating system.\\n\\nUnlike other laptop makers that might combine a central processor unit (CPU) from Intel with a GPU from Nvidia, Apple has combined both parts in its Apple silicon chips, which the company claims gives it better performance than its rivals.\\n\\nApple's shakeup of the market has spurred Qualcomm to redouble its efforts to make Arm-based chips for Windows, announcing plans last week to release a chip that is both faster and more energy efficient than some Apple offerings. Reuters last week reported that Nvidia also plans to jump into the PC market as early as 2025.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCORPORATE BUYING\\n\\nApple aimed the new machines squarely at designers, musicians and software developers, at one point highlighting that the way it users memory can be used by artificial intelligence researchers, whose chatbots and other creations are often constrained by how much data can be held in the computer's memory.\\n\\nApple also tweaked its overall lineup of computers in ways that could change the behavior of corporate buyers.\\n\\nWhile slashing the U.S. price of the new 14-inch MacBook Pro from $1,999 to $1,599, Apple appeared to have eliminated a cheaper $1,299 13-inch model of its MacBook Pro that was a big seller to businesses, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies.\\n\\nThat move will likely clarify the choice between the company's model lines, prompting choices between Apple's productivity-oriented MacBook Air models that top out at $1,299 or the new $1,599 starting price for MacBook Pro models.\\n\\nAt Apple, the Mac hit $40.18 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2022, or about 11% of its revenue. While that was up 14% from the previous fiscal year, sales this year have slowed along with the rest of the PC industry, which has suffered a post-pandemic slump.\\n\\nApple said the new chips would be the first for laptops and desktops that use 3 nanometer manufacturing technology, which will give the chips better performance for each watt of electricity used.\\n\\nApple did not name who is making the chips, but analysts believe it is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which uses the same technology to make chips for the top-end iPhone 15 models.\\n\\nThroughout the event, Apple executives compared the performance of the new MacBooks and iMac machines to older Apple machines with chips from Intel, playing up how much speed customers would notice by upgrading to devices with Apple's own chips.

This marked a sizeable growth over Appaloosa Management's investment portfolio during 2023's first quarter, as by the end of Q1 2023, the firm had total investments of $1.8 billion.\\n\\nNaturally, a near tripling of a hedge fund's investment portfolio merits a closer look under the hood, which becomes even more important when we consider the current U.S. stock market climate. 2023 has been a surprising year when it comes to market and economic performance, and even new records set by some indices such as the NASDAQ which would normally be a positive occurrence have done little to quell fears about the future. This is because even though the market has posted significant gains this year, these have mostly been influenced by the price appreciation of big tech stocks and the future of the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle is unclear. Investors are currently preparing their bets about when rates will start to come down, but they have little robust economic data to suggest that the rates might come down soon as the labor market and inflation continue to post surprises and geopolitical conflict in the Middle East carries the risk of further stoking inflation due to oil price rising\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhen it comes to investment strategy, Mr. Tepper's hedge fund invests in both debt and equity markets. It has the tendency to concentrate its investments into a handful of companies through taking multi million dollar investment positions, as should be evident through the June 2023 portfolio. The firm is also a fan of mega cap technology firms, as its three largest positions are in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). These are worth $431 million for NVIDIA, $431 for Meta, and $422 million for Microsoft - to account for more than one fifth of the portfolio.\\n\\nThese days, David Tepper is in the news not because of his hedge fund, but because of his sports team. One of the biggest symbols of wealth and prestige in America is owning a sports team, and Mr. Tepper is one of the few hedge fund investors with one. In fact, he owns not one but two teams, after having bought the football team Carolina Panthers in 2018 after selling his shares in the Pittsburgh Steelers and bidding a whopping $2.2 billion. Not content with an American Football team, the billionaire expanded his sports portfolio to include soccer as well and he bought Charlotte FC a year later in 2019.\\n\\nFor Mr. Tepper, his football team's under performance has pushed his involvement into the spotlight. The Panthers' head coach Frank Reich outlined in a press conference recently that Mr. Tepper is an engaged owner who wants to see the team win which is in contrast to other owners who are often more laid back. This strong approach by the billionaire hedge fund boss has also seen criticism from the Panthers' fans and analysts, who have criticized Mr. Tepper by pointing out that his notable achievements in the financial world might not be transferable to football. The criticism is also involved around the team's quarterback, with some quarters claiming that Mr. Tepper had influenced his selection and the debate is further complicated by Young's underperformance in recent games.\\n\\nShifting gears to focus on financial news related to David Tepper, he recently spoke with CNBC and shared that the higher interest rate environment simply means that the market multiples of the past do not apply anymore.\\n\\nAccording to him:\\n\\nIt's not that complicated right now. You're just not in QE times anymore. You're in the QT era. It's a higher rate environment. Can't be the same multiples as before, it's not bad, it's just different. It's just a different environment.\\n\\nCNBC's Michael Santoli also revealed that Mr. Tepper actually invested in cash recently, as he secured a Certificate of Deposit with a 6% rate to profit from the high interest rates. This latest David Tepper investment can also be read as a signal to be bullish on the U.S. Dollar, which always gains whenever investors believe that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates even further or cut them later than expected.\\n\\nSo, what are David Tepper's latest portfolio changes?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest economies in the world by 2075.\\n\\nIn both 2022 and 2023, the global economy has struggled significantly after record inflation enveloped most countries across the world, followed by central banks hiking interest rates in a bid to curb inflation as economic activity and growth slowed down. This impact was also felt in the largest economies in the world by 2075, even though the U.S., currently the country with the highest GDP in the world, saw a growth rate of 4.9% in Q3 2023, a better than expected performance. Increased consumer spending, higher contribution by exports, residential investment and higher governmental spending all contributed to a better performance by the most advanced country in the world.\\n\\nDespite the spectacular performance by the U.S., the overall global economic outlook is still not very positive, as the global growth rate was expected to be just 3% in 2023 and 2024, growth lower than even 2022 where it landed at 3.5%. There is still some positivity to focus on, as inflation has fallen worldwide barring a few exceptions and global headline inflation is expected to fall to 6.8% in 2023, down from 8.7% in 2022. 25 Largest Economies in the World by 2075\\n\\nJirsak/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOne of the biggest reasons why the global economy is growing at a lower rate than expected earlier is due to the economic slowdown in China, which will be one of the largest economies in the world by 2075. China pursued a zero-Covid policy long after most countries abandoned it and instituted lockdowns for far longer. While the country abandoned this approach towards the end of 2022, the economy has still struggled to return to normalcy, amid a major property crisis. There\\'s a saying that when the United States sneezes, the world catches a cold, signifying its influence on the global economy but China\\'s meteoric rise over the past few decades has seen a similar influence. Many of the biggest countries in the world derive a large percentage of their sales from China, and when governmental officials in the country were banned from using iPhones,\\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw its share price all immediately.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDespite this concern, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) actually saw a much better performance in China in Q3 2023 especially when compared to Q2 2023, which was mentioned in the company\\'s Q3 2023 earnings call, where its CEO Tim Cook stated \"If you sort of step around the world, we did exceptionally well in emerging markets last quarter and even better on a constant currency basis. And so emerging markets were — was a strength. If you look at China, in China, we went from a negative 3% in Q2 to a plus 8% in Q3. And so in China, we had an acceleration..... \\xa0Switchers were a very key part of our iPhone results for the quarter. We did set a record. We set a record in Greater China, in particular, and it was at the heart of our results there. And we continue to try to convince more and more people to switch because of our — the experience and the ecosystem and — that we can offer them. And so I think switching is a huge opportunity for us. In terms of the upgrade cycle and so forth, it’s very difficult to estimate real time what is going on with the upgrade cycle. I would say, if you think about the iPhone results year-over-year, you have to think about the SE announcement in the year ago quarter, the iPhone SE announcement in the year ago quarter. And so that provides a bit of a headwind on the comp. But as Luca said, as he talked about how we’re viewing Q4, the September quarter, we see iPhone accelerating in Q4.\" However, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been caught up in Big Tech entering a market correction and has lost over 2% of its share price in October, though in YTD 2023, it has still increased by 33%.\\n\\nWhile most of the countries counted among the largest economies in the world by 2030 will also be among the top 20 economies in the world in 2075, there are still some surprises. One of the biggest surprises is that the U.S. won\\'t even be among the two largest economies in the world by 2075! One of the reasons why the developed world may struggle to grow at a healthy rate is due to lower population growth rates, as the countries with the highest fertility rates are predominantly among developing economies. This is why Emerging Markets boast a much higher growth rate than Developed Markets, and the largest economies in the world in 2050 will be China, the U.S., India, Indonesia and Germany.\\n\\nIt may be startling to learn that the U.S. won\\'t be even among the top two economies in the world by 2075, but it is important to consider that its population is much smaller than China and India for example, with the latter becoming the most populous country in the world in 2023. Additionally, the U.S. has outperformed expectations significantly over the past decade, which is not likely to be repeated anytime in the next 50 years at least, and even the exceptional strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to unwind over the next decade as growth slows down compared to other economies. The growth of emerging markets has also been extremely important for a decrease in global inequality; however, the downside is that inequality within countries has continued to increase.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nTo determine the biggest economies in the world by 2075, we consulted a report developed by Goldman Sachs, which assesses growth rates of each country and ascertains what their GDP will be in 2075. As we mentioned earlier, there are likely to be a few surprises, so let\\'s take a look at the global superpowers, or those expected to be, by 2075.\\n\\n25. South Africa\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 3.3\\n\\nPower cuts have impacted South Africa\\'s economy, but it has beaten forecasts in Q2 2023.\\n\\n24. South Korea\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 3.4\\n\\nSouth Korea has developed into an economic powerhouse in the last several decades, and is expected to remain among the biggest economies in the world by 2075.\\n\\n23. Malaysia\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 3.5\\n\\nMalaysia has established itself as a hub for East Asia regional activities, but posted its weakest GDP growth in almost two years because of a slump in exports.\\n\\n22. Italy\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 3.8\\n\\nConcerns regarding Italy\\'s long term growths have persisted for a while now, and the country\\'s central bank governor has urged the country\\'s head to heed investors\\' debt fears.\\n\\n21. Australia\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 4.3\\n\\nAn aging population and lower birth rates are the biggest contributors to the country\\'s growth rate falling, and high underlying inflation is expected to impact the country\\'s growth in the immediate future.\\n\\n20. Turkey\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 5.2\\n\\nIn September 2023, Turkey increased inflation rates and lowered economic growth expectations, as the country has struggled to cope with high inflation and currency depreciation.\\n\\n19. Canada\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 5.2\\n\\nCurrently, Canada does not look like a nation expected to be among the largest economies in the world by 2o75, as the domestic economy has weakened while its currency has continued to depreciate. Recently, the Bank of Canada decided to hold rates while admitting that inflationary risks were increasing in the country.\\n\\n18. Saudi Arabia\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 6.1\\n\\nThe oil rich nation has one of the highest GDP per capita in the world, which has already accorded it influence on the global stage. In 2022, Saudi Arabia managed a growth rate of 8.7%\\xa0 and has continued to increase spending, though the biggest challenge for the country is to oil-proof its future.\\n\\n17. Ethiopia\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 6.2\\n\\nEthiopia has been mired in a civil war which has cost tens of thousands of lives and led to major instability in the country. However, the potential for growth in the country is huge, with the next decade likely defining how much Ethiopia can expect to progress in the next half century.\\n\\n16. Bangladesh\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 6.3\\n\\nBangladesh is home to one of the most densely populated cities in the world in Dhaka. While S&P expected the country to continue to grow at around 6.4% annually from 2024 to 2026, liquidity risks led to S&P changing the outlook of the country to negative.\\n\\n15. France\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 6.5\\n\\nFrance was the fourth largest economy in the world in 1980, but has continued to slide down the rankings. Even in 2022, it had already fallen to 7th place and a slow growth rate combined with low birth rate means that the economic slide will continue well into the future.\\n\\n14. Philippines\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 6.6\\n\\nPhilippines is expected to maintain a growth rate of nearly 5% from 2030 to 2039, which will allow it to surpass even top European economies such as France in the longer term.\\n\\n13. Russia\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 6.9\\n\\nRussia significantly underperformed Goldman Sach\\'s expectations in the last decade and is likely to slide further as a result of its invasion of Ukraine combined with heavy sanctions from Western nations. Currently the 9th largest economy in the world, these issues, unless mostly reversed in the next few years, will see the country slide to 13th position among the biggest global economies in 2075.\\n\\n12. Japan\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 7.5\\n\\nJapan has managed to recover output lost during the Covid-19 pandemic and according to Deloitte, its economy is now likely to slow down which will allow the nation to maintain its monetary policy at least into 2024.\\n\\n11. Mexico\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 7.6\\n\\nAccording to the IMF, Mexico is currently undergoing a broad-based expansion, with growth expected to be at 3.2% in 2023. The construction, auto production and service sectors will drive higher growth in one of the largest economies in the world by 2075.\\n\\n10. United Kingdom\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 7.6\\n\\nThe United Kingdom has faced severe economic pressure in the last couple of years, not helped by political instability in the country. The increased cost of living and energy crisis has further added to economies woes, but over the longer term, the UK is expected to maintain its reputation as one of the most influential countries in the world.\\n\\n9. Germany\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 8.1\\n\\nGermany is the biggest economy in Europe, and its real GDP growth projections will be around the 1% for each of the next several decades.\\n\\n8. Brazil\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 8.7\\n\\nBrazil is currently the biggest economy in Latin America, and will hold on to that position for the foreseeable future. Brazil has demonstrated particularly weak performance in the past 10 - 15 years which is why it\\'s not higher in our list but most of the underperformance is expected to be reversed, at least partially, in the next several years.\\n\\n7. Egypt\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 10.4\\n\\nTo become one of the biggest economies in the world by 2075, Egypt will need proper institutions and policies, and needs a big increase in stability. The lack of stability meant that Egypt underperformed earlier forecasts of growth from 2010 to 2019 by 2%, and will underperform 2011 predictions by 1.4% in 2020 - 2029 too.\\n\\n6. Pakistan\\n\\nExpected GDP in 2075 (in $ trillion): 12.3\\n\\nFor Pakistan to have a GDP of over $12 trillion in 2075, from a GDP of $0.1 trillion in 2022, will require a fundamental change in mindset and policies, starting with the establishment of industries and production of goods locally to boost its currency, which has depreciated by nearly 100% in less than 3 years.\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2075.

Berkshire’s estimated average price paid is $39.62, so even with the fall off since July, Apple’s share price is still up more than 34% year-to-date.\\n\\nIn a nod to Halloween and the launch of its M3 next-generation silicon chip, Apple will hold the online-only “scary fast” event on Oct. 30. As part of the event, Apple will also release a revamped version of the iMac, the first update since it launched an iMac with Apple’s own M1 chip in 2021. This chip is thought to be considerably faster.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs someone who uses a number of Apple products (iPhone, iPad, Air Pods), it would be nice if the M3 iMac were worth breaking open the piggy bank for. I guess we’ll see.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Apple releases its earnings on Nov. 2. Investors will be watching very closely. Analysts are calling for earnings per share of $1.39 in Q4 2023 from revenue of $89.31 billion. Both numbers are up from last quarter.\\n\\nWhatever happens, Buffett’s not going to be selling.\\n\\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) represents the old guard of Berkshire stocks. The company’s owned Amex stock in one form or another since 1991. It is Berkshire’s fourth-largest holding, accounting for 6.6% of its equity portfolio. The position represents a 20.8% ownership stake in the financial services company, making it by far Amex’s largest shareholder.\\n\\nIn August 1991, Buffett invested $300 million in preferred stock from the company. Berkshire’s preferred investment came with a fixed 8.5% dividend. At the time, American Express’s Shearson Lehman Bros. brokerage subsidiary was struggling, and its credit card business faced increased competition.\\n\\nAs Buffett has done many times since, he’s put his stamp of approval on struggling businesses with iconic brands — for a price, of course.\\n\\n“Getting Buffett to come in with a relatively small investment is an attempt by Robinson to rebuild confidence,” said E. Wilson Davis, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. “It says: ‘This shrewd, intelligent, nuts-and-bolts investor has confidence in American Express,’ “the Los Angeles Times reported in 1991.\\n\\nBy the end of 1998, Berkshire owned 50.54 million shares of its stock at a cost of $1.47 billion, or $29.09 a share. At the time, it was the company’s largest holding by cost. Through splits, the share count has grown to 151.61 million.\\n\\nWhile the shares haven’t performed over the past five years — up 36.3% compared to 51.2% for the S&P 500 — it gets $302 million in dividends from Amex, which it reinvests in its various businesses.\\n\\nIt’s long since paid for itself.\\n\\nMitsubishi (MSBHF) Mitsubishi Motors Canadian headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF) is the largest holding of the five Japanese trading houses that Berkshire has invested in, accounting for 1.7% of the company’s equity holdings.\\n\\nIn June, Berkshire confirmed it had added to its positions in each of the five companies. It now owns 8.3% of Mitsubishi Corp.\\n\\nNikkei Asia recently discussed how these trading companies — known as sogo shosha — have evolved into holding companies much like Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\n“Since the 1990s, the sogo shosha have shifted from a focus on trading to directly owning and running businesses as equity holders of companies and projects, which indeed has made them more comparable to U.S.-based Berkshire Hathaway,” Nikkei Asia contributor Mitsuru Claire Chino wrote on Oct. 2.\\n\\n“Today the groups have a huge global presence as strategic investors in projects and entities in a range of industries, including energy, minerals, chemicals and food. Each one is like a combined logistics provider, financier, investment firm and consulting company.”\\n\\nChino writes that Mitsubishi has partnered with Tokyo Gas (OTCMKTS:TKGSY), Osaka Gas (OTCMKTS:OSGSY), Toho Gas (OTCMKTS:THOGF) and Sempra (NYSE:SRE) to develop an e-methane plant in the Gulf Coast.

We’ve already gotten results from the big banks and several mega-cap technology players, with many more releases coming in the following weeks.\\n\\nThis week, technology titan Apple AAPL will draw the most attention, one of two remaining from the ‘Big 7’ group yet to report. As we’re all aware, these mega-cap players have led the market’s surge in 2023, delivering outsized gains to investors.\\n\\nStill, AAPL shares have faced adverse price action since their 2023 high in mid-July, down 13% since. Can a strong quarterly release breathe life back into shares? Let’s take a closer look at quarterly expectations and a few key metrics worth paying attention to. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nApple Q4\\n\\nAnalysts have primarily kept their expectations unchanged for the upcoming release, with the $1.39 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a fractional 0.6% since August and reflecting a change of +7.8% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nTop line expectations have been taken modestly lower during the same period, as the $88.8 billion quarterly revenue estimate is down 1.1% and reflects a pullback of -1.5% year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nOf course, a primary focus of the release will concern iPhone results. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for iPhone revenue stands at $44.2 billion, representing a positive change of +3.8% from the same period last year.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that the company has struggled to exceed consensus iPhone revenue expectations as of late, falling short in three of its last four releases. Still, demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been strong, likely to provide a tailwind. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nIn addition, the company’s Services portfolio has become a notable contributor to its top line, which includes revenues from cloud services, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and others. In fact, it was revealed in its latest release that its Services portfolio has amassed more than 1 billion paid subscribers and is expected to see accelerated growth in Q4 relative to Q3.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRegarding expectations, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenue stands at $21.4 billion, suggesting a climb of 11% from the year-ago period. The company has positively surprised on this metric in three consecutive quarters. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nTo top it off, the company’s Wearables results (Apple Watch, AirPods) will also be a vital metric to keep a close eye on. The segment has seen solid growth in recent years, mainly thanks to consumers' extensive adoption of the Apple Watch and AirPods.\\n\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wearables revenue presently sits at $9.3 billion, suggesting a change of -3.1% from the same period last year.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nApple’s AAPL quarterly release headlines the reporting docket this week, undoubtedly a quarterly print that can bring market-moving effects.\\n\\nAnalysts have primarily kept their expectations unchanged, with earnings forecasted to see growth amid a pullback within revenue compared to the year-ago period. In addition, iPhone and Services results are expected to see accelerated growth relative to its Q3.\\n\\nApple shares currently trade at a 25.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple, beneath the 30.1X high this year and modestly above the 24.4X five-year median.

According to court documents the government entered into the record last week, the payments came to more than $26 billion in 2021, a year in which operating expenses for Google\\'s parent company, Alphabet, were nearly $68 billion.\\n\\nGoogle contends that it dominates the market because its search engine is better than the competition\\'s. \"We are working very, very hard for any given query we provide the best experience,\\'\\' Pichai said. “That’s always been our true north.\\'\\'\\n\\nBorn in India, Pichai joined joined Google in 2004 from the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Before becoming CEO, he helped develop Google Chrome, the world’s most popular web browser, and was named to the company\\'s top job in 2015. He is also CEO of Google\\'s parent company, Alphabet. Under his leadership, the company\\'s net income ballooned to $60 billion last year from $19.5 billion in 2016, the first full year of Alphabet\\'s operation.\\n\\nAs Google\\'s star defense witness, Pichai testified Monday that Google\\'s payments to phone manufacturers and wireless phone companies were partly meant to nudge them into making costly security upgrades and other improvements to their devices, not just to ensure Google was the first search engine users encounter when they open their smartphones or computers.\\n\\nGoogle benefits from the deals because it makes money when users click on advertisements that pop up in its searches and shares the revenue with Apple and other companies that make Google their default search engine.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Justice Department sought to show that Google feared Apple might establish its own search engine and worried about losing talent to Apple. In a 2019 email shown in court, Pichai asked to be informed directly whenever a member of Google’s search engine team defected to Apple.\\n\\nThe antitrust case, the biggest since the Justice Department went after Microsoft and its dominance of internet browsers 25 years ago, was filed in 2020 during the Trump administration. The trial began Sept. 12 in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. and is expected to run for 10 weeks.\\n\\nMuch of the testimony in the case has been held behind closed doors, and a significant amount of evidence has been redacted from documents at the request of Google and Apple, whose attorneys say they need to protect trade secrets.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta likely won’t issue a ruling until early next year. If he decides Google broke the law, another trial will determine how to rein in its market power. The Mountain View, California-based company could be stopped from paying Apple and other companies to make Google the default search engine.\\n\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella testified earlier that Google has an almost hypnotic hold on users.\\n\\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella said. The only way to break the habit is by changing the default choice on devices, he said. ___ Associated Press Technology Writer Michael Liedke contributed to this report.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ceo-defends-paying-apple-173112737.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.974, 'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.08}}, {'date': '2023-10-30T17:06:36+00:00', 'title': 'Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA: Is the CPU Market Overcrowded or Just Heating Up?', 'content': \"In today's video, I discuss recent news affecting Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and other semiconductor companies in the CPU market.\\n\\nContinue reading\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8748d130-ea8a-37af-898f-5276237c2f58/apple%2C-intel%2C-amd%2C-qualcomm%2C.html', 'symbols': ['A1MD34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMD.F', 'AMD.MX', 'AMD.US', 'AMD.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'INL.F', 'INL.XETRA', 'INTC.MX', 'INTC.US', 'ITLC34.SA', 'NVD.F', 'NVD.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.25, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.938, 'pos': 0.063}}, {'date': '2023-10-30T16:35:00+00:00', 'title': 'These 3 Stocks Might Be Getting a Little Too Expensive', 'content': \"Anytime a stock is already trading at an inflated valuation, the potential for significant price appreciation shrinks.

Even Apple has opted not to create its own search engine or give priority to other options because of the lucrative, multibillion-dollar deal it has with Google, the government has argued.\\n\\nDespite having about 90% of the market for search, Google has tried to show over the course of seven weeks that it’s increasingly at the mercy of new ways people are looking for information online. Previous Google witnesses have described how people now are likely to look for items to buy on TikTok or Amazon.com Inc. or travel advice on Expedia Group Inc.\\n\\nIn his first appearance at the trial, Pichai said when Google’s longtime contract with Apple was renegotiated in 2016, he wanted to make sure that the default was “preserved” as it had been for years. He was concerned Apple might otherwise start to send queries from its Safari web browser to Amazon or others “and do additional deals,” for instance, instead of routing the query through Google search.\\n\\nAn email from 2018, written ahead of a meeting between Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook and presented at the trial, showed that Google was concerned about Apple’s “query cannibalization.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple’s default agreement with Google is by far the most significant because of the market share enjoyed by the iPhone. The exact amount of the deal isn’t public, though the Justice Department previously said Google pays Apple between $4 billion and $8 billion a year. In 2016, Pichai was Google’s lead negotiator with Apple and helped hammer out their partnership, which included a provision that the two would “support and defend” the deal against antitrust scrutiny, a top Apple executive testified earlier at the trial.\\n\\n“We pay a proportion of our money based on the value that we see,” Pichai said, including “enhanced promotion of Google search.”\\n\\nThe Justice Department argues that Google knows that most people don’t change their default settings even if other options are available. Earlier in the trial, lead Google litigator John Schmidtlein said the company’s default deals were based strictly on merit and that users can change their settings and opt for another search engine in “a matter of seconds.”\\n\\nPichai said Google built its Chrome browser and Android smartphone operating system to help consumers more easily access the web — and use the company’s search engine “more seamlessly.” Android “has helped bring hundreds of millions of people online,” he said. Google realized “the better you make the web experience, they would use the web more. They would search the web more.”\\n\\nThe 51-year-old CEO has a long history at Google, where he has held several roles, including helping to engineer the Android strategy and helming development of the Chrome browser. Wearing a black suit and standing behind a podium in lieu of sitting, Pichai said Google allows other companies to use the underlying technology for the Chrome browser and Android for free. Microsoft’s Edge browser is based on Google’s technology and hundreds of products use Android, from phones to computers to fitness equipment made by Peloton Interactive Inc., he said.\\n\\nThe government has grilled previous witnesses on why Google, with its substantial lead in market share, needs to pay Apple and others billions of dollars for default status if its product is so good that people would chose it over other offers anyway. The answer, the government has so far suggested, is that Google has used its prime position to extract more money from advertisers — often by making opaque changes to the rules that control the ad auctions in which companies participate.\\n\\nIn emails disclosed as part of the government’s case so far, Pichai was shown to have expressed concern about making Google the default, and favored offering a choice. In 2007, Pichai wrote in internal emails to colleagues that Google’s exclusive deal with Apple had bad “optics” and that they should encourage Apple to offer Yahoo as an option in a pull-down menu. “I don’t think it is a good user experience nor the optics is great for us to be the only provider in the browser,” he wrote, according to an email presented at trial.\\n\\nJudge Amit Mehta isn’t expected to issue a decision until next year, and any resolution to the case is likely to be years away. There will be appeals and a possible second trial to establish a remedy if the Justice Department wins.\\n\\n(Updates with testimony beginning in first paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nGut Check: Is This Poop-Test Startup Just Wellness Theater?

Yahoo Finance Live's Rachelle Akuffo and Akiko Fujita preview the earnings expectations for chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — which is set to report earnings on Tuesday, October 31 — and Apple (AAPL) — reporting on Thursday, November 2.\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: We're about halfway through the third quarter earnings season with 49% of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported results, so far. According to FactSet, 78% of the companies that have reported had actual EPS above estimates, which is just above the five-year moving average.\\n\\nRevenue, on the other hand, is lagging the five-year average with just 62% of companies reporting revenue beats. Still, the index is reporting higher earnings for the third quarter with growth at 2.7% following last week's big tech reports.\\n\\nAccording to FactSet, if this growth rate continues, it will mark the first quarter of year-over-year earnings growth reported by the index since Q3 of 2022. So can the momentum continue? Well, we have a few more big tech companies this week. And Akiko and I each have our eyes on one.\\n\\nSo I'm looking forward to AMD's earnings. They're coming out on Tuesday after the closing bell. It's going to be a lot to digest here because some of the growth that they've seen expectedly in client and data center segments aren't expecting to see versus last year, the same quarter and earnings and revenue decline widely among the analysts that we've seen.\\n\\nBut earlier this month, some positive note here. TD Cowen analyst Matt Ramsay said, after a first half of 2023 characterized by the dramatic shift that we saw in generative AI, we view the headwinds as beginning to ease as evidenced by the company's 3Q guidance issued prior to the earnings call.\\n\\nSo certainly, looking more bullish here. And keeping in mind, obviously, the chip industry, it is cyclical. But a lot of what I'll be looking for on the earnings call is how margins have been faring because those have been under pressure. We'll be looking to see if the worst of that margin pressure is actually behind it. And something interesting here, Cathie Wood's ARKQ ETF on Friday buying more than $5 billion in AMD ahead of this earnings season.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nI'll also be looking to see what's been happening with global PC shipments because a research from Gartner shows that those have fallen 9% in the third quarter. But they are expected to recover in Q4. So I'll be looking for any signs of that recovery in what we see in the forward guidance coming out of AMD, as well, Akiko.\\n\\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. AMD, always a good indicator of not just chip demand, but, overall, as you point out, the devices demand, as well. The stock down just slightly today ahead of those earnings results. But it is up more than 45% on the year. And to your point, this is a company, as with many other chip makers, that have gone through a bit of a show-me period here, especially on what that demand and revenue picture will look like, specifically, on AI.\\n\\nSo certainly, expecting a lot of commentary on that front, as well. Apple, the other big one, of course, that we are watching reporting later this week. And this is an interesting one, Rachelle. Because, yes, it is about the iPhone demand. And we're going to get to that in just a bit. But it's also about the overall health of the consumer. We often look to Apple as a bit of a bellwether in some ways about where the consumer is willing to shell out, especially with those high-end devices.\\n\\nNow, worth noting that Apple makes up roughly 7% of the S&P 500, which is why we're watching it so closely. The company has already indicated they expect another quarter of declining sales. So if, in fact, that's where it comes in in terms of these latest results, the Q4 results for Apple, that would mark a full fiscal year of sales decline. Certainly, not good for the company.\\n\\nInvestors certainly going to be looking also for what that China demand is going to be looking like because that makes up roughly 10% of the overall revenue for the company. Some commentary coming through from analysts ahead of these results. JP Morgan Samik Chatterjee saying that the seen shorter lead time for the iPhone 15 when you compare it to where the 14 was last year. He doesn't see that as a good indication of demand for the 15.\\n\\nAlso, Tom Forte, DA Davidson-- a friend of the show. We should point out-- says, he doesn't think iPhone sales are necessarily going to be a big catalyst for the stock. Certainly, pointing to the fact that there could be softer demand.\\n\\nSo another stock that we're going to be watching here on a very busy week for earnings.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-apple-154000449.html', 'symbols': ['A1MD34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMD.F', 'AMD.MX', 'AMD.US', 'AMD.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GSPC.INDX'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.993, 'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.895, 'pos': 0.081}}, {'date': '2023-10-30T14:45:22+00:00', 'title': 'S&amp;P 500 rallies ahead of busy week as Apple earnings, Fed decision eyed', 'content': 'Investing.com -- The S&P 500 jumped Monday, led by big tech ahead of the earnings from Apple later this week, and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision due Wednesday.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.3%, the Nasdaq gained 1.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.7% or 558 points.\\n\\nBig tech rallies ahead of Apple earnings\\n\\nBig tech including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) rallied to lift the broader tech sector as investors awaited earnings from Apple.\\n\\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report results for its June quarter - typically a seasonally weak quarter for the company - on Thursday after the market closes, with many Wall Street eager for insight into iPhone sales amid reports of slowing demand.\\n\\nApple is also expected to announce its third-generation Apple Silicon chip later on Monday.\\n\\nGeneral Motors reaches tentative agreement with UAW\\n\\nUnited Auto Workers and General Motors struck a deal Monday, ending a six-week-long strike at Detriot automakers, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources.\\n\\nThe terms agreement are similar to the recent accord signed by Ford and Stellantis with the UAW, including wage hikes and cost of living allowances.\\n\\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) was marginally higher intraday, while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) were in the red.\\n\\nTreasury yields rise ahead of refinancing announcement, Fed meeting\\n\\nTreasury yields rose on Monday as investors awaited the Treasury refunding announcement due Wednesday, which details its plans for note and bond sales.\\n\\nThe recent selloff in Treasuries that has pushed yields to multi-year highs - has been partly attributed by some to the increase in supply of Treasuries.\\n\\n“For Q4, we expect that borrowing projections will be revised down to $745B from $850B in the first cut,” Jefferies said in a note.\\n\\nAs well as the refinancing announcement, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday will also draw close attention amid expectations for a rate pause.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMcDonald’s, SOFI deliver on earnings stage\\n\\nMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) rose more than 2% after the fast-food maker reported quarterly results that beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines as recent price hikes underpinned growth.\\n\\nSoFi Technologies Inc.

To skip reading Warren Buffett\\'s investment strategy and Q2 bets of Berkshire Hathaway, go directly to the 5 Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks for Beginners.\\n\\nThe Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, might not be the wealthiest man in the world, but he’s arguably the most successful investor of our time. However, Warren Buffett does not consider money the greatest investment tool. He once said:\\n\\n“The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself, and it\\'s not taxed at all.”\\n\\nWhat Beginners Can Learn From Buffett\\n\\nStock picks for beginners can be challenging. However, taking lessons from Warren Buffett’s life and investment strategy is valuable for beginners and experts alike. One of the best lessons beginners can learn from Buffett is how to spend money. Despite being one of the richest men in the world, he lives a very simple life. While many people spend money on luxuries such as cars and massive houses, Buffett has only changed three cars in the last two decades. He changed his Lincoln Town Car for a 2006 Cadillac DTS after almost a decade and then replaced his DTS with his current car, the 2014 Cadillac XTS. His frugality means that he now has enough money to buy anything he wants at a whim. Buffett says:\\n\\n\"I have everything in life I want; it\\'s a very simple thing. If there\\'s anything that money could buy that I wanted, I would do it this afternoon without hesitation.\"\\n\\nFrom an investment point of view, one of the first things that beginners can learn from Buffett is to invest in businesses instead of stocks. It means that an investor should pick a business they understand. It will help the investor understand how the business is going and how it will possibly perform in the future.\\n\\nMoreover, Buffett’s most well-known investment strategy is long-term value investing. He chooses stocks with strong fundamentals based on their intrinsic value and keeps them for a long time. He says that a stock is not worth buying if you can\\'t keep it for 10 years.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWarren Buffett is also against diversification. Diversification is not necessarily a bad thing for beginner investors who do not have much backup. Diversification can be beneficial because they won’t lose everything if one of the investments goes completely downhill. However, if Buffett\\'s advice on investing in companies you understand is to be taken into consideration, investing in just a few businesses you know well can be rewarding. In the second quarter, 51% of Berkshire Hathaway was covered by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Buffett has held the stock for almost 7 years.\\n\\nWarren Buffett’s Bets in Q2 2023\\n\\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio was worth $348 billion, up from $325 billion in the first quarter. Given that Buffett doesn’t like to diversify much, his top 10 holdings covered 91% of his 13F portfolio. Berkshire sold out of McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC), and Vitesse Energy, Inc. (NYSE:VTS). He further bought 3 new stocks, increased holdings in 2, and reduced holdings in 5.\\n\\nOne company that Warren Buffett is constantly increasing his holdings in is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Buffett started buying the company shares in 2022 when the oil prices were hitting their all-time highs due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Buffett now owns nearly 26% of the company. However, he mentioned that he is not looking to control the company because he thinks that the company is already in good hands. Despite the recent fluctuations in the oil and gas market, Buffett is still not bearish on the sector. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) are two of the top ten stocks held by Berkshire Hathaway.\\n\\nAccording to Tipranks, Berkshire Hathaway has gained 98.31% in the last decade and the 3-year annualized return of the hedge fund is around 8.5%. Some of the best Warren Buffett’s stock picks for beginners include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).\\n\\nIf you like passive income and investing in dividend stocks, you can check out the 12 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett. 13 Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks for Beginners\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nFor this article, we chose 13 stocks for beginners from Warren Buffett\\'s 13F portfolio that had the highest number of hedge fund investors according to Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds.\\n\\nBest Warren Buffett Stock Picks for Beginners\\n\\n13.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy.

After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.\\n\\nWe should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years. Meanwhile, you collect the 4.5% annual dividend, which is currently a better yield than long-term treasuries.\"\\n\\n8.

(NASDAQ:TMUS)’s revenue was down 1.2% YoY to $19.25 billion and missed the estimates by $120 million.\\n\\nFor FY 2023, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) upped its guidance. The company expects net customer additions to be between 5.7 million and 5.9 million, compared to the prior outlook of 5.6 million to 5.9 million. Core adjusted EBITDA expectations are between $29.0 billion and $29.2 billion, up from $28.9 billion to $29.2 billion. Furthermore, T-Mobile US, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the best Warren Buffett stock picks for beginners.\\n\\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“During the quarter we initiated positions in two new names: T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Gilead Sciences. T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.\\n\\nThis combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.\\n\\nGiven the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.\\n\\nWe have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”\\n\\n6.

To skip our introduction to micro cap investing, some benefits, and potential risks, you can skip ahead to 5 Best Micro Cap Stocks To Invest In.\\n\\nDepending on who you ask, it can be argued that the stock market is divided into two worlds. In what might be characteristic of the Power Law, a few stocks often dominate most of the conversation. Yet, while big companies in nearly every sector, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), dominate media and analyst attention, there are thousands of other firms that are also publicly traded, and their small share prices, coupled with modest valuations, create chances of spectacular returns.\\n\\nOne of the smallest categories of stocks measured through their market capitalization is the micro cap category. These stocks are often also called penny stocks, and their size coupled with limited public interest also leaves them out of the traditional sphere of media coverage. At the same time, the shares of such companies are often quite risky especially during rough economic times since capital always flows to the safety of stability if there are broader macroeconomic concerns about the business environment. Big and mega cap stocks are representative of firms that have millions and billions of dollars in assets, cash, and securities. This provides their business operations a buffer if sales drop, and by extension, stabilizes the stock price.\\n\\nOn the flip side, micro cap companies do not have such sizeable assets, and their share price performance depends on the companies' ability to grow business and capture market share from rivals. Naturally, investors are more hesitant to pile into micro cap stocks unless there are underlying strengths that can serve as future share price catalysts.\\n\\nAdditionally, micro cap stocks also come with the risks of low liquidity and potential frauds, which leave some of the most vulnerable investors, particularly in the retail sphere, at risk of significant losses. One of the most common stock market frauds is a pump and dump, which sees nefarious actors team together to buy micro cap or similar stocks in bulk. After this forces the price upwards, as other market participants also buy the stock since it's growing, the shares are sold.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nResearch from Concordia University shows that small cap and micro cap stocks tend to be a market out performers after the economy has exited a trough. However, before a downturn, large cap stocks tend to hold their ground better. In terms of percentage returns, from peak to troughs for the business cycle between December 2007 and June 2009, the S&P500's 38.1% drop was slightly lower than a small cap stock portfolio's 40.15% drop. However, it's the recovery period where small cap stocks truly shine, as the data shows that in the fifteen post recessionary periods starting from November 1927 to June 1999, small cap stocks delivered better returns than their large cap stocks fourteen times.\\n\\nTherefore, there is some merit to selecting micro cap stocks for an investment, if one is ready to accept the risks. And since their performance is tightly linked with the economy, data on this front should also provide some insight. The economy and interest rates have dominated the conversation for more than a year now since rapid interest rate hikes to combat inflation have changed the broader stock market environment when it comes to investing. The latest bit of economic news came in the form of the S&P Global US Flash PMI, which rose to 51 for October and beat its previous high that was set in July. A reading below 50 signals an economic contraction, and the results showed that despite aggressive interest rate hikes, business output remained resilient.\\n\\nCrucially, the PMI reading comes just days before a highly anticipated data release by the Commerce Department for the state of the U.S. economy during Q3 2023. Polls conducted by Reuters and Bloomberg suggest that the economy might have grown the fastest for the third quarter over the past two years, after the impacts of the coronavirus lock down and rapid inflation start to dissipate.\\n\\nSo, as economic news provides optimism about the future and the stock market, we took a look at micro cap stocks that are popular among hedge funds. The top three hedge fund micro cap stock picks are Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX), uniQure N.V. (NASDAQ:QURE), and KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\n2023 is shaping up to be a year where firms are prioritizing their environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, practices and investing more in sustainable projects. For some organizations, this year is as business as usual but for others, it may be a year of change and disruption. According to research compiled by S&P Global, around $8.4 trillion in US investment assets last year were retained by companies that incorporated ESG into their business decisions. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated in a research report that asset managers around the world are expected to raise their ESG-related assets under management to $33.9 trillion by 2026, up from $18.4 trillion in 2021. The $33.9 trillion amount will represent 21.5% of assets under management held by asset managers. In the US, ESG-oriented assets under management would reach around $10.5 trillion in 2026, while in Europe, it would jump to $19.6 trillion.\\n\\nHistorically, organizations allocated their energy and capital to enhance their financial picture to retain a competitive edge against competitors. But with the passage of time, investors are keen to put their capital into socially conscious organizations. In the mid-1990s, the concept of the triple bottom line was born when entrepreneur and Volans co-founder John Elkington invented the word to evaluate the sustainability performance of corporations in America. But what is the triple bottom line? Harvard Business School defined it as:\\n\\nThe triple bottom line is a business concept that states firms should commit to measuring their social and environmental impact—in addition to their financial performance—rather than solely focusing on generating profit, or the standard “bottom line.”\\n\\nBloomberg said this year that ESG assets may hit a $50 trillion market size by 2025, which will represent over a third of the expected $140.5 trillion in total international assets under management.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“Around the world, fund managers are convinced of the link between ESG and a company\\'s shareholder value, and this link is a key input for investment decisions,” Bloomberg said.\\n\\nThe research also highlighted that 71% of global business leaders say that “eventually” no investment strategy will be considered without ESG. Bloomberg also projected that an investment of roughly $2.1 trillion is required in the energy transition from 2022 to 2025. The amount includes electrified heat, energy storage, and nuclear power, in addition to renewable energy projects.\\n\\nMarket regulators are implementing tough benchmarks to enhance ESG funds’ reporting. Not only North America and Europe have adopted stringent requirements, but Asia and Australia are also imposing strategies for ESG reporting, the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum said. The forum also added that Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore have all offered guidance to standard disclosures on the ESG integration with the investment procedures. Canadian and the European Union regulators are moving a step ahead with fund classification.\\n\\nConsidering the importance of ESG, we decided to take a look at some of the best ESG stocks to buy now.

This week’s list includes Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL and Nvidia NVDA.\\n\\nQ3 Earnings: Tech Sector in Focus\\n\\nA big contributing factor to the market\\'s loss of momentum over the last three months is rising interest rates and the \\'higher-for-longer\\' view of Fed policy. The interest rate issue is an even more significant headwind for Tech stocks, given their perceived \\'long duration\\' status.\\n\\nYou can see this in the chart below, which shows the three-month performance of the S&P 500 index and the Zacks Tech sector. The chart also shows the performance of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet over the same period.\\n\\nAs you can see here, the Zacks Tech sector (blue line at the bottom; down – 11.5%) has lagged the broader market (red line, second from the bottom, down -9.7%), with Microsoft (green line, down -2.7%), Amazon (orange line, down -3.9%) and Alphabet (purple line, down -8.7%) doing better.\\n\\nThe relative outperformance of Microsoft and Amazon is a reflection of these mega-cap companies\\' earnings power that was reconfirmed in their quarterly results. Alphabet\\'s results were no less impressive, but the market is putting a premium on momentum in cloud and AI. Alphabet appears to be fumbling a bit on that front.\\n\\nThe \\'Big 7 Tech Players\\' group is on track to achieve +49% earnings growth in 2023 Q3 on +12.2% higher revenues.\\n\\nStrong Q3 results from these mega-cap Tech players, of which only Apple and Nvidia have yet to report results at this stage, are a big reason why the aggregate Q3 earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 index has turned positive in recent days.\\n\\nQ3 earnings for the S&P 500 index on a blended basis, meaning combining the actual earnings that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, is now expected to increase +1.2% from the same period last year, with equal growth (+1.2%) expected in revenues. If we exclude the contribution from these \\'Big 7 Tech Players\\', Q3 earnings for the remainder of the index would be down -5.7% from the same period last year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs we all know by now, the group\\'s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that was in the process of getting adjusted last year and this year. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to resume \\'regular/normal\\' growth next year, but a lot of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\\n\\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q3 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +18.6% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues.\\n\\nAs was the case with the \\'Big 7 Tech Players,\\' the overall Tech sector has been dealing with the pulled forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in the preceding quarter (2023 Q2) after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\\n\\nThis big-picture view of the \\'Big 7 players\\' and the sector as a whole shows that the worst of the growth challenge is shifting into the rearview mirror.\\n\\nThe Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard\\n\\nIncluding all the earnings reports through Friday, October 27th, we now have Q3 results from 246 S&P 500 members, or 49.2% of the index\\'s total membership. Total Q3 earnings for these companies are up +6% from the same period last year on +2.1% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.2% beating revenue estimates.\\n\\nWe have another super busy reporting docket this week with more than 1100 companies reporting Q3 results, including 159 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Apple, which reports after the market\\'s close on Thursday.\\n\\nCompanies are comfortably beating consensus EPS estimates but coming up a bit short on the revenue beats percentages. This becomes clearer when we look at the \\'blended\\' beats percentage for Q3, which shows the proportion of these 246 index members that have beaten both EPS and revenue estimates.\\n\\nThe Earnings Big Picture\\n\\nLooking at 2023 Q3 as a whole, the expectation currently is of S&P 500 earnings growing by +1.2% from the same period last year on +1.2% higher revenues. This would follow the -7.1% decline on +1.1% higher revenues in 2023 Q2. Please note that earnings growth has turned positive for the first time after staying in negative territory for three back-to-back quarters.\\n\\nThe earnings growth picture for the quarter improves further on an ex-Energy basis (+6.6% vs. +1.2%).\\n\\nLook at current expectations for next year and the year after to understand the disconnect between the reality of current bottom-up aggregate earnings estimates and the seemingly never-ending worries about an impending economic downturn. That said, most economic analysts have been steadily lowering their recessionary odds in recent months.\\n\\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>The Earnings Picture Continues to Improve\\n\\nWhy Haven\\'t You Looked at Zacks\\' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P\\'s +6.2 average gain per year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Performing Dividend Stocks in 2023.\\n\\nMarket sentiment is a dynamic and ever-shifting phenomenon where the focus of investment frequently shifts from one type to another over time. While the technology-focused NASDAQ has posted a year-to-date gain of 21.2%, it has experienced a recent decline, losing 3.81% of its value over the past month. This demonstrates the ever-changing nature of the investment landscape. For this reason, investors tend to prefer dividend-paying companies because these firms have a reputation for producing consistent earnings, even when the economy experiences slower growth. In addition to this, companies that increase their dividends have shown better performance than the overall S&P 500 index historically, offering reliable income growth across different market sizes and industry sectors. These qualities are always attractive but become especially valuable during turbulent market conditions.\\n\\nAlso read: Dividend Capture Strategy: 10 High Yield Stocks To Buy in November\\n\\nDan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, spoke about dividend stocks and their underperformance this year in one of his columns. Here are some comments from the analyst:\\n\\n“Overall, dividend performance this year has been lackluster. The great thing about dividend investing is that it’s got a great track record. Plus, investors get paid while they wait for performance to turn around.”\\n\\nDividends have made up about a third of the market’s returns since 1960. However, it is important to note that not all dividend investment methods are the same, and there are key distinctions between those aiming for high dividend yields and those focusing on dividend growth. In the past, stocks that consistently increase their dividends have proven to be strong performers in terms of providing reliable income, especially during periods of high market volatility. According to a report by ProShares, in 2008, the S&P 500 experienced a significant decline of 37%, whereas the Dividend Aristocrats, companies known for consistently increasing their dividends, saw a comparatively smaller loss of 21.9%. This outperformance can be attributed to the competitive edge, cautious management, and dependable dividend payments of these companies.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGiven the preference of investors for dividend-paying stocks because of their capacity to generate income, numerous companies around the world have chosen to maintain their dividend payouts at a consistent level. According to data from fund manager Janus Henderson, approximately 88% of companies worldwide either raised or maintained their dividend payments during the second quarter of 2023. This trend has led to a total of $568.1 billion in dividends distributed globally since the beginning of the year. The report also mentioned that in the US, 98% of the tracked companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at existing levels, surpassing the global average.\\n\\nDespite an overall decline in the performance of dividend stocks this year, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are some of the best-performing dividend stocks this year, generating positive returns for shareholders. In this article, we will discuss some other best-performing dividend stocks in 2023. 12 Best Performing Dividend Stocks in 2023\\n\\nOur Methodology:\\n\\nFor this list, we looked at the top-performing stocks of 2023 and focused on dividend-paying stocks that have shown significant growth in their share prices this year. We began with a pool of fifty companies, narrowed it down by considering their share price increases, and ultimately selected the top 12 dividend stocks with the highest share price gains as of October 27, arranging them in ascending order of performance.\\n\\n12.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) (U.S.), a global software company, was the Fund’s top contributor for the fiscal year, with its share price rising primarily after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results. More recently, Oracle announced fiscal first-quarter results, which were in line with consensus expectations. The drivers of the core business are performing well, in our view, and management expressed confidence that annual revenue growth will accelerate as planned based on demand trajectory and its strong bookings trends. For the quarter, total revenue increased 8% in constant currency (9% reported), and operating income grew 12% with margins showing improvement. Cloud and support revenue grew 11% in constant currency, powered by Fusion +20% and Netsuite +21%. The “strategic back office cloud” is now up to $6.9 billion in run-rate revenue. Infrastructure cloud and support revenue grew 14% in constant currency, powered by infrastructure cloud services +72% ex-legacy hosting services to $5.6 billion in run-rate revenue. Momentum is continuing to build as Oracle signed several deals for its cloud business greater than $1 billion in total value during the quarter and booked an additional $1.5 billion in the first week of the second quarter. We continue to believe Oracle is an attractive holding and undervalued due to our perception of its intrinsic value.”\\n\\n11.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.\\n\\nAt the age of 93, Warren Buffett's net worth has reached $116.2 billion. Buffett has consistently prioritized a deep understanding of a company's inner workings before making an investment. His investment strategy revolves around identifying businesses with robust and scalable models, poised for expansion and market dominance, ultimately benefiting from the resulting increase in stock value. Buffett ranks among the highest-earning hedge fund managers, thanks to the consistent returns his investments have historically yielded through Berkshire Hathaway. The renowned investor possesses a remarkable track record with his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has delivered an annualized return of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022. This figure is nearly double the 9.9% annualized return of the S&P 500. Lately, the billionaire has emerged as one of the most proactive hedge fund managers, capitalizing on the high-interest rate environment. Bolstered by a substantial cash reserve of $147 billion at the close of June, the iconic investor has been actively seeking out investments capable of delivering significant returns, particularly with short-term rates exceeding 5%. To illustrate, he started betting on the housing market during the June quarter, acquiring stakes in three construction companies. These include NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).\\n\\nOn the other hand, however, the investor has started shifting his perspective on the banking sector. Starting from 2020, the 'Oracle of Omaha' has divested from several financial institutions that have experienced significant declines this year: Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) (-5%), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) (-14%), M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) (-23%), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) (-28%), and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) (-30%). As of the end of June, the market value of Berkshire's holdings in banking, financial, and insurance stocks stood at $67 billion, with an initial cost base of $24 billion. This segment of the conglomerate's stock portfolio was valued at $102 billion with a $40 billion cost base at the close of 2019. Notably, it comprised only 19% of Berkshire's total portfolio value in June, a substantial drop from 41%, highlighting the extent of Berkshire's divestitures during this period.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBuffett's shift in stance on banks emerged in April when he expressed concern that some banks were inflating their earnings and misleading investors by valuing their assets at historical cost instead of their current market value. He also criticized them for mismanaging their assets and liabilities, such as using immediately withdrawable customer deposits to acquire long-term bonds. It's important to note that Buffett and his team haven't completely abandoned investments in banks, and they have not been immune to the challenges faced this year. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) remains Berkshire's second-largest holding after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though its stock has experienced a 23% decline since the beginning of the year.\\n\\nWith these details in mind, we'll be looking at some stocks that are favored by Warren Buffett as long-term stock options. Some notable names on this list include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.

(NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter.\\xa0Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”\\n\\n9.

Here’s what you need to know.\\n\\nCheck for updates\\n\\n“If you need a new phone and want to save some money, you should definitely consider buying a preowned handset,” says Tom Paton, the founder of Green Smartphones, a comparison website.\\n\\nHe adds that refurbished phones are typically devices that have been used for a year or two and then traded in by someone who is upgrading to the latest device. “These handsets are tested to make sure they are still responsive and have good battery life, before having any wear and tear fixed. Then the device is sold with a warranty, just like a new phone.”\\n\\nWhen looking for a refurbished or secondhand phone, it is crucial to check that the particular model is still getting software updates from the manufacturer, as it is not safe to use a phone that isn’t receiving security fixes.\\n\\nMany Android phones only get three to four years of updates from the moment they are released – not when you buy the handset – but the best offer five to 10 years of support, including some Samsung, Google and Fairphone devices. Apple typically offers up to seven years for its iPhone models.\\n\\nThat makes Apple’s iPhones from the last three years – alongside recent Samsung Galaxy S21, S22 and S23 models and Google Pixel 6 or 7 phones from the last two years – among the best bets when it comes to refurbished models.\\n\\nHow much should I pay?\\n\\nRefurbished phones come in two different types and various grades. The best is “manufacturer-refurbished”, which essentially matches a new phone. However, these typically cost most and are sometimes in short supply.\\n\\nAn iPhone 12 Pro, for example, costs about £150 more refurbished from Apple than from a third party at the time of writing.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRetailer or third-party refurbished devices are secondhand phones that have been tested to check they work and repaired if necessary. They vary in condition and are often sold in grades. Here is what you can roughly expect.\\n\\nGrade A Virtually identical in condition to a new phone without marks on the outside, often with the original box and accessories. These are frequently customer returns rather than trade-ins.\\n\\nGrade B In full working order but not in perfect condition, usually with light scratches, dents or nicks. They may come with original accessories.\\n\\nGrade C Visibly worn but in full working order, typically sold without the original accessories.\\n\\nGrade D Also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.\\n\\nWhere should I buy?\\n\\nThe secondhand phone market is growing at a rapid pace, with many new and established retailers about.\\n\\nManufacturer-refurbished phones can be bought straight from the maker, including Samsung and Apple in the UK.\\n\\nThere are several high street retailers such as CeX and Game that sell secondhand and refurbished phones that come with various warranties. The secondhand phone market is growing.Photograph: Gary Hider/Alamy\\n\\nEnvirofone and musicMagpie are two longstanding online sellers of refurbished devices, and have various grades and deals available, each with a 12-month warranty.\\n\\nBack Market is one of the newer offerings acting as a marketplace for small refurbishers, allowing you to pick and choose phones and who they come from. Back Market says it vets sellers and monitors for quality, but it is still worth checking reviews for the individual refurbishers on the site before buying.\\n\\nFinally, eBay plays host to many sellers of secondhand and refurbished devices but as an open marketplace, it is crucial you research the seller before buying. Check their reviews and feedback, and scrutinise the listings carefully.\\n\\nWhat should I check for?\\n\\nThere are a few things to check when your phone arrives.\\n\\nBattery health Batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles, or about two years of charging every night. Has it been replaced?\\n\\nCharging port Check for signs of damage, as the charging port could be one of the first parts to break.\\n\\nButtons Check that all the buttons work without pressing too hard, as a faulty button could render the phone very difficult to use and may be expensive to fix.\\n\\nNetwork locks Check the phone works with your mobile phone provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to a certain network and must be unlocked before being used on another.\\n\\nUnauthorised parts Not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can cause problems.\\n\\nIt is also worth checking that the phone you are buying isn’t stolen by checking its 15-digit identification number, called the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity), against a database of stolen phones through a service such as CheckMEND or similar.\\n\\nWhat protections do I get? There are a few things to bear in mind when buying a refurbished phone.Photograph: PhotoAlto/Alamy\\n\\nYour rights when buying a refurbished phone from a business are similar to when buying new.\\n\\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, you have 30 days to return the phone if it isn’t as described or fit for purpose, and if the phone develops a fault within six months, it is up to the retailer to prove it was fault-free when sold.\\n\\nRetailers will typically provide a 12-month or longer warranty, too, and you may still be covered by the original manufacturer’s warranty, if there is any remaining.', 'link': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/best-refurbished-phone-070008937.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.993, 'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.09}}, {'date': '2023-10-30T05:56:58+00:00', 'title': \"Futures higher, HSBC share buybacks, Evergrande reprieve - what's moving markets\", 'content': 'Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point higher, with investors preparing for a busy week of central bank decisions, economic data, and company earnings.

HSBC announces fresh share buybacks\\n\\nHSBC has unveiled an extra $3 billion in share buybacks, bringing its total returns to shareholders this year to $7B, as the lender said it has reaped the benefits from higher interest rates.\\n\\nThe move came as the bank reported profit before tax in the third quarter of $7.7B, missing analysts\\' estimates of $8.1B, but jumping from $4.5B in the corresponding period last year.

We remain positive on this market-leading managed care company with revenue twice that of its closest competitor. The company continues to gain Medicare Advantage share given attractive and stable benefits and could achieve greater profitability as medical management is deployed across newer, higher acuity lives. We believe UnitedHealth has a broad number of levers at its command and can sustainably deliver 13% to 16% annual long-term earnings growth.”\\n\\n12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\\n\\nWe saw 112 hedge funds long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the second quarter. Their total stake value was $6.9 billion.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that is based in Santa Clara, California.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“Among our top contributors were\\xa0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”\\n\\n11.

Mobility gross bookings of $15 billion grew 44% over the last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings, also $15 billion, were up 12% from last year and accelerated through the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million, up $593 million year over year, significantly beat management’s $660-$700 million guidance and the company generated $549 million of free cash flow versus a loss last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 2Q Gross Bookings (13%-17% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $800- $850 million).\\n\\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.4 billion in Freight revenue for 1Q23), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $84 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”\\n\\n6.

Not so this time, however, as investors are more focused on Apple Inc.’s Thursday earnings report than the central bank’s Wednesday interest-rate decision.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nIsrael Latest: Biden, Netanyahu Plan to Talk Within Hours Canada Plans College Crackdown Amid Foreign Student Troubles GM Hit With More Strikes While Stellantis Reaches Deal With UAW How This Israel-Hamas Conflict Is Like Nothing That’s Happened Before Israel Warns of ‘Long’ War as Invasion of Gaza Strip Begins\\n\\nThere’s reason for concern about Apple. The world’s most valuable company, representing 7.2% of the S&P 500 Index, is facing a slump in smartphone sales, and one of its main suppliers is under investigation in China. A revenue decline is expected for a fourth consecutive quarter, its longest streak in more than two decades.\\n\\nOther big tech companies have seen their shares drop after posting solid earnings this month, so investors may not be forgiving if Apple shows weakness. The stock is already struggling, on pace for a third-straight losing month, which hasn’t happened since the middle of last year’s selloff. The latest rout has erased about $460 billion in market value from a company previously worth about $3 trillion.\\n\\n“If the earnings quality deteriorates for Big Tech companies — which has been a big factor in supporting stocks this year — then that gives the stock bulls one less branch to cling onto,” Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research, said in an interview.\\n\\nApple is big enough on its own to influence S&P 500 returns, but it can also ripple out to other stocks. The market is shaky, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Index having shed about 10% from their July peaks. Earnings reports from the so-called Magnificent Seven technology companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple, Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — drove the declines after powering the surge in stocks through July.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOf course, the Fed’s decision is still big news. While traders broadly expect the central bank to hold rates steady, they’ll be listening carefully to what Chair Jerome Powell says at his press conference afterward, looking for hints on the path forward and the economic outlook.\\n\\nOther big events are also on the calendar in the coming days. Just hours before the Wednesday rates decision, the US Treasury will announce plans for selling bonds and notes to refinance the government’s maturing debt, known as refunding. Another ramp up in sales could send yields soaring again and renew pressure on growth stocks, whose present value of future profits are worth less as rates rise.\\n\\nBut tech earnings have played an outsized role in share price movements recently, generally for the worse. Three of the five biggest technology-related companies to report so far have fallen the day after results.\\n\\nTesla’s stock tumbled more than 9% on Oct. 19, the day after the electric-vehicle maker missed profit and sales estimates. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk dialed back growth expectations amid slumping demand and rising interest rates. Shares of Google-owner Alphabet sank nearly 10% on Oct. 25, a day after the company posted a smaller-than-expected profit in its cloud-services business that management blamed on customers reining in budgets.\\n\\nHowever, Amazon.com and Microsoft both rallied in the wake of their earnings, which were both fueled by strong results in their cloud-computing businesses.\\n\\nFor investors, the problem is that the biggest tech companies have been responsible for the bulk of the S&P 500’s gains this year, helping to offset weakness in real estate, financial and health care stocks. So bulls have to figure out where gains will come from if Big Tech stocks keep sputtering.\\n\\nThe thing is, beyond Tesla the biggest tech companies haven’t really reported bad earnings. Take Alphabet. The search giant is seeing a recovery in the digital-advertising business that dominates its revenue, fueling better-than-expected profit and sales. Or Meta, which beat profit and revenue estimates, but the stock still fell after Chief Financial Officer Susan Li’s comments about economic uncertainty on the company’s earnings call.\\n\\nThe jittery reactions are a sign that after this year’s runup, stocks are priced for perfection, making any whiff of weakness a cause to sell, according to Eric Beiley, executive managing director of wealth management at Steward Partners Global Advisory.\\n\\n“I’m concerned about the risk of higher-for-longer rates, which has put a ceiling on investing in Big Tech because there are fears that bigger stock declines are coming,” he said. Beiley used the latest pullback to buy shares of Amazon.com but is still waiting for Apple’s and Alphabet’s multiples drop further.\\n\\nGoing into earnings season, the Nasdaq 100 was trading around 24 times projected profits, above the average of 21 times over the past decade. Five of the seven biggest tech companies were priced above 28.\\n\\n“Clients feel their losses more than they appreciate their gains,” explained Dana D’Auria, co-CIO at Envestnet Inc. “But if concern grows in the stock market, then Big Tech can still inevitably be a beneficiary since they’re known as risk-off, defensive play.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto’s Epic Fall X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter’s Business The Business of Children’s Books in This New Era of Book Banning A Complicated Billionaire Shoots for the Moon on The Businessweek Show The War That Broke Social Media\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-traders-face-pivotal-week-140000465.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'TL0.F', 'TL0.XETRA', 'TSLA.MX', 'TSLA.US', 'TSLA34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.978, 'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.109}}, {'date': '2023-10-29T13:39:35+00:00', 'title': 'Dan Niles looking to re-short Tesla, Apple: Insider trades &amp; hedge funds weekly', 'content': 'Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest insider trades and institutional investor headlines you may have missed last week: Corvex doubles stake in Southwest Gas, Ancora supports Forward Air’s decision to terminate Omni Logistics merger, Satori\\'s Dan Niles covers shorts in Tesla and Apple and looks to re-short higher, and top brass buys at Truist Financial, Nasdaq, and Commercial Metals.\\n\\nInvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.\\n\\nCorvex doubles stake in Southwest Gas, seeks possible sale of utility business\\n\\nCorvex Management LP, a hedge fund, more than doubled its stake in Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX), disclosed at the end of the June quarter - to 4,153,717 shares, or 5.8% of the company.\\n\\nCorvex says it aims to discuss potential strategies to maximize the company\\'s value with the board, particularly its core utility franchises and Centuri Group investment. Corvex says that, while it supports Southwest\\'s plan to separate Centuri, it believes Southwest Gas seems to be trading at or below its currently authorized rate base. It says that the implied valuation represents a \"deep discount to underlying value, market comps, and recent transactions\" and suggested the company may need to address this if that disconnect persists. Corvex added that \"similar assets trade at a 1.5-2.0x rate base.\"\\n\\nCorvex also believes Southwest’s ambitious $2 billion capital plan \"clearly does not make sense if growth capital results in a market valuation less than cost.\"\\n\\nThe hedge fund said it expects to engage with Southwest on ways to enhance shareholder value, including by improving earned returns on capital, further restructuring, or an outright sale of the company.\\n\\nAncora supports Forward Air’s decision to seek termination of the Omni Logistics merger\\n\\nAncora Holdings Group, a leading shareholder of Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ:FWRD), backed Forward Air\\'s recently disclosed position that Omni Logistics has violated the terms of their merger agreement, first announced in mid-August.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“In light of this, we – and presumably a critical mass of our fellow shareholders – fully support leadership’s decision to explore a termination of the merger agreement,” said Ancora.\\n\\nThe stock took a huge hit after the merger\\'s August announcement, with Ancora and other key shareholders opposing the deal and three former Forward Air executives and current shareholders filing a lawsuit to block the deal last month.\\n\\nDespite a judge dissolving a restraining order related to the merger, Forward Air accuses Omni of not meeting certain obligations in the merger agreement, and said it will not be obligated to close.\\n\\nSatori\\'s Dan Niles covers shorts in Tesla and Apple and looks to re-short higher\\n\\nSatori Fund’s Dan Niles stated on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he has covered his short positions in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) but is eyeing opportunities to re-short at higher levels.\\n\\nTesla\\'s stock has been slumping recently following worse-than-expected Q3 deliveries and earnings results.

Similarly, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported revenue and EPS beats – but the Google parent missed significantly on cloud revenues, coming in at $8.41 billion compared to analysts\\' expectations of $8.6 billion.\\n\\nThe exception was Microsoft (MSFT) which beat on the top and bottom lines, winning on cloud with its Azure business, topping expectations for both revenue and growth.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) badly missed Wall Street estimates.

REUTERS/File Photos\\n\\nIt\\'s not that these earnings were overall a disappointment, exactly, they were just a dose of reality for a market that had been overly optimistic about AI. Still, Amazon stock is up more than 50% year-to-date, while Microsoft stock is up nearly 40% in that time frame.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut the macroeconomic environment is getting tougher. Interest rates are high, raising capital costs while making sure bet investment like CDs increasingly appealing. The consumer\\'s in a tenuous position, as student loan payments have resumed, gas costs are rising, mortgage rates are approaching 8%, and inflation hasproven to be sticky.\\n\\nAdditionally, AI, while an eventual tailwind, has not yet been fully monetized in any way, shape or form. That process is going to take time. Take Oracle (ORCL) — the SaaS heavyweight has no shortage of demand for its AI services, but can\\'t get enough Nvidia (NVDA) chips to train and deploy those services.\\n\\nThe story is far from Oracle\\'s alone. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon all do business with Nvidia. The e-commerce giant\\'s CEO Andy Jassy said on its earnings call that the company is looking for ways its cloud service AWS can further monetize its services.\\n\\nFor investors, it depends if you\\'re taking the long-term view or the nearer-term view.\\n\\n\"Long-term Investors shouldn’t pay much attention to these kinds of moves,\" GraniteShares CEO and founder Will Rhind told Yahoo Finance.\"Interest rates are most likely at the top of the cycle, and the economy is still in pretty good shape.\"\\n\\nHowever, in times like these, \"it is important for investors to be exposed to quality companies in the market, that are demonstrating growth and sustainability in earnings,\" said Rhind.\\n\\nFor those looking at the near to medium term, try to stave off instincts to follow the herd blindly.\\n\\n\"When you have a stock like Google go down 10%, it sets off a vicious deleveraging cycle where investors are forced to sell companies they have high conviction in to cover margin calls,\" Spear Invest founder and CIO Ivana Delevska told Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nBut not all moves are equal; quality companies like Google may be lumped in with the fire sales, but it doesn\\'t mean there are issues with its fundamentals.\\n\\nHistorically, Nasdaq corrections have been tied to some key moments, from the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a reason why we prefer broad market rallies to narrow ones.

Here’s what you need to know to start your week.\\n\\nFederal Reserve meeting\\n\\nInvestors will be turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Wednesday, eager to hear policymakers\\' views on the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.\\n\\nMost investors are betting that the Fed is done tightening after Chair Jerome Powell said that rising long-term yields reduce the need for further rate increases, though some believe another hike could come when the central bank meets again in December.\\n\\nAny indications that the Fed intends to keep rates around current levels through next year could bolster bets on further upside in Treasury yields, whose climb to their highest levels in more 15 years has contributed to a sharp sell-off in the S&P500.\\n\\nThe index has fallen more than 10% since hitting a year-high in late July, though is still up nearly 8% on the year.\\n\\nNonfarm payrolls data\\n\\nThe key piece of economic data this week will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are expecting more moderate jobs growth of 182,000, which is still consistent with a robust labor market.\\n\\nThe unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.8%, while wage growth is expected to ease to 4% year-on-year, which would mark a post-pandemic period low. This could help bolster the Fed’s view that price pressures are easing and that it doesn\\'t need to raise interest rates any further.\\n\\nAhead of Friday’s data, market participants will be looking at data on third-quarter employment costs on Tuesday for signs that wage growth is moderating.\\n\\nEarnings\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tops the bill in what is set to be another busy week of U.S. corporate earnings, with the iPhone maker reporting on Thursday.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nShares of Apple, the largest company by market value, have helped drive equity indexes higher this year along with shares of other megacap U.S. tech and growth companies.\\n\\nThird quarter earnings season has seen disappointments from some Big Tech names, with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slumping after their respective reports. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is down 11% from its high, though still up nearly 30% on the year.\\n\\nConsumers\\' spending habits will also be in the spotlight with other companies set to report include McDonald\\'s (NYSE:MCD) on Monday, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) on Tuesday, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) on Wednesday, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) on Thursday.\\n\\nBank of England\\n\\nThe Bank of England is to hold its penultimate meeting of the year on Thursday, where officials will need to decide whether to resume raising interest rates, having kept them on hold in September after 14 hikes in a row.\\n\\nInvestors are expecting the BoE to keep rates on hold at a 15-year high of 5.25%, while leaving the door open to further hikes if necessary.

Google antitrust case shakes out remains to be seen, but one thing it’s exposed is just how much the company is willing to pay to be the default search option across devices and platforms. That, of course, is information that Google wants kept private—it argues that disclosure will hurt its ability to negotiate contracts—but the judge in the case, Amit Mehta, wants greater openness in the trial and has ordered that certain numbers be revealed.\\n\\nAs a result, we now know the amount Google paid to be the default search engine in various browsers, phones, and platforms—in one particular year, at least. According to testimony on Friday by Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior executive responsible for search and advertising at Google, the tech giant paid $26.3 billion to other companies for the privilege in 2021. The payments for the defaults, Raghavan added, were the company’s biggest cost.\\n\\nThe sum is staggering, but seems less so when compared to the revenue that Google earned from search advertising that same year: $146.4 billion.\\n\\nWhen approached by Fortune, Google pointed to its trial response, in which Kent Walker, president of global affairs, argues that “our success comes down to the quality of our products, not the quantity of our contracts.”\\n\\nBut, obviously, Google bids on the default settings because they do matter, as spokesperson Peter Schottenfels acknowledged to the New York Times. And as Walker writes: “Browser makers like Apple and Mozilla choose to feature a default search engine. They open competition for the default and pick the best search provider for their users. We compete hard for that placement, so that users can easily access Google Search.”\\n\\nThe question at hand is whether the deals Google has struck with Apple and others are anticompetitive.\\n\\n“This case is about the future of the internet and whether Google’s search engine will ever face meaningful competition,” Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department’s lead litigator, said during opening arguments last month. As far back as 2010, he argues, Google has maintained an illegal monopoly, with its role as the default engine across much of the internet being a key factor.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOne upshot of the trial could be that the tech giant is forced to stop paying companies to make Google the default on various devices. Critics, meanwhile, contend the government should force Google to make it easier for Android users to set the default to rival services.\\n\\nAnother revelation from the trial suggesting how important defaults are to Google was highlighted by The Verge. Jim Kolotouros, vice president\\xa0 of Android platform partnerships, wrote in an internal email in 2020: “Chrome exists to serve Google search. If it cannot do that because it is regulated to be set by the user, the value of users using Chrome goes to almost zero (for me).”\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-claims-doesn-t-monopoly-220514758.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.962, 'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.108}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T21:53:43+00:00', 'title': 'Apple, Fed Meeting, Caterpillar, Jobs Report: Investing Action Plan', 'content': 'As the market rolls out of October, Apple and Caterpillar, a Fed meeting and October payrolls set the tone for the coming week.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d065d500-8fc7-3dbb-acf4-38f1f1e42056/apple%2C-fed-meeting%2C.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'CAT.MX', 'CAT.US', 'CAT1.F', 'CAT1.XETRA', 'CATR.PA', 'GSPC.INDX'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T21:40:28+00:00', 'title': 'Fed decision, Apple earnings, jobs data: What to watch', 'content': \"The Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision will be announced on Wednesday.

(Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times)\\n\\nOrange County entrepreneur Joe Kiani has just notched a startling victory in his years-long court battle against one of the most powerful companies in the world. And as a result, one of Apple's key products may be banned from import into the United States.\\n\\nI recently detailed Kiani's David-vs.-Goliath legal fight against Apple, which Kiani claims has infringed on patents owned by his company, the Irvine-based medical device manufacturer Masimo.\\n\\nIt turns out the United States International Trade Commission agrees. It just sided with Kiani, issuing a ruling that the Apple Watch contains technology that violates Masimo's patents, and handing down an exclusion order that, if it stands, would result in the devices being banned from import into the United States unless the infringing technology is removed.\\n\\nThe ruling upholds an initial finding in January that determined Apple had infringed on Masimo’s pulse-oximetry technology, which allows users to take readings of blood-oxygen levels. Earlier this year, a separate federal trial over whether Apple had profited from trade secrets stolen from Masimo, to the tune of $1.85 billion, ended in a hung jury.\\n\\nThe ITC ruling will now undergo a 60-day presidential review period in which President Biden has the power to veto the ruling.

For founder Kiani, the fight was over more than protecting Masimo’s patented technology — it was about standing up to tech giants that use their power to shut out smaller competitors like him.\\n\\n“Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,” Kiani said in a statement. “This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nKiani has claimed in legal filings that Apple first approached Masimo more than a decade ago, floating the idea of a partnership, and potentially an acquisition. Instead, he says, the tech giant began a campaign to hire away his top talent and to plunder his company’s intellectual property. He estimates that he has spent $60 million in legal fees waging a fight that few others are willing to undertake against the tech giants.\\n\\nFor Kiani, the ITC’s ruling is a vindication.\\n\\n“Injunction is the best repellent to IP infringers and fundamental to patent rights,” Kiani told me.\\n\\nIn a statement, an Apple spokesperson said, “Masimo has wrongly attempted to use the ITC to keep a potentially lifesaving product from millions of U.S. consumers while making way for their own watch that copies Apple.

In today's presentation, Jonathan Reich, Zedge's Chief Executive Officer; and Yi Tsai, Zedge's Chief Financial Officer, will discuss Zedge's financial and operating results that we reported today. Any forward-looking statements made during this conference call during the prepared remarks or in the question-and-answer session, whether general or specific in nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in the future to differ materially from those discussed on today's call. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, specific risks and uncertainties disclosed in the reports that Zedge periodically filed with the SEC. Zedge [ph] assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to update the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that they forecast.\\n\\nPlease note that our earnings release is available on the Investor Relations page of the website. The earnings release has also been filed on Form 8-K with the SEC. I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan.\\n\\nJonathan Reich: Good afternoon. Thank you, Brian and thank you all for joining us today. I will start by briefly reviewing our fourth quarter results which were generally in line with our expectations. Q4 revenue decreased 10% from last year. While we encounter challenges stemming from the combination of geopolitical, economic and industry-specific issues, we observed ongoing stabilization in advertising with ad revenue remaining flat sequentially, even during the traditionally weaker Q4 period. Furthermore, in Q4 of fiscal year 2022, we had a onetime $4 million accounting benefit, skewing year-over-year earnings comparisons. Other positive highlights from the quarter included 7% sequential growth in subscription revenue as our new iOS and overhauled Android offerings contributed to positive momentum.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAdditionally, Zedge Premium's gross transaction value, or GTV, was up 14% year-over-year and down $26,000 sequentially, benefiting from paying users of pAInt, our generative AI wallpaper maker. All of this led to higher gross margin and sequential growth [ph]. Finally, Emojipedia continued to build on its momentum throughout the year with revenue up nearly 70% versus last year. Every year, we pick at least one company-wide area of focus to overhaul. In fiscal year '23, we address data and analytics and I'm happy to report that we achieved our goal of democratizing data. The improvements we made in our product, marketing, monetization, finance and executive teams to access accurate and granular data more quickly and run experiments in concert with one another to more easily and quickly make data-driven decisions.\\n\\nAs a part of this overhaul, we expanded our data team and we are now very well positioned for continued evolution in a world that is ever dependent on data supremacy. In fiscal 2024, we are committed to building a full stack marketing team with capabilities spanning user acquisition, branding, creative creation, marketing analytics and reporting, competitive research, content marketing, App Store and search engine optimization and reengagement marketing. Though we already possess many of these skills, we're now bulking up in the areas we haven't previously invested in. Furthermore, we are also using AI in our workflow to scale quickly and efficiently. In light of the sea [ph] change that has occurred in the mobile app marketing space with Apple's IDFA deprecation and the upcoming rollout of Google's privacy sandbox across Android and has become imperative for app developers like us to excel in many marketing disciplines.\\n\\nWe expect to increase our investment in paid user acquisition and enhance our expertise in all areas of the marketing staff to generate attractive return on ad spend or ROAS efficiently. From a product perspective, we have multiple initiatives to enhance existing products and further diversify our portfolio. From the Zedge marketplace, we will focus on expanding pAInt, our generative AI wallpaper maker. Our key priorities include the global rollout of paint which may unleash high-growth opportunities, especially in markets where we are an early entrant [ph]. We also plan to offer pAInt on our website, enabling users to create all types of images not only wallpapers. I want to underscore that our current iteration of paint opens new opportunities in the iOS ecosystem where we can compete on equal footing in light of Apple openly welcoming this new technology.\\n\\nFinally, in the second half of this year, we expect to introduce a stand-alone Gen AI app that will offer many more capabilities and with time encompass more than images alone. Beyond iOS and Android, we plan to revamp our website, enabling users to access pAInt to create all types of images, not only wallpapers. We will also test a print-on-demand capability so that users can bring their creations into the real world. I mentioned Zedge Plus, our Zedge marketplace subscription offering earlier. I'm excited because prospective subscribers are responding well to the overhaul evidenced by our subscription revenue going up on a sequential basis. With ongoing investments, not only in marketing but also testing subscription value adds and a variety of pricing SKUs, we hope to return to subscriber growth sooner rather than later.\\n\\nTurning to GuruShots; not unlike what we initially experienced with the Emojipedia, GuruShots is taking more time to scale than we would prefer, yet we remain confident in its long-term prospects. Although the gaming sector has faced global and economic challenges, the thorniest issue relates to Apple's app transparency tracking framework which severely limits the information that app marketers can secure to target prospective customers. Although Apple released Scab Network 4.0 in order to enable growth with improved attribution tracking capabilities, the impact will be limited until major platforms like Meta, are successful in embedding this into their tech stack. In the meantime, we are taking a two-pronged approach to stabilizing GuruShots resorts and positioning it for growth. abstract, access, background, cell, chart, cloud, computer, computing, concept, data, desktop, electronic, email, file, firewall, graph, illustration, information, infrastructure, internet, laptop, mobile, mobility, modem, network, networking, pc, phone, protection, security, server, smart, system, tablet, technology, wifi, workstation\\n\\nCopyright: hywards / 123RF Stock Photo\\n\\nFirst, we focused on product innovation by rolling out Battles, a new hybrid casual gameplay future for users to start competing in fast-paced short-duration photo competition that are limited in size. Battles is important and will help make the GuruShots game more accessible and relevant to a broader audience, hopefully, converting users into long-term players. In addition, we are also evolving with a token-based economy and we'll start introducing advertising supported experiences in early calendar 2024. Second, we are working closely with both Google and Meta to adapt and expand ROAS-positive paid user acquisition by optimizing against several inputs, including creatives. This will take time and resources as their algorithms optimize for relevant customers.\\n\\nSuffice it to say, we are monitoring developments closely, testing, speaking with other publishers and keeping our ear close to the ground to invest wisely. We are building on Emojipedia's fiscal 2023 success with continued inhibition and plan to test features like emoji translations and mashups along with new content verticals like emoticons, print-on-demand merchandising and hypercasual emoji games and quizzes. Beyond our 3 core product groups, we have soft launched AI Art Master in 5 countries and currently plan to expand globally over the next several months. We believe AI Art Master a hybrid casual Gen AI game that enables users to create wowing content to compete against other players in fun fast-paced competitions has the potential to be a fourth core product for us.\\n\\nAI Art Master capitalizes on GuruShots mobile gaming expertise and the hottest tech trend, Gen AI, positioning AI Art Master at the center of the explosive growth that both the Gen AI and gaming sectors are experiencing. Taken together, we believe that we have never been in a better position to create sustainable, long-term profitable growth given the combination of market opportunity, our current product portfolio and road map our marketing prowess, data capabilities, tech stack and most importantly, our team. Furthermore, we are not just talking about AI. We have already integrated it throughout our business including products, technology and marketing. Additionally, we have a relatively untapped opportunity in the mobile gaming sector with GuruShots and AI Art Master that are based on our acquisition of GuruShots in 2022.\\n\\nBefore closing, I want to underscore that Zedge is fortunate to have GuruShots as a member of our family. As you know, GuruShots is headquartered in Tel Aviv [ph] and Zedge stands firmly with Israel. We are appalled by Hamas barbarick behavior and our hearts go out to the victims of Hamas' heinous attack and the victims' families and friends. I want to thank our employees and remain humbled by your courage and commitment, especially in the face of terrorism, rocket fire, Army mobilizations, school closings and the like. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Yi, who will review our financial results. Yi?\\n\\nYi Tsai: Thank you, Jonathan. Starting with our fourth quarter results. Now for the Zedge marketplace defined as the number of unique users that opened the Zedge app during the last 30 days of the period. Decreased 3.4% from a year ago to $30.9 million. Now in well-developed markets and emerging markets were down 6.8% and 2.4%, respectively. Europe which contributes to both metrics continues to suffer on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and inflation. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.6 million, down 10% from last year. Digital goods and services which encompasses revenue from GuruShots came in at $1 million, down 29% from last year. Similar to Q3, GuruShots revenue was negatively impacted by Apple's ATT framework, macroeconomic issues and the geopolitical situation.\\n\\nSubscription revenue for the quarter was down 3% versus last year. However, this metric was up sequentially as our active subscriber trend improved and higher-value IOS attrition and our new value-added Zedge Plus offering for Android, replaced lower cost legacy subscription which only removed ads. Net premium GDV grew 14.3% from last year to $384,000, reflecting incremental revenue generally from pAInt which offset a modest decline in other content sales. Average revenue per monthly active user of [indiscernible] and decrease of 5.5% year-over-year. Still, this metric was up 4% sequentially, reflecting stability in ad pricing and a positive impact of our new IOS and Android subscription. After backing out the onetime $4 million accounting benefit in Q4 of last year, operating expenses were flat year-over-year at $5.1 million.\\n\\nGAAP net income for Q4 was $0.2 million and EPS was $0.01. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 million versus $2.2 million in the prior year period. From a liquidity standpoint, we remain in a strong cash position with over $80 million in cash and cash equivalents and only $2 million in bank loans.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\\n\\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\\n\\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nWhat Is Apple's Debt?\\n\\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$109.3b of debt in July 2023, down from US$119.7b, one year before. However, it does have US$62.5b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$46.8b. debt-equity-history-analysis\\n\\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\\n\\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Apple had liabilities of US$125.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$149.8b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$62.5b and US$39.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$173.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\\n\\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$2.61t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\\n\\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple's net debt is only 0.38 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 470 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. But the other side of the story is that Apple saw its EBIT decline by 5.2% over the last year. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\\n\\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 92% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\\n\\nOur View\\n\\nThe good news is that Apple's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for Apple that you should be aware of.\\n\\nIf you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this freelist of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.\\n\\nHave feedback on this article?

Thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start by briefly reviewing our fourth quarter results, which were generally in line with our expectations. Q4 revenue decreased 10% from last year. While we encountered challenges stemming from the combination of geopolitical, economic, and industry specific issues, we observed ongoing stabilization in advertising with ad revenue remaining flat sequentially even during the traditionally weaker Q4 period.\\r\\nFurthermore, in Q4 of fiscal year 2022, we had a one-time $4 million accounting benefit skewing year-over-year earnings comparisons. Other positive highlights from the quarter included 7% sequential growth in subscription revenue and our new iOS and overhauled Android offerings contributed to positive momentum.\\r\\nAdditionally, Zedge Premium's gross transaction value, or GTV, was up 14% year over year and down $26,000 sequentially, benefiting from paying users of pAInt, our generative AI wallpaper maker. All of this led to higher gross margin and sequential ARPMAU growth.\\r\\nFinally, Emojipedia continued to build on its momentum throughout the year with revenue up nearly 70% versus last year. Every year, we pick at least one company-wide area of focus to overhaul. In fiscal year '23, we addressed data and analytics, and I'm happy to report that we achieved our goal of democratizing data.\\r\\nThe improvements we made empower our product, marketing, monetization, finance, and executive teams to access accurate and granular data more quickly and run experiments in concert with one another to more easily and quickly make data-driven decisions. As a part of this overhaul, we expanded our data team, and we are now very well positioned for continued evolution in a world that is ever dependent on data supremacy.\\r\\nIn fiscal 2024, we are committed to building a full-stack marketing team with capabilities spanning user acquisition, branding, creative creation, marketing analytics and reporting, competitive research, content marketing, app store, and search engine optimization, and reengagement marketing. Though we already possess many of these skills, we're now bulking up in the areas we haven't previously invested in.\\r\\nFurthermore, we are also using AI in our workflow to scale quickly and efficiently. In light of the sea change that has occurred in the mobile app marketing space with Apple's IDFA deprecation and the upcoming rollout of Google's Privacy Sandbox across Android, it has become imperative for app developers like us to excel in many marketing disciplines. We expect to increase our investment in paid user acquisition and enhance our expertise in all areas of the marketing stack to generate attractive return on ad spend or roll-offs efficiently.\\r\\nFrom a product perspective, we have multiple initiatives to enhance existing products and further diversify our portfolio. From the Zedge Marketplace, we will focus on expanding pAInt, our generative AI wallpaper maker. Our key priorities include the global rollout of pAInt, which may unleash high-growth opportunities, especially in markets where we are an early entrant. We also plan to offer pAInt on our website, enabling users to create all types of images, not only wallpapers.\\r\\nI want to underscore that our current iteration of pAInt open new opportunities in the iOS ecosystem where we can compete on equal footing in light of Apple openly welcoming this new technology.\\r\\nFinally, in the second half of this year, we expect to introduce a standalone Gen AI app that will offer many more capabilities and with time, encompass more than images alone. Beyond iOS and Android, we plan to revamp our website, enabling users to access pAInt to create all types of images, not only wallpapers. We will also test a print-on-demand capability so that users can bring their creations into the real world.\\r\\nI mentioned Zedge+, our Zedge marketplace subscription offering, earlier. I'm excited because prospective subscribers are responding well to the overhaul evidenced by our subscription revenue going up on a sequential basis. With ongoing investments not only in marketing but also in testing subscription value ads and a variety of pricing SKUs, we hope to return to subscriber growth sooner rather than later.\\r\\nTurning to GuruShots, not unlike what we initially experienced with Emojipedia, GuruShots is taking more time to scale than we would prefer. Yet, we remain confident in its long-term prospects. Although the gaming sector has faced global and economic challenges, the thorniest issue relates to Apple's App Transparency Tracking framework, which severely limits the information that ad marketers can secure to target prospective customers.\\r\\nAlthough Apple released SKAdNetwork 4.0 in order to enable growth with improved attribution tracking capabilities, the impact will be limited until major platforms like Meta are successful in embedding this into their tech stack. In the meantime, we are taking a two-pronged approach to stabilizing GuruShots and positioning it for growth.\\r\\nFirst, we focused on product innovation by rolling out Battles, a new hybrid casual gameplay feature for users to start competing in fast paced short duration photo competitions that are limited in size. Battles is important and will help make the GuruShots game more accessible and relevant to a broader audience, hopefully converting users into long-term players. In addition, we are also evolving with a token-based economy, and we'll start introducing advertising supported experiences in early calendar 2024.\\r\\nSecond, we are working closely with both Google and Meta to adapt and expand ROAS-positive paid user acquisition by optimizing against several inputs, including creatives. This will take time and resources as their algorithms optimize for relevant customers.\\r\\nSuffice it to say, we are monitoring developments closely, testing, speaking with other publishers, and keeping our ear close to the ground to invest wisely. We are building out Emojipedia's fiscal 2023 success with continued innovation and plan to test features like emoji translations and mash ups along with new content verticals like emoticons, print-on-demand merchandising, and hyper-casual emoji games and quizzes.\\r\\nBeyond our three core product groups, we have soft-launched the AI Art Master in five countries and currently plan to expand globally over the next several months. We believe AI Art Master, a hybrid casual Gen AI game that enables users to create wowing content to compete against other players in fun, fast-paced competitions, has the potential to be a fourth core product for us.\\r\\nAI Art Master capitalizes on GuruShots' mobile gaming expertise and the hottest tech trend, Gen AI, positioning AI Art Master at the center of the explosive growth that both the Gen AI and gaming sectors are experiencing. Taken together, we believe that we have never been in a better position to create sustainable, long-term, profitable growth, given the combination of market opportunity, our current product portfolio and roadmap, our marketing prowess, data capabilities, tech stack, and most importantly, our team.\\r\\nFurthermore, we are not just talking about AI, we have already integrated it throughout our business, including products, technology, and marketing. Additionally, we have a relatively untapped opportunity in the mobile gaming sector with GuruShots and AI Art Master that are based on our acquisition of GuruShots in 2022.\\r\\nBefore closing, I want to underscore that Zedge is fortunate to have GuruShots as a member of our family. As you know, GuruShots is headquartered in Tel Aviv and Zedge stands firmly with Israel. We were appalled by Hamas' barbaric behavior and our hearts go out to the victims of Hamas' heinous attack and the victim's families and friends.\\r\\nI want to thank our employees and remain humbled by your courage and commitment, especially in the face of terrorism, rocket fire, army mobilizations, school closings, and the like.\\r\\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Yi, who will review our financial results. Yi?\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nYi Tsai\\n\\nThank you, Jonathan. Starting with our fourth quarter result, now, for the Zedge marketplace, defined as the number of unique users that opened the Zedge app during the last 30 days of the period. Decreased 3.4% from year ago to $30.9 million. MAU in well-developed markets and emerging market was down 6.8% and 2.4%, respectively.\\r\\nEurope, which contribute to both metrics, continued to suffer from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and inflation. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.6 million, down 10% from last year. Digital goods and services, which encompasses revenue from GuruShots, came in at $1 million, down 29% from last year.\\r\\nSimilar to Q3, GuruShots revenue was negatively impacted by Apple's ATT framework, macroeconomic issues, and the geopolitical situation. Subscription revenue for the quarter was down 3% versus last year. However, this metric was up sequentially as our active subscriber trend improved and higher-value iOS subscription and our new value-added Zedge+ offering for Android replaced lower costs legacy subscription, which only removed ads.\\r\\nZedge Premium GTV grew 14.3% from last year to $384,000, reflecting incremental revenue generated from pAInt, which offset modest decline in other content sales. Average revenue per monthly active user, our ARPMAU, was $0.055, a decrease of 5.5% year over year. Still, this metric was up 4% sequentially, reflecting stability in ad pricing and a positive impact of our new iOS and Android subscription.\\r\\nAfter backing out a one-time $4 million accounting benefit in Q4 of last year, operating expenses were flat year-over-year at $5.1 million. GAAP net income for Q4 was $0.2 million and EPS was $0.01. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 million versus $2.2 million in the prior year period.\\r\\nFrom a liquidity standpoint, we remain in a strong cash position with over $18 million in cash and cash equivalents, and only $2 million in bank loans. We repurchased 72,000 Class B shares during the quarter at a weighted average price of $1.98 per share. In total, we bought back roughly 759,000 of our Class B common stock during fiscal 2023.\\r\\nThank you for listening to our fourth quarter earnings call and I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in mid-December.\\r\\nOperator, back to you for Q&A.\\n\\nQuestion and Answer Session\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Allen Klee, Maxim Group.\\n\\nAllen Klee\\n\\nYeah, hi. Good quarter. Our thoughts are with your own employees at GuruShots. I wanted to start with Apple's privacy rules now and the actions that big sites like Facebook are using. How do you think about how this is going to play out in terms of the potential timing of the effectiveness of the advertising to improve over time?\\n\\nJonathan Reich\\n\\nHi, Allen. Thank you. Thank you for your thoughts. We appreciate that. In terms of timing, that's, I think, not $64,000 question, but the $64 million question. As far as we're concerned, until platforms like Meta or Facebook have fully implemented a working version of [SCAN-4], it is going to be complicated to scale effective advertising without having any data there to drive better marketing decisions.\\r\\nI think that you know that Meta had rolled out a version of SCAN almost at around month-and-a-half, two months ago, and then quickly had to reverse that introduction. Seeing between the lines, it was likely not yet ready for prime time. And I can only imagine that this is amongst one of the highest priorities for their business.\\r\\nHaving said that, and as I described during the call, we are using other mechanisms in order to optimize. Whether it be rapidly and materially increasing the number of creatives that we have, using all sorts of different creative styles. So as an example, you can see videos or promotional videos and things of that sort coupled with spending based upon where we are seeing an appropriate return on ad spend.\\r\\nI can assure you that as soon as Facebook is, or Meta is ready to implement this at scale of it, we will jump on that bandwagon and begin to capitalize on the introduction of SCAN-4. I also -- I think it's important to mention that we have become, what I will call, managed account customers of both Meta and Google. Meaning that there are dedicated account managers with subject matter expertise that are overseeing our accounts working closely with our team in terms of helping us expand the marketing initiatives that we have in a ROI or ROAS-positive fashion.\\r\\nAnd I would just underscore, in light of the downsizing that Meta has undertaken this year, I view that as -- due to the fact that we are, qoute-unqoute, have this managed account status, that is indicative of how interested they are in our business and how we can scale with them. I hope that answers your question.\\n\\nAllen Klee\\n\\nYeah. That was great. Thank you. You mentioned a lot of initiatives for fiscal '24, what would say are kind of the top ones that you think would potentially have an impact on '24 and '25's financials?\\n\\nJonathan Reich\\n\\nSure. So let's take a look at each of the business units. The flagship Zedge ringtones and wallpaper business unit, we are really investing a tremendous amount of effort in terms of improving our subscription offering. And as you know, the financials associated with subscriptions are very attractive, not only is the profit margin attractive but we also receive the cash upfront.\\r\\nJust the notion of having rolled out an iOS subscription is something which is having a meaningful impact, and I would note that in the US the price point for an iOS subscription is around $20 per customer, that is, the resale value, if you will, compared to Android, which is around $5 for an annual subscription. So very, very significant increase.\\r\\nBut it's more than simply price testing and coming up with the price that resonates with users, it's also the value adds and there's a whole bunch of work being done there in addition to marketing efforts. Then, in respect to the flagship as well, we are continuing to invest in pAInt, which is our Gen AI wallpaper maker. Rolling that out on a global basis.\\r\\nAnd we may see some accelerated growth there in markets where we are early. Many of the Gen AI apps today that are in this space use a subscription business model, which doesn't necessarily align well with many of the markets that are outside of United States, Canada, and UK, Australia, as an example. And so when you get into more emerging market community, that is, the notion of subscription is less palatable. So there's a lot of work going on in terms of making this available and continuing to improve the experience. So we may have a -- some early mover advantage, if we're successful there.\\r\\nAnd then I'd mentioned that we're also working on a standalone AI app and the notion there is to have an app which is not only wallpaper-driven, but image driven and other potential forms of content that has a much more intuitive user interface and which allows for us to really market the notion of Gen AI as opposed to that being a feature within our app. And then also, this introduction of pAInt to our website, that should be available in the next couple of weeks. So a lot of effort going into that.\\r\\nMoving to GuruShots, the -- I'd say, two drivers are in the GuruShots game itself, the introduction of Battles and using Battles as a mechanism to improve engagement as well as attract and open up the top of the funnel to bring in customers that would want to get a sense for what our competitions are, but with a much lower, much easier barrier in terms of learning curve. And that is what is happening there with the sort of hybrid casual experience. And we continue to believe that that will unlock growth for us.\\r\\nAnd then the brand-new AI Art Master game, which is 100% hybrid casual and taps into the growth of not only Gen AI, but also growth in the gaming space. So looking out over the course of the next two fiscal years, we are really trying to deliver that promise to the marketplace, and apart from the market, I should say, to investors.\\r\\nAnd then finally, in Emojipedia, so we've seen some substantial revenue growth year over year and our ability to continue to add functionality, broaden the focus of Emojipedia to new content types, and introduce enhancers, for example, [POD]. We think that that can continue to drive incremental growth to that business unit.\\n\\nAllen Klee\\n\\nThank you. In terms of -- last quarter, you mentioned that you were initiating a $2.5 million to $3 million cost cutting initiative, or that's what the benefit you would get annually, I think? If any of -- has that happened already or any update on that?\\n\\nJonathan Reich\\n\\nSo we had announced this -- it was not last quarter. I think it was two to three quarters ago. And yeah, we had acted on that, including a host of different initiatives from SaaS infrastructure to staffing. As you know, we've got employees in different regions of the world, different price points and the like to our marketing investment and so on and so forth.\\r\\nAnd we have acted on that and we will continue to -- keep in mind, we want to be in a position where ultimately our cash position continues to grow and that we're not getting too far ahead of ourselves in terms of expanding the initiatives or having SG&A grow at a unsustainable pace.\\r\\nI just want to underscore, I think it's very important when taking a look at SG&A to remember that within SG&A, we have both our marketing expense as well as the percentage that whether it be Google or Apple keeps when a user spends money on their platform. So SG&A is expected to grow, but that tied to marketing and that growth is something that we can expand or contract based upon ROAS.\\r\\nThe other thing that I think it's important to talk about when considering marketing in our growth plan is the fact that marketing is a much different animal than it was three, four years ago because of all the privacy stuff, whether it be ATT with Apple or soon to be Google's Privacy Sandbox. And that will mean that it will take more time to get recurring results that one can then say with confidence, hey, we can expand or this is not the right thing to optimize yet.\\r\\nHowever, as I had also mentioned in my recorded remarks, we have prioritized for the entire company, the notion of really building out this full stack marketing team. And seeing to it that we address not only paid user acquisition expertise, but also things like app store optimization, search engine optimization, branding, product marketing, just to name a couple of those components. So that is what we believe to be critical for the ongoing growing success of our business.\\n\\nAllen Klee\\n\\nThank you. For fiscal '24, I think historically, the first quarter is a seasonally slower quarter. Would you agree that that's most likely? Maybe talk about that, just the seasonality, how that typically plays out in the quarters and, is there anything you wanted to comment on of financial outlook for or goals of -- just any type of financial goals for fiscal '24? Thank you.\\n\\nJonathan Reich\\n\\nSure. So we've historically not provided projections. I will say that seasonality because we have a very, very large percentage of revenue coming from advertising is tied to ad spend typically in the holiday season.\\r\\nSo our fiscal Q2, which is November, December, January is typically the strongest quarter of the year. And then when you get into calendar, let's say calendar Q2 -- or Q1, I should say, you begin to see a downturn.\\r\\nSo although we're technically a month off, generally speaking, seasonality for ad spend aligns with what happens in a typical ad-driven business and that generally holds up. It's not 100% the case, but that generally is an indication of how our business is impacted.\\r\\nWe are fortunate because we do have other diversification, or we have diversification with the subscriptions in there and so on and so forth. And that subscription revenue, as you know, is amortized over the life of that subscription.\\r\\nSo going back to my earlier comment, our ability to continue to have success with our overhauled subscription offering for Android or the newly introduced iOS subscription offering is something which is really a key part to our ability to diversify revenue and have some insulation there, if you will.\\n\\nAllen Klee\\n\\nThank you. One of the other things you mentioned was as an initiative for fiscal '24 is building out your marketing capabilities. Could you maybe just expand a little more on that on what you meant by that?\\n\\nJonathan Reich\\n\\nSure. Prior to the acquisition of GuruShots, Zedge's growth was primarily driven by organic installs where you know that we surpassed in aggregate over 600 million installs of our app on a global basis and the acquisition of GuruShots introduced a new facet to marketing, where in the deep mobile gaming space, paid user acquisition is a key growth driver.\\r\\nAnd in parallel with that, we had also started to dip our toe in the market with respect to paid user acquisition in our flagship Zedge marketplace. And we have expanded that investment over time with what we believe to be attractive return on ad spend investment, a much different profile between the Zedge marketplace around Zedge App for paid user acquisition versus GuruShots. But in order to be successful in our investment in marketing, we have many different areas that we are refining and we are investing.\\r\\nAnd so, as I mentioned earlier, not only building out a stellar user acquisition team that's focused on both paid and organic channels, but touching upon the fiscal 2023 goal of overhauling data and analytics, we need very, very precise reporting so that we can make good advertising decisions or user acquisition decisions, investing in things like app store optimization, search engine optimization, messaging and reengagement marketing, content marketing, and then also taking advantage of various forms of tech that can provide us with some additional information or can help us in terms of content creation and things of that sort, all become critical to this investment that we're making.\\r\\nSo that is I think the next -- one of the areas that when looking back in a year and two years from now, we're going to see just having a much more robust team.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of recent market trends in the smartphone industry, then go and check out the 5 Easiest Smartphones To Use For Seniors and The Elderly.\\n\\nSmartphones have unquestionably transformed our way of life and how we engage with the world. They have introduced numerous advantages that enhance our daily routines, rendering them more convenient and streamlined. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that they also carry inherent drawbacks and potential perils. Psychotherapist Thomas Kersting, during his appearance on \\'FOX & Friends,\\' sheds light on the impact of hundreds of phone alerts that distract teenagers daily, coining the term \"Weapons of mass distraction\" to describe smartphones.\\n\\nFurthermore, the impact of mobile devices in educational settings is a matter of concern as highlighted by UNESCO, the United Nations\\' Agency for Education, Science, and Culture. Their report underscores the potential for distraction, privacy risks, and cyberbullying that mobile devices can introduce into classrooms.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the report reveals that fewer than one in four countries have enacted laws or policies prohibiting the use of phones in schools. While in the UK, headteachers have the authority to set rules regarding smartphone usage, most schools have implemented restrictions. Manos Antoninis, the author of the 2023 Global Education Monitor report, emphasized their findings and underscored the growing concern about the responsible use of technology in educational settings. He says,\\n\\n\"We have identified instances of smartphone usage in schools that not only distract students from learning but also pose a threat to their privacy. In educational environments, only technology that enhances learning should have a place.\"\\n\\nThe Dutch government has recently unveiled plans to ban the use of devices, including mobile phones, in classrooms to prevent disruptions to the learning environment. This initiative is being introduced in collaboration with educational institutions and is slated to come into effect at the beginning of the next academic year. Certain exceptions will be made, such as allowing students with medical needs or disabilities to use their devices and permitting classes specifically focused on digital skills. While the ban is not currently legally enforceable, it may be in the future. Education Minister Robbert Dijkgraaf stated,\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"Despite the pervasive presence of mobile phones in our lives, they have no place in the classroom. Students must have the ability to concentrate and be afforded every opportunity to learn effectively. Scientific research has shown that mobile phones disrupt this process.\"\\n\\nSmartphones Among Seniors\\n\\nWhile smartphones may not be suitable in the classroom, they undoubtedly serve as essential lifelines for seniors, enabling them to stay connected with friends and family members. The use of smartphones among the elderly has witnessed a significant upsurge in recent years. Seniors increasingly rely on smartphones for various purposes, including maintaining social connections, engaging with social media, enjoying games, and even shopping online.\\n\\nAccording to recent statistics, the ownership of smartphones among adults aged 65 and above has surged by 24%, soaring from 18% to 42% since 2013, with a remarkable 87.21% of seniors now owning and using smartphones, according to findings by Pew Research.\\n\\nThe majority of seniors put their mobile devices to good use, primarily for staying in touch through phone calls, text messaging, web browsing, and seeking directions when needed.\\n\\nSo what’s the easiest smartphone to use for seniors? We will uncover this question soon, let’s first discuss some of the leading players in the smartphone industry.\\n\\nAlthough Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung currently hold a dominant position in the smartphone market, it\\'s important to note that their smartphones may not be accessible to everyone due to their pricing. As a result, some companies that are gaining popularity among consumers are Lenovo Group Limited (OTC:LNVGY), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Xiaomi Corporation (OTC:XIACY), thanks to their budget-friendly phone offerings.\\n\\nLenovo Group Limited (OTC:LNVGY) is a Chinese multinational technology firm renowned for its innovative products catering to diverse customer needs. Lenovo Group Limited (OTC:LNVGY) smartphone manufacturer has been consistently enhancing its profitability in the smartphone sector, primarily through effective transformation initiatives and an efficient expense optimization program.\\n\\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is a diversified Japanese multinational conglomerate with a presence in multiple sectors, including electronics, gaming, entertainment, and financial services. In addition to its extensive portfolio, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is a prominent player in the smartphone industry. Recently, the company introduced its latest flagship smartphone, the Xperia 1 V, featuring an innovative stacked CMOS image sensor with a 2-layer Transistor Pixel technology.\\n\\nXiaomi Corporation (OTC:XIACY) is a Chinese multinational electronics firm specializing in the design, development, and sale of smartphones, hardware, and software products. Renowned for its ability to incorporate state-of-the-art technologies into its devices while maintaining affordability, Xiaomi Corporation (OTC:XIACY) recently unveiled the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G on September 1. This latest addition to their lineup boasts 5G connectivity and features an intricate design with a sleek metallic finish.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s delve into a few smartphones that are designed with seniors in mind and are available in the market. 15 Easiest Smartphones to Use for Seniors and the Elderly\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo compile a list of the 15 easiest smartphones for seniors and the elderly, we followed a systematic approach. We began by gathering information from credible sources like SeniorLiving.org and Age Space, among others. Our focus was to identify smartphones that catered to the needs of older users. These criteria included larger screen sizes, font enlargement options, a simplified one-click easy mode, clear loudspeakers, straightforward navigation systems, ample storage capacity, the presence of an SOS button, and even wireless charging for convenience.\\n\\nAfter assembling a pool of smartphones that met these criteria, we meticulously evaluated each device. Each phone received a scale of 1 to 10 rating, with 1 denoting an average user-friendliness rating and 10 signifying the most accessible option for elderly individuals. Finally, we organized the list in ascending order based on these ratings.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested, also check out 10 Best Rugged Smartphones in 2023.\\n\\n15 Easiest Smartphones For Seniors\\n\\nHere is the list of the easiest smartphones for seniors and the elderly.\\n\\n15.

That’s an unusual hour for an Apple launch and the timing on Halloween eve is likely meant to fit the spooky theme, dubbed “Scary Fast.” In another twist, the company isn’t holding an in-person gathering at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, making it an online-only affair.\\n\\nApple hasn’t said what it will reveal at the event — beyond showing a Mac software icon in the invite — but Bloomberg has reported that the company is preparing fresh MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktops. The machines probably won’t have a radical new look, but will likely include Apple’s first M3 3-nanometer processors. Those chips are expected to be a significant improvement over the M2 line, which was first rolled out in June 2022.\\n\\nThe new models come at a critical moment for Apple. The personal computing market is finally pulling out of a post-pandemic slump, and new competitors are looking to push into the industry. That includes Nvidia Corp., which is developing its own PC processors, Bloomberg reported this week. Qualcomm Inc., best known for smartphone chips, also is making a play for the PC market.\\n\\nRead More: Qualcomm Says New PC Chip Can Outperform Apple, Intel\\n\\nApple is looking to new products to help drive a resurgence during its all-important holiday period. It’s coming off several quarters of declining sales. The company will reveal its latest financial results three days after the event, on Nov. 2.\\n\\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple has already unveiled several new Macs this year. In January, it rolled out MacBook Pros with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, in addition to a Mac mini. In June, Apple released its first 15-inch MacBook Air and faster Mac Studio models, as well as its first Mac Pro that uses the company’s home-grown chips — known as Apple Silicon.\\n\\nWhile the Mac is no longer at the center of Apple’s business, it’s still a key moneymaker. The division represents about 10% of annual sales, making it bigger than the iPad and around the same size as Apple’s wearables lineup. Wall Street estimates that the Mac will bring in just under $8.1 billion in the holiday quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be up from last year, but down considerably from the same period two years ago — when the home office boom was still fueling sales.\\n\\nHere is everything that can be expected on Monday:\\n\\nMacBook Pro:\\n\\nHigh-end MacBook Pros codenamed J514 and J516. The machines will look nearly identical to current models, but will probably include speedier new M3 Pro and M3 Max processors. The company has been testing multiple different versions of the M3 Pro processor. One baseline version in the works has 12 main processor cores, made up of six high-performance blocks and six high-efficiency cores. Generally speaking, the more cores you have, the more powerful the chip. The product also has 18 cores for processing graphics. That would be an increase of two main processing cores — known as CPU cores — and two graphics cores over the current model. Another M3 Pro chip seen in testing by developers has 14 main processing cores, including 10 for high performance and four for efficiency, and 30 graphics cores. There are multiple versions of the M3 Max in testing, including a top-end version with 16 main processing cores — 12 for high performance and four for efficiency — and 40 graphics cores. Apple has also tested updated configurations for memory, or RAM, including new 24-gigabyte and 48-gigabyte options. While it’s unclear which chip configurations will ultimately ship, the components are likely to include improved gaming capabilities — similar to the iPhone 15 Pro’s A17 chip.\\n\\niMac:\\n\\nAn updated iMac for the first time in more than 900 days — an unusually long stretch. But don’t expect a bold new design. Like the MacBook Pros, the iMacs will look nearly identical to the existing versions. The current iMac design was announced in April 2021 when the company shifted to the M1 chip. The new 24-inch iMac — codenamed J433 and J434 — includes internal design changes and a revamped stand. The company has tested the machine in similar colors as the current models, but Apple could still change up the options at the unveiling. Apple developed this new iMac with the M3 chip. In testing, the company has used versions with the same number of main processing cores as the M2: four for high performance and four for efficiency. But it has tried new graphics configurations, including a chip with 10 graphics cores. As part of a broader shift to USB-C connectors, the company will likely roll out updated versions of accessories — including its trackpad, mouse and keyboard — that ditch the old Lightning ports. This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the iMac, which was one of the first products Steve Jobs introduced after returning to Apple in the late 1990s. The very first Mac, then called the Macintosh, debuted in early 1984.\\n\\nComing Later:\\n\\nWhile the company has been working on a low-end MacBook Pro codenamed J504 with a base version of the M3 chip, that machine likely won’t appear Monday. New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs with M3 chips — codenamed J613 and J615 — are also in development, but those aren’t scheduled for release until the first half of 2024. Though Apple typically introduces updated iPads around the same time as Macs, the company isn’t planning to debut new tablets until the spring. It’s working on an iPad Pro with an M3 chip, in addition to refreshed versions of the iPad Air, iPad mini and entry-level iPad. The company also announced a cheaper Apple Pencil earlier this month. AirPods won’t be updated again until next year. The company is working on new low-end models and AirPods Max headphones for late 2024. The AirPods Pro will get updated in 2025.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto’s Epic Fall X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter’s Business Venezuela’s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat China Premier Li Keqiang: ‘Economic Openness Serves Everyone Better’ The War That Broke Social Media\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-apple-plans-launch-oct-110021615.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'QCI.F', 'QCI.XETRA', 'QCOM.MX', 'QCOM.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.991, 'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.918, 'pos': 0.058}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T11:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Some Sunshine, and a Sunset, for the Bulls', 'content': \"I see a bounce is imminent, but will it repair the damaged charts?

According to data compiled by LPL Financial, a Santa Claus rally has occurred 79% of the time since 1950. Many investors look forward to a year-end rally that boosts their portfolios, and professional traders often rely on it to help determine their year-end bonus at work.

Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\\n\\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTech giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is banking on a big year-end sales push and its stock could benefit greatly should investor sentiment improve and there’s a strong year-end Santa Claus rally in the market. The company recently introduced a series of new consumer electronics with the goal of capitalizing on holiday consumer spending. Chief among these items is the newly released Quest 3 virtual reality headset, which costs $499 to purchase, and is focused on video games.\\n\\nThe new Quest 3 headset supports games from Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox video game unit and is positioned to attract gamers. Meta’s new VR headset has been released months ahead of the launch of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro augmented reality headset that is scheduled to be available to consumers in early 2024. Meta has also introduced a new version of its Ray-Ban mixed reality smart glasses that can capture photographs and videos with a voice command and is expected to sell briskly.\\n\\nMETA stock is already up 147% this year amid a big rally in mega-cap tech stocks. Further gains could come with a Santa Claus rally.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\\n\\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\\n\\nIf there’s another tech company that benefits from year-end holiday shopping and whose share price could get a lift from a Santa Claus rally, it is Apple. Each September, the company unveils its latest consumer electronics products ahead of the holiday shopping boom, where it sees increased sales for items ranging from its iPhone to its MacBook computer. This September, Apple introduced new smart watches, iPads, AirPods and, of course, the iPhone 15 that has a new charging port and stronger Titanium case, among other features.\\n\\nApple’s year-end sales boost is likely to extend into early 2024 as the company makes its highly anticipated Vision Pro mixed reality headset available to consumers. Introduced in June of this year, the Vision Pro headset is the first wholly new product from Apple in a decade, and it is expected to be a bestseller. AAPL stock could use any boost it gets from a Santa Claus rally. Due to ongoing issues in China, the company’s share price has slumped 3% over the past month, though it remains up 37% on the year.\\n\\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\\n\\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nCostcoWholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and its stock always do well during the holidays. The company’s grocery sales get a boost from holiday shopping, as do its online sales of electronics and other items. Like the other retailers on this list, Costco offers deals and discounts during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Boxing Day that attract consumer dollars. At the same time, COST stock also tends to get a boost whenever investor sentiment towards the retail sector improves, as it often does during a Santa Claus rally.\\n\\nThis year, the holidays arrive as Costco undergoes a leadership change for the first time in decades. The company just announced that Craig Jelinek, the long-time CEO of Costco, is retiring at the start of 2024. Jelinek, age 71, will be succeeded in the top job by current Chief Operating Officer (COO) Ron Vachris, a company veteran, as part of what the company says is a longstanding and orderly succession plan. Vachris, age 58, will become only the third CEO in Costco’s 40-year history. He assumes the CEO role on Jan. 1. COST stock is up 21% YTD.\\n\\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nConsumers tend to put a lot of their holiday purchases on credit cards, which is good news for American Express (NYSE:AXP). The credit card company tends to shine amid the frenzy of year-end shopping that takes place. In September of this year, American Express issued a report to its merchants called “7 Strategies to Capitalize on Traffic This Holiday Season.” The company also touts its various credit card rewards with consumers in the run up to the Christmas shopping period.\\n\\nThe company just issued third-quarter financial results that showed continued strength when it comes to consumers using its credit cards for purchases. American Express announced its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue, as well as a Q3 profit of $2.45 billion, or $3.30 per share. The profit figure was well ahead of the $2.96 a share in earnings that Wall Street analysts had forecast. The company said that its results got a lift from continued spending on the part of wealthy clients. Here’s hoping that continues through Christmas.\\n\\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nDiscount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) also tends to shine during the holidays as it too draws in consumers with year-end deals. The company and its stock could certainly use some positive news. Target most recently announced that it’s closing nine stores in major U.S. cities due to rising incidence of violence and organized retail theft. Target, which has nearly 2,000 stores in the U.S., is outspoken about organized retail crime and its financial impacts.\\n\\nWhen the company reported its Q2 earnings earlier this year, executives said theft is expected to reduce its full-year profitability by more than $500 million. The big-box retailer that competes directly against Walmart cut both its full-year sales and profit forecasts, saying consumers are refusing to spend on discretionary items at its stores. Unlike Walmart, Target is not a big player in the grocery space. Hopefully, the company and its stocks will get a lift from a year-end Santa Claus rally. TGT stock is down nearly 30% so far in 2023.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and MSFT.

Those numbers included initial sales of the vastly popular Mate 60 Pro, which began shipping in late August.\\n\\nHuawei, written off as a top smartphone player after the US cut it off from overseas suppliers in 2019, is mounting a comeback. It electrified the chip industry by unveiling the Mate 60 Pro housing a 7nm processor made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. That surprise revelation triggered celebration across China and accusations in the US that a campaign to contain the country’s technological ascent had failed.\\n\\nThe gadget sold out almost instantly, spurring expectations it could rejuvenate Huawei’s fortunes and potentially cut into Apple Inc.’s lead in China, given signs of a disappointing debut for the iPhone 15. Analysts including Haitong International Securities’s Jeff Pu have estimated Huawei could build as many as 70 million smartphones using its own Kirin chips in 2024 — not insignificant compared to the roughly 220 million iPhones that Apple ships annually.\\n\\nThe US won’t be able to stop Huawei and SMIC from making progress in chip technology, Burn J. Lin, a former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. vice president, told Bloomberg News. SMIC should be able to advance to the next generation at 5 nanometers with machines from ASML Holding NV that it already operates, said Lin, who at TSMC championed the lithography technology that transformed chipmaking.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn the run-up to the Mate 60 Pro’s debut, Huawei shored up its margins through a series of cost-cutting efforts. It also booked one-off gains from sales of the Honor smartphone business and a server unit in 2020 and 2021, it has said.\\n\\n“We continue to optimize our management systems, improve the efficiency and quality of our operations, and refine our sales strategy and product mix,” Huawei said in a statement. “These actions have had a very positive impact on our profit margin.”\\n\\nA resurgent Huawei would pose problems not just for Apple but also local brands from Xiaomi Corp. to Oppo and Vivo, all of which are fighting for sales in a shrinking market. Chinese smartphone shipments fell 6.3% in the third quarter led by local vendors, according to research firm IDC.\\n\\nBut the market could be bottoming out.\\n\\n“The Chinese market is expected to see its first year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter after more than two years, mainly driven by more intense competition and a low comparison base,” said IDC analyst Will Wong.\\n\\n(Updates with industry expert’s comment in the fifth paragraph)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto’s Epic Fall X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter’s Business Venezuela’s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat Li Keqiang: ‘Economic Openness Serves Everyone Better’ The War That Broke Social Media\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-profit-doubles-made-china-085028187.html', 'symbols': ['0981.HK', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'MKN2.F'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': -0.621, 'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.061}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Amazon (AMZN) Stock Leads &#039;Magnificent Seven&#039; Higher After Earnings', 'content': 'Amazon stock is inspiring a rally among the \"Magnificent Seven\" as AMZN investors react to the company\\'s latest earnings report.', 'link': 'https://investorplace.com/2023/10/amazon-amzn-stock-leads-magnificent-seven-higher-after-earnings/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'MSFT.US', 'NVDA.US', 'TSLA.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.813, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.656, 'pos': 0.344}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '7 Stocks Set to Soar in a Year-End Santa Claus Rally', 'content': 'Investors looking to boost their portfolios should consider positions in these popular companies as we near the year-end Santa Claus rally.', 'link': 'https://investorplace.com/2023/10/stocks-to-buy-for-a-santa-claus-rally-2/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'AXP.US', 'COST.US', 'TGT.US', 'WMT.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.671, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.224}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nDani Cook\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Oct 27, 2023\\n', 'content': \"These companies have powerful positions in tech, and you won't want to miss out on their growth potential.\", 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/27/got-1000-buy-these-hot-growth-stocks-before-they-t/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.669, 'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.646, 'pos': 0.304}}, {'date': '2023-10-27T00:00:00+00:00', 'title': '\\nSean Williams\\xa0\\xa0|\\xa0\\xa0Oct 27, 2023\\n', 'content': \"More than $249 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $335 billion of invested assets can be traced back to only five brand-name stocks.\", 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/27/74-warren-buffett-portfolio-invested-in-5-stocks/', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.178, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.078}}, {'date': '2023-10-26T23:31:00+00:00', 'title': 'United States International Trade Commission Issues Exclusion Order for Infringing Apple Watches, Finding that Apple Violated U.S. Trade Laws', 'content': 'Decision Holds World’s Largest Company Accountable for Its Patent Infringement\\n\\nWASHINGTON, October 26, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) today announced that the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) has recommended a limited exclusion order for infringing Apple Watches with light-based pulse oximetry functionality. The USITC found that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) violated U.S. laws by incorporating Masimo’s patented light-based pulse oximetry technology in its products. The exclusion is scheduled to go into effect after a 60-day Presidential review period.\\n\\n\"Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,\" said Joe Kiani, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Masimo. \"This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology,\" added Mr. Kiani.\\n\\nComments from two dozen academic institutions, leading antitrust and intellectual property scholars, physicians, investors, nonprofits, and members of Congress were filed in support of the public’s interest in the exclusion order. These comments conveyed a similar message: to protect innovation, such as Masimo’s technology, and to protect public health, it is necessary to preserve incentives to innovate and protect intellectual property and fair competition.\\n\\nIn its comment submitted to the ITC, the Consumer Federation of America stated, \"There is no greater offense to both the antitrust and intellectual property law than when a dominant firm infringes the patent of a smaller rival, who is an actual or potential competitor. In this case, as in the other cases involving Apple’s egregious abuse of market power, the harms far outweigh the benefit.

If you want to skip our introduction to the NASDAQ's performance this year and the broader stock market, then read 5 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2023.\\n\\nThe NASDAQ has been one of the best performing stock indexes not only in the U.S. but also in the world this year. The index, which was set up in 1971, is dominated by big technology stocks which include the largest companies in the world such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose shares are up by a whopping 193% year to date on the back of considerable hype surrounding artificial intelligence, is also listed on the exchange, and cumulatively, the strength of the big technology firms on the back of their ability to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) has done wonders for the NASDAQ when it comes to share price returns in 2023.\\n\\nIn fact, the first half of 2023 was quite remarkable on the economic front as well. This is because the U.S. economy continued to grow even as most analysts and economists had predicted that a recession was just around the corner. Naturally, the strong economy emboldened stock market investors, and their optimism was further fueled by the AI wave that we've mentioned above. For the NASDAQ, this enabled the index to post stunning returns. The stock index is primarily analyzed through the returns of the NASDAQ Composite index and the NASDAQ 100 index. The former consists of most of the stocks that are traded on the NASDAQ, while the latter is made up of the largest non financial firms listed on the NASDAQ in terms of their market capitalization.\\n\\nAs the first half of 2023 ended, the NASDAQ Composite and the NASDAQ 100 had gained 33% and 40%, which set a new record for the NASDAQ 100's performance during the first half of a calendar year. Their returns also surpassed the other two popular American indexes, namely the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P500, which had posted 3.87% and 16.51% in returns, respectively. The Dow's performance was striking in particular, as it drew a sharp contrast between the returns offered by an index designed to be a broader representation of the U.S. economy versus the NASDAQ 100 which is dominated by big tech firms. In short, while the tech sector flourished, the broader economy was still reeling from the effects of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes and high inflation.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBuilding on this, we also took a look at the top stocks on the NASDAQ being bought by hedge and highly rated by analysts during the first half of this year as part of our 15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today coverage. This revealed that the top three NASDAQ stocks among hedge funds and analysts as of March 2023 were Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), and WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:WSC).\\n\\nFast forwarding to October, the investing climate right now is far more muted than what was present during the first half. This is because most investors are worried that the Fed might continue to raise interest rates and that the economic climate could provide it both the incentive and the leeway to keep rates higher than expected. The labor market and inflation both continued to present trends that support this hypothesis for their September data, and fresh uncertainty was injected into the market in the form of the brutal conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine. A Middle Eastern conflict is one of the riskiest developments for the financial industry since it carries the potential to disrupt the global oil supply chain. This is particularly important in the context of 2023 since the market and the economy have already dealt a similar blow last year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian invasion shocked the global oil supply chain, caused crude oil prices to skyrocket, and led to rapid inflation\\xa0 - the effects of which are still being felt today in the form of high policy rates.\\n\\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell who remains the man of the hour for markets, is out with some fresh comments about the economy - the first after the Israel-Palestine conflict started. In remarks made at a luncheon at the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman shared that the economy might need more 'restraint' as he outlined:\\n\\nTurning to monetary policy, the FOMC has tightened policy substantially over the past 18 months, increasing the federal funds rate by 525 basis points at a historically fast pace and decreasing our securities holdings by roughly $1 trillion. The stance of policy is restrictive, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. Given the fast pace of the tightening, there may still be meaningful tightening in the pipeline.\\n\\nMy colleagues and I are committed to achieving a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor. Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.\\n\\nSo, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the best performing NASDAQ stocks in 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, often simply referred to as the Dow, is one of the most well-known and widely followed stock market indices in the US and around the world. The index tracks the performance of 30 companies that are publicly traded on US stock exchanges. These 30 companies come from various industries, making the index a diverse reflection of the stock market. Since the start of 2023, the index has declined by 0.25%, underperforming the S&P 500, which has gained 9.55% this year so far.\\n\\nThe Dow\\'s performance has been hurt mainly due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. In the US, the bond market was closed on the first trading day after the conflict began due to the observance of Indigenous Peoples\\' Day. However, when it reopened, investors turned to bonds as a safe-haven investment to shield their portfolios from geopolitical risks. Currently, the financial outlook is not optimistic. The S&P 500 is heading for its third straight month of losses, and the Dow has lost all its gains for the year. According to investors, those declines could continue if the war escalates or the economy begins to buckle under the pressure of rate hikes over the next few months.\\n\\nThat said, it\\'s worth noting that the Dow hasn\\'t always shown unstable performance. There have been times in the past when it outperformed the tech-heavy NASDAQ. This is particularly important to keep in mind because tech stocks have been the center of attention this year. In our article titled 12 Highest Yielding Dow Jones Dividend Stocks, we referred to data from Barron’s and highlighted that in 1978, 1980, and 1992, the Dow performed better than the Nasdaq by a margin of at least seven percentage points. The most notable period of Dow\\'s outperformance happened during the bursting of the dot-com bubble, with a total of 12 instances between 1999 and 2002.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAlso read: Dow 30 Stocks List: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index\\n\\nWhen looking at the long-term performance of the S&P 500 and the Dow, it is noticeable that they have generally shown similar performance trends. According to CNBC\\'s calculations, over the last 15 years, the S&P and Dow have moved in the same direction 94% of the time. Due to its emphasis on stable, dividend-paying companies, often referred to as \"blue chip\" stocks, the Dow has historically shown greater resilience during market downturns compared to other stock market indexes. In 2022, for example, the Dow only experienced a 7% decrease, whereas the S&P 500 saw a nearly 19% decline, and the Nasdaq dropped by 32%. Additionally, the Dow\\'s average dividend yield stands at 1.89%, surpassing the yields of the other two indexes.\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Apple Inc.

That’s what it takes to switch search engines. To explain it step by step, prosecutors called to the witness stand on Sept. 26 one of Apple Inc.’s most powerful executives, Eddy Cue.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nControversial Chip in Huawei Phone Produced on ASML Machine Apple Plans AirPods Overhaul With New Low- and High-End Models, USB-C Headphones Israel Is Losing Support as Fury Grows Over Its Strikes on Gaza What Happened Inside Morgan Stanley After Ted Pick Was Named CEO Tech Drags Down Stocks; Yields Drop on Fed Bets: Markets Wrap\\n\\nPresented with screenshots of an iPhone displayed on a flat screen, Cue sounded like a technician at the Genius Bar. “The Settings app, by default when you buy a new phone, is on the main screen,” he said. “When you tap on that Settings, you get a list.” He went on: “You tap on Safari, and then you have ‘search engine’ listed there. It would show you what the current search engine is that you’re using as the default. And then if you tap it, you get a list of choices, and you can pick any of them.”\\n\\n“Not a difficult process,” Cue said.\\n\\nSeen another way, it’s a labyrinth that most iPhone owners will never bother to enter and one that unfairly compounds Google’s lead over rivals such as Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, drives search startups out of business and enriches Apple, which earns billions of dollars annually for setting Google as the default. Whether or not the court agrees that Cue’s instructions are simple enough to follow will help determine whether Google faces legal consequences that could go as far as breaking up the company.\\n\\nThe trial, now about halfway finished with Google set to begin formally presenting its defense Thursday, is a trembling fault line jagging the tectonic plates of big tech. Much of the focus so far has been on hush-hush contract negotiations between top brass from the trillion-dollar club, including Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. But the lawsuit also offers a rare and revealing look at the incentives, often invisible to users, that have reshaped the ways we interact with technology.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nUS v. Google is the nation’s biggest antitrust case since Microsoft’s in 1998. That suit dealt with more straightforward allegations of anticompetitive behavior. Microsoft bundled its Internet Explorer browser with its dominant Windows operating system and pressured computer makers and web providers to adopt the application and cut off distribution of rival Netscape. Netscape’s popular Navigator browser, which retailed for $49 in the mid-1990s, was suddenly a hard sell after Internet Explorer came preinstalled for free on most new PCs. The Google case is more complicated because Google and most other search engines have long been free. The only real cost of switching, at least on an iPhone, is those four taps and one swipe. So the Google trial is, in a sense, about app design.\\n\\nLawyers for the government and Google have sounded at times over the past month of court proceedings like user-interface (UI) designers, with prosecutors debating the significance of iconography, toggle buttons and drop-down menus. While the government’s lawsuit is broadly about the legality of bundling services together to the detriment of consumer choice, the case is symbolized by a small arrangement of pixels on a screen.\\n\\nJohn Schmidtlein, Google’s lead litigator, argued that the company’s products have won because they’re simply superior to what the competition offers. Google’s default deals were inked chiefly on merit, he claimed, and users can change settings in “a matter of seconds.”\\n\\nSchmidtlein did his own walkthrough of Android and noted that the Google search widget can be removed from the home screen with a single “long tap” and another quick tap. “It's gone,” he said.\\n\\nYet, testimonies from Nadella and the founders of search startups DuckDuckGo and Neeva Inc. presented compelling arguments that a substitute can’t credibly compete with a default. Darin Fisher, who was the vice president of engineering for Google’s Chrome web browser until early 2021, said in an interview that the power of defaults is “massive.” (Fisher, who briefly worked at the defunct Neeva, didn’t testify in court, although his former boss did.) “The more things that require clicks and more scrolling and UI interactions, the more likely a user will not make it through,” Fisher said. “It’s design 101.”\\n\\nAnd the suggestion that Apple and Google design their systems to make it easy to switch defaults? “Oh my God,” Fisher said, “such bulls---.”\\n\\n‘A good user experience’\\n\\nThe origins of Google’s antitrust problems trace back to the mid-2000s. In the forever hunt for web advertising dollars, executives were looking for ways to expand Google’s reach through its own software and partnerships with Apple and Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser. And those negotiations over revenue sharing were intensifying as browser makers wondered how much Google was willing to pay to be the default search engine.\\n\\nGoogle has long presented itself as a champion of customization and choice. The internal push to nab preselections represented a wrinkle in this design philosophy. Pichai, who was leading development of Google’s Chrome web browser years before becoming CEO, was especially concerned about paying for preference, according to emails disclosed in the trial. “We should encourage them to have Yahoo as a choice in the pull down or some other easy option,” Pichai wrote to colleagues in 2007. “I don’t think it is a good user experience nor the optics is great for us to be the only provider in the browser.”\\n\\nAttorneys for Google argued defaults aren’t that effective anyway, citing examples of search distribution deals Microsoft struck with BlackBerry, Nokia and Verizon that failed to move the needle for Bing. People frequently went through the steps to switch to Google.\\n\\nYet, internal data muddies the story. Google research from 2007 disclosed in court showed that when users altered their browser homepage to a non-Google website, searches dropped 27%. The Justice Department claimed that 50% of every search conducted in the US is facilitated through a default purchase by Google.\\n\\nThe prosecution went to great lengths to highlight how Google’s dominance has handicapped a generation of search startups, including Neeva and DuckDuckGo, but it’s another trillion-dollar corporation, Microsoft, with probably the most to gain from a government victory in court. Which explains why its CEO was such a stalwart witness for the government’s case.\\n\\nIn his testimony, Nadella suggested there could be profound consequences for innovation in AI and whatever comes next if the tech industry continues on this path of paid-for software placements. He claimed Bing’s own attempts at paying for defaults failed because Microsoft was too late. Habits were hard to break when Google reached 97% market share on mobile: “You get up, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google,” Nadella said.\\n\\nNadella didn’t argue against defaults altogether. After all, Microsoft uses a similar system of promoting its in-house software. But Nadella accused Google of deploying its defaults to unfairly impair other companies. He gave an example of Google removing its app store if phone makers don’t set Chrome as the default browser on their Android devices. “That is the type of stuff that is impossible to overcome,” Nadella said. “Google has carrots, and it has massive sticks.”\\n\\nIt’s worth remembering that Microsoft effectively leveraged its dominance in similar ways as Nadella accused Google of doing, said Tom Evslin, a former product director at Microsoft in the early 1990s. If Microsoft hadn’t lost its grip on the browser and mobile markets in the following decades, it might still be engaged in the same practices. “For Microsoft to complain just because it’s been losing for a while seems to be somewhat hypocritical,” Evslin said in an interview.\\n\\nSchadenfreude is perhaps a more likely motivation for Nadella’s testimony. Prosecutors have said the case is just like Microsoft’s antitrust trial from the dot-com era, while Google’s Schmidtlein has argued the “facts could not be more opposite.” But certain similarities between the lawsuits are glaring. Internal Microsoft research from 1997 concluded that for Internet Explorer to beat Netscape, it needed to be bundled with Windows. Back then under Bill Gates, Microsoft had a colossal stick in Windows and was willing to use it on PC manufacturers and software developers to benefit Internet Explorer.\\n\\nMicrosoft had considered making AOL a default in Windows in exchange for AOL switching browsers to Internet Explorer, a bid to steal the 30% to 40% market share Netscape captured through the web portal. In a separate negotiation, Microsoft had told AT&T that it would consider adding a sign-up program for the telecom’s service only if AT&T gave Internet Explorer exclusive or highly preferential treatment — and a revenue-sharing deal.\\n\\nMicrosoft ended up losing its monopoly trial, but after an appeal the company settled in the early aughts with the Justice Department. The agreement required it in part to allow Windows to disable Internet Explorer.\\n\\nNadella used his testimony this month not just to stick it to Google but also to shine an unflattering light on Apple, which has drawn US antitrust scrutiny over its iOS mobile operating system and app store. “Would Google even exist if Windows had iOS-like restrictions on how things get distributed?” Nadella said.\\n\\nAt another point, Nadella wondered why Google was spending billions of dollars for defaults if the company really believed its search engine would win without them: “The question then is: Why does Google have to pay Apple?”\\n\\nApple defended its practice of selling default placement to Google by arguing that it’s “pretty easy” to change, as Cue argued in his testimony, and actually makes Apple products better. Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, claimed in court that it was Google’s search quality — not the $4 billion to $7 billion it pays Apple each year — that secured its place on the iPhone.\\n\\nCue talked about the sanctity of design at Apple and said he was not aware of any instance when Google restricted Apple’s ability to craft its own UI. Several apparent examples to the contrary came to light in court though. In one, a Google executive testified that the company complained about a visual change Apple had made to its iPhone search box in 2013. “They shrunk the box where you type in the query, and they grayed it,” said Joan Braddi, Google’s vice president of product partnerships. “We saw a dramatic drop in usage, and we told them about their UI changes, and they asked us for some recommendations to fix it.” In another instance, Apple considered offering users alternative defaults for search engines in its now-defunct Windows version of Safari if they downloaded it from a third-party service like Yahoo or AOL. However, Apple abandoned the idea after Google protested, according to Cue.\\n\\nApple’s design philosophy is to some extent anti-choice. “The more choices or the more options that you get, it frustrates customers,” Cue said. “They’re afraid of making the wrong choice.” This is exhibited throughout Apple’s mobile software, where users aren’t even given the option to change their default voice assistant from Siri to Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa or their navigation software to Google Maps.\\n\\nMicrosoft offers plenty of choice in Windows today but still elects to bundle software when it suits the company’s business interests. In response to overwhelming demand for its AI chatbot in February, Microsoft made an early preview of the product available only to those using its Edge browser and Bing.\\n\\nAs Google’s lawyers begin presenting their case this week, they’ll probably emphasize consumer choice in Google’s own software and how easy it is to switch search engines on other platforms. Pichai is expected to testify to that effect in the coming weeks. In an emailed statement, a Google spokesperson reiterated that it’s easy to change defaults on browsers and mobile devices. “On Windows computers — where Bing is the default and Microsoft makes it much more difficult to switch — the overwhelming majority of people still search with Google,” the spokesperson said. “And if people are having trouble changing their settings, they can always easily search how to do it with their preferred search engine.”\\n\\nFor a telling example of big tech’s design philosophy, consider printers. Apple, Google and Microsoft don’t make printers and have no profit interests in them. On the print screens in each company’s operating system, there’s no default manufacturer or secret revenue-sharing agreements for sales of ink cartridges. Rather, when you go to print something, there’s a list of options for HP or Epson or whatever product is plugged in. Pretty easy, right?\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto’s Epic Fall X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter’s Business Venezuela’s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher The War That Broke Social Media\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/case-break-google-hinges-four-110016090.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'BAC.F', 'BAC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.98, 'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.075}}, {'date': '2023-10-26T09:57:00+00:00', 'title': \"3 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation\", 'content': 'These companies have decades of offering stockholders consistent growth, making them attractive buys at almost any time.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4983f386-3ad8-3b7f-99c7-d10918cbd589/3-no-brainer-stocks-i%27d-buy.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.671, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244}}, {'date': '2023-10-26T09:30:05+00:00', 'title': \"Big tech earnings drove a stock market rally.

The economy has still shown resilience. And backed by a strong labor market and increasing manufacturing activity, the path to a soft landing remains.\\n\\nIn sum, this leaves markets in a \"spooky place,\" according to RBC Capital Markets\\' head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina.\\n\\n\"Though upside risks remain, downside risks have grown, the outlook has become cloudier and we don’t think the pause in the S&P 500 rally that we called for in early August is done yet,\" Calvasina wrote in a note on Monday.\\n\\nShe maintains a 4,250 call on the S&P 500, which would be about 1.5% higherfrom Wednesday\\'s close.\\n\\nAn earnings \\'famine\\'\\n\\nMarket strategists had hoped that earnings would be the catalyst to pull stocks out of their recent bond-drive rut.

Lai says he will maintain the status quo and that only Taiwan\\'s people can decide their future.\\n\\nSince the Global Times report came out, Gou\\'s team has declined to comment, referring questions to Foxconn itself.\\n\\nGou, 72, has continued to post on his Facebook account, but not mentioned the probe.\\n\\nLate on Tuesday, Gou posted about late Apple founder Steve Jobs, whom he called his idol, and how he \"cherished\" their relationship even with often tricky requests when it came to making iPhones.\\n\\n\"If I had thought of quitting because Steve Jobs was too picky and the tasks given by Apple were too difficult, and had given up on doing Apple orders, I would have probably lost a great opportunity to participate in Apple\\'s innovation in the future,\" he wrote.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"Think big, but don\\'t lose sight of details - this is the personality trait I noticed in Jobs.

After graduating from university, he worked in a series of factory jobs, as Taiwan in the late 1960s and early 1970s began using its cheap labour force to churn out consumer goods for the rich Western world.\\n\\nHe founded Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, better known as Foxconn, in 1974 with 11 elderly workers and a $7,500 loan from his mother.

The company is updating the products’ earbud design, the look of the cases and audio quality. A new version of the AirPods Max headphones are coming in 2024 as well, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.\\n\\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\\n\\nThe AirPods wireless earbuds were first introduced in 2016, when Apple began removing the traditional headphone jack from its devices. At the time, the product faced skepticism from consumers. Some were miffed about losing the cherished headphone jack. Others worried they would look strange wearing cordless earbuds, which were still a novelty at the time.\\n\\nBut Apple quickly overcame the concerns. The earbuds became one of the hottest consumer technology products, especially as a holiday gift. They’re also a popular add-on purchase when shoppers are buying a new iPhone. AirPods lead the wireless earbuds market, accounting for about 32% of sales last year, according to data from Canalys.\\n\\nWithin Apple, the AirPods are a key part of the company’s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment, which generates about $40 billion annually. That division, which also includes the Apple Watch and Beats headphones, is one of Apple’s fastest-growing and helps keep consumers from defecting to rival product ecosystems.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple currently sells three types of wireless earbuds:\\n\\nAt the low end, the company offers the second-generation AirPods for $129. They debuted in 2019. There are third-generation AirPods from 2021 at $169, a mid-tier offering. And the $249 AirPods Pro, last updated this year, are Apple’s upscale option.\\n\\nApple also sells pricey over-ear AirPods Max headphones. They launched in 2020 for $550 and have never been updated.\\n\\nThe third-generation AirPods haven’t sold particularly well for Apple. Many buyers either opt to save money and purchase the second-generation version or they spring for the high-end model, which comes with noise cancellation. The mid-tier product doesn’t offer much more than the $129 model, so some consumers don’t see a reason to pay the extra $40.\\n\\nRead More: The Shocking Success of Apple’s AirPods\\n\\nWith that in mind, Apple plans to phase out both the second-generation and third-generation AirPods later next year, according to the people familiar with the matter. They’ll be replaced with two fourth-generation AirPods that are priced similarly to the current versions but are more differentiated.\\n\\nThe two models will feature a new design that looks like a blend of the third-generation AirPods and the Pro model. They’ll both have short stems, the part that hangs out of a user’s ear.\\n\\nApple will differentiate the two options by including noise cancellation in the higher-end version. That model will also get an updated charging case that includes speakers for Find My alerts, matching the current AirPods Pro. Those alerts make it easier for users to find their case when it gets lost.\\n\\nBoth new low-end models will offer an improved fit, but it’s unlikely that either will include replaceable tips like the AirPods Pro.\\n\\nThe fourth-generation AirPods will also both switch to USB-C for their charging cases, continuing a shift that began with the AirPods Pro. The company dropped Lightning from its iPhones this year, part of an effort to comply with regulations from the European Union. And its accessories are following suit.\\n\\nApple is planning an update to the AirPods Max around the end of next year that also switches its charging port to USB-C. The headphones will come in new colors, but won’t see many other changes. The AirPods Pro, meanwhile, are expected to get a new design and chip in 2025, and the company is working on health features for that device tied to hearing.\\n\\nDespite the success of the AirPods to date, Apple can’t afford to coast. The company faces growing competition from companies like Samsung Electronics Co., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Xiaomi Corp.\\n\\nSony Group Corp., Bose Corp. and Jabra have also introduced more products in recent years, adding competition at the low end. And as Apple’s own experience in earbuds demonstrates, the market can change quickly.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nVenezuela’s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter’s Business No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher Lululemon’s Founder Is Racing to Cure the Rare Disease Destroying His Muscles Inflation Raging at 130% Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-plans-airpods-overhaul-low-171241983.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.822, 'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.058}}, {'date': '2023-10-25T17:04:38+00:00', 'title': 'Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Cut On Softening iPhone 15 Sales', 'content': 'A Wall Street analyst on Wednesday cut his price target on Apple stock amid reports of lackluster iPhone 15 sales.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d50e3cfa-e44d-35e4-b040-6f4275589ed5/apple-stock-gets-price-target.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': -0.273, 'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2023-10-25T16:21:00+00:00', 'title': 'Apple Raises TV Streaming Price to $9.99', 'content': 'Apple is raising the monthly price of its TV streaming service to $9.99, joining Netflix Disney and other companies that have recently increased prices.

This is the second round of price hikes in the past year, following similar increases in October 2022.\\n\\nYahoo Finance\\'s Seana Smith and Brad Smith discuss the trend across streaming platforms like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu, and Paramount+ (PARA), which have also raised prices to boost revenues amid rising costs.\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: Another price hike is coming to the streaming space. This time, from Apple. The company says Apple TV will now be $9.99 a month. That\\'s up from the previous $6.99. Now, this is noteworthy because we just had some of these price changes that were announced. And that was back in October of 2022.\\n\\nSo it seems like just a year later now, we\\'re seeing even more price increases. Just to run through some of them because it\\'s going to impact Apple TV plus, Apple Arcade, and Apple News plus, as well. Apple TV plus, $9.99 a month. We mentioned that. Apple Arcade, $6.99 a month. That\\'s going to be the new price. And Apple News plus, now, $12.99 a month.\\n\\nSEANA SMITH: And these changes take effect immediately. May I give one takeaway? It\\'s getting extremely expensive--\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: Yes.\\n\\nSEANA SMITH: --to be a streamer. And if you\\'re relying on those streaming services, you\\'re paying more and more and more, it seems like almost every month. Because Apple\\'s just the latest to join several of the other services in raising their prices. Taking a look at Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Discovery Plus, and Max have all raised their prices within the last year. So Apple TV plus following suit here. They\\'re doing this, obviously, to help revenue here.\\n\\nWe know that Apple TV plus is a growing segment, a growing division within the company. Obviously, higher prices are going to help their results going forward. Now, this is effective immediately, like, we just said, $9.99 a month now. Up from $6.99. We\\'re looking at a bit of pressure here on shares off just about 1%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut in terms of what this is going to do to subscriber churn, lots of questions about that. That has, obviously, been an issue with other streamers. They have, so far, it looks like at least from the results that we\\'ve seen over the last several quarters after some of their rivals have raised prices, they were able to offset some of the churn with those higher prices, with the higher average revenue per user, which is so critical for these companies. Whether or not Apple TV plus is going to be able to do that, I think it all comes down to content and whether or not people are willing to pay $9.99 for what\\'s on Apple TV plus right now.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: People at Yahoo make fun of me because I use Apple Music. Thankfully, for me, hey, hey, no increases there on that front.\\n\\nSEANA SMITH: Just yet.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah. Just yet. Yeah. That already happened last year. But Apple Fitness plus also has been remediated from this actual price increase that\\'s happened across some of the other. And then the Apple One bundle here-- this is interesting too prices for the Apple One bundles also increasing as a result. The individual ones are going to be $19.95 a month. Family, $25.95 per month. And then the Premier is going to be $37.95 per month based on these increases that have just come across for Apple TV, Arcade, and News plus here.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if you\\'re a go-to or a huge fan of any of these series that are out on Apple TV plus. But apparently, according to the Slack channel here, some fans of the [? service. ?]\\n\\nSEANA SMITH: I love \"The Morning Show.\" I paid for it for a while watching \"The Morning Show.\" Then they cancelled it. But now, I haven\\'t seen the second season-- or was it the second or third season? Whatever the new season is I haven\\'t watched it yet. So maybe I will be renewing my subscription. Although, $9.99 is a little bit more costly than just paying last year for $6.99.\\n\\nBut we talk about the spend. Obviously, Apple spending more and more on the streaming service. They\\'re trying to compete with the other competitors out there. So we\\'ll see what that\\'s going to do to subscriber numbers here going forward.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-unveils-second-streaming-price-154057157.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.992, 'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.914, 'pos': 0.073}}, {'date': '2023-10-25T15:26:16+00:00', 'title': '12 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child', 'content': 'In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best long-term investments for a child. To skip our detailed discussion on investment plans for kids and the importance of long-term investment horizon, click 5 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child.\\n\\n“My dad was my greatest inspiration. What I learned at an early age from him was to have the right habits early. Savings was an important lesson he taught me.”\\n\\n“Sometimes parents wait until their kids are in their teens before they start talking about managing money — when they could be starting when their kids are in preschool.”\\n\\n“Whether it’s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving — these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it’s best to help them to understand it.”\\n\\nAll these are the sayings of Warren Buffett, the best money manager and investor in the world. Like most successful people in the world, Buffett’s path to success started early in life, thanks to his parents.\\n\\nPerhaps one of the best gifts one could give to their child is helping them in achieving financial freedom early in life. Millions of Americans are struggling to buy a home, save for retirement, pay for education and cover basic expenses amid rising inflation and no savings. In a latest poll conducted by YouGov for Bankrate, about 56% of the respondents said they believe they are not able to save enough for retirement, while 37% them said they are \"significantly behind” when it comes to retirement savings. The ideal nest egg amount Americans believe required to live a comfortable life in retirement is also increasing. Americans now feel that need about $1.8 million to retire comfortably, a whopping $100,000 more than the nest egg amount estimated last year.\\n\\nAmericans are notorious for being heavy spenders and bad savers. This problem is exacerbated by the rising inflation that is not showing any signs of cooling down significantly. The Bankrate survey showed that 1 in 4 baby boomers and 1 in 5 Gen Xers said they are not saving enough for retirement this year and they did not save anything last year.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn this backdrop, it’s important to teach investing to kids and show them the importance of compounding. Analysts recommend average Americans to not only teach basic money management and investing to kids early in life, they also urge people to start stacking away small chunks of money for their kids. And this is where the magic of investing comes in. Instead of keeping money in your bank, it’s always useful to let it do the work out there and increase. A detailed research paper by the Connecticut Government has a revealing data point to establish the importance of investing. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings account for a “safe” 2% rate of interest, compounded annually. After 20 years you’ll have $7,430. But imagine you’d have put this $5,000 in one-year certificates of deposit (CDs) at the same bank, with instructions to roll over the proceeds into a new CD every 12 months. In addition, every month you also buy a $100 CD. After 20 years you’d have made 3.44% annually and $44,000 in total. See the difference.\\n\\nBut what if you were told that you could covert this $5,000 into $171,000 in the same time period (20 years) with minimal risks?\\xa0 The research paper says:\\n\\n“Since 1926, the stocks of large companies have produced an average annual return of about 10%. (Remember, that includes such lows as the Great Depression, the stock slide that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks and the financial crisis of 2008.) If we assume a long-term annual return of 8%, you’ll need to add $382 a month to the initial $5,000 to reach your quarter-of-a-million-dollar goal in 20 years. If you can earn 10% annually, $279 a month will do the trick.”\\n\\nWhen it comes to long-term investments for a child, a common advice from experts boils down to this: put your money in broader market indices and let the markets do the work for you. Since investing for kids gives you a long time horizon, by the time your kid comes of age, they’d have a sizable chunk of money thanks to the upward trajectory of the market.\\n\\nA McKinsey report provides some data which shows why it’s useful to invest in ETFs and mutual funds tracking the broader market:\\n\\n“In 2001, the market capitalization of the companies that made up the S&P 500 was about $10 trillion. As of mid-June 2022 (even after a bearish opening to the year), S&P 500 market capitalization was about $32 trillion. The mean total yearly returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 from 1996 to mid-June 2022 is 9 percent in nominal terms, or 6.8 percent in real terms—in line with historical results.\\n\\nThere were fluctuations, of course. The S&P 500 declined in 2000, 2001, and 2002, followed by a 37 percent fall in 2008 and a 22 percent fall in the first half of 2022. But from 1996 to mid-June 2022, S&P 500 returns declined annually only five times.\\n\\nThe lesson for investors? Don’t get sidetracked by short-term stock movements, which tend to stir up lots of headlines.” Best Long-Term Investments for a Child\\n\\nCredit: Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nFor this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires and compiled a list of all investment options that are deemed the best for a child in the modern world. Investing for your kid via these vehicles is not guaranteed to make them rich, but data shows that these investment vehicles do give people an edge and increase their wealth over longer time horizons.\\n\\nBest Long-Term Investments for a Child\\n\\n12.

Starting a 529 Plan\\n\\nA 529 college savings plan is a state-sponsored investment that you can use to save money for your kid’s education. You can withdraw funds tax-free to cover nearly any type of college expense. New regulations earlier this year paved way for 529 plans to be converted to Roth IRAs. People using 529 accounts usually set up small automatic payments from their bank to 529 to save up money for their kids’ education.\\n\\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO)\\n\\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) is one of the best ways to let the money work over the long term. The ETF invests in the S&P 500 Index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies.\\n\\nSome of the top holdings of the ETF include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most popular stock among the 910 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\\n\\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 300 hedge funds had stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The biggest stakeholder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) after Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management which owns a $4 billion stake in the company.\\n\\n8. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY)\\n\\nInvesting in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is another smart and easy way to gain exposure to the US stock market. The US stock market tends to go up over time, albeit slowly. The S&P 500 average return over the past decade has been around 12.39%, beating the long-term historic average of 10.7% since the benchmark index was introduced 65 years ago. You can invest in the broader index for your kid and by the time they grow up they’d have a decent amount to use for their education and other life expenses.\\n\\nA Business Insider report quoted\\xa0 Jordan Gilberti, CFP and senior lead planner at\\xa0Facet., who said:\\n\\n\"Investing can be a good way to grow wealth over the long term, and offers the potential for higher returns compared to a typical checking or savings account.”\\n\\n7.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\\n\\n6. Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)/Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) Accounts\\n\\nYou can open a custodial account under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) to hold gifts or transfers that a minor has received. The biggest benefit of using this kind of custodial account is that you don’t need to establish a trust to gift money to your kids. Transferring money to custodial account is free of any tax up to a certain amount. When you cross this limit, the effective tax rate is still lower than normal tax rate because the government uses minor’s tax rate instead of adult tax rate.\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\n12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and Employers Top 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World 23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023\\n\\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child is originally published on Insider Monkey.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-long-term-investments-152616994.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABBV.US', 'AMZN.US', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'BAC.US', 'CSCO.US', 'CVX.US', 'GOOG.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA', 'PFE.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 1, 'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.114}}, {'date': '2023-10-25T15:09:00+00:00', 'title': \"Apple is making a change to its subscriptions users won't like\", 'content': 'Apple has been steadily pushing into the subscription business for years now, building robust products that more than one billion people are using, according to the tech titan.

Google-parent Alphabet Inc. said Tuesday that interest income almost doubled to more than $1 billion, while Tesla Inc. saw the line item soar to $250 million.\\n\\nWhile not huge numbers relative to overall earnings, the gains have been one constant amid otherwise volatile results that have so far failed to assuage investor concerns about the companies’ larger prospects. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 were falling early Wednesday after Alphabet’s disappointing quarter stirred worry about Meta Platforms Inc., which reports after the close.\\n\\n“They’re not as affected by rising interest rates because their debt is relatively small relative to their cash flow. And then they’re also sitting on a lot of cash and they’re earning 5% or more on all that money,” said Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research Inc. “The idea that rising interest rates are bad for growth stocks, especially technology companies, needs to be reassessed here to recognize that’s not necessarily true if they happen to be very profitable companies with stellar balance sheets.”\\n\\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is still sitting on 35% gains year-to-date, versus an 11% climb for the S&P 500. While equities have fallen across the board from July’s peak, the Nasdaq 100 has only dropped about 5% over the past three months while the S&P 500 has fallen roughly 7%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMicrosoft Corp. and Alphabet on Tuesday reported revenue that topped analyst forecasts, though shares of the Google parent fell on disappointment with its cloud-computing sales. Meta is set to post third-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the market close.\\n\\nAfter shrinking last year, profits for the five largest S&P 500 companies are projected to rise 34% in the third quarter and to also have accelerated in the last three months of the year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Wendy Soong at Bloomberg Intelligence.\\n\\nWhile interest expenses for S&P 500 companies have gone up, “the biggest companies with the most cash live in a different world,” according to Ed Clissold and Thanh Nguyen at Ned Davis Research. For instance, Meta, Microsoft, Adobe Inc. and Nvidia have made $979 million more in non-operating income in the past four quarters than they spent on interest expenses, according to data through the end of June. In other words, they are profiting from the inverted yield curve.\\n\\n“It kind of flies in the face of the long-duration asset discussion over the last few years. I don’t know of a single growth manager that owned a fast-growing company because they did a discounted cash flow model that said ‘buy this stock,’” said Clissold, who is chief US strategist at the firm. “So I never really thought that was a reason for growth stocks to underperform, and the fact they’ve done well this year in the face of rising interest rates proves the point.”\\n\\nWhile megacap tech stocks may be skating past the rising-rate environment, the same can’t be said for their smaller peers. The Nasdaq 100 has outperformed the small-cap Russell 2000 by 39 percentage points so far this year, on track to be the biggest margin since 1999.\\n\\nSome degree of that outperformance can be traced back to balance-sheet worries and refinancing risks for smaller companies. Just 2% of firms in the S&P 500 had weighted average maturities in the two-years-or-sooner timeframe at the end of the second-quarter versus 10% among small-cap companies, RBC Capital Markets research shows.\\n\\n“There’s been a mentality change in addition to an overall structure-of-debt change across the large-cap space. I think that’s going to be an OK environment for 2024,” Kate Moore, BlackRock’s head of thematic strategy for global allocation, said on Bloomberg Television’s The Close. “We need to look at companies today and really take a good look at each of their own balance sheets, each of their own financing, each of their own cash-flow prospects instead of saying with a knee-jerk reaction ‘higher policy rates are a bad thing for higher-multiple or growth companies.”’\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nMicrosoft reiterated its investment case by bringing in $33 billion in cash in the latest quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As a result, the Redmond, Washington-based company leapfrogged Alphabet to rank second among non-financial S&P 500 companies by cash on hand — behind Apple, which has $167 billion in cash and marketable securities.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nAlphabet’s cloud computing unit reported a smaller-than-expected profit, raising concerns about the company’s position in a market that is critical to its future. Shares of Alphabet fell as much as 7.2% in late trading. Microsoft posted its strongest sales increase in six quarters, bolstered by recovering cloud-computing growth amid demand for new artificial intelligence products that are prompting corporate customers to shift back into spending mode. Snap Inc. returned to revenue growth in the third quarter after two periods of declines, showing the long-running improvements to its digital advertising business are finally paying off. The company cautioned, however, that the progress may be blunted in the current period by advertiser delays spurred by the war in Israel and Gaza. Apple is poised to roll out new Macs on Oct. 30 in what will likely be the iPhone maker’s last launch event of 2023. SiFive Inc., a chip technology startup that’s received investments from Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., said it’s cutting about 20% of its workforce in a “strategic refocusing of all of our global teams.”\\n\\nEarnings Due Wednesday\\n\\nPremarket\\n\\nAmphenol Teledyne Roper Postmarket\\n\\nIBM Meta Platforms T-Mobile ServiceNow KLA Teradyne Flex Pegasystems Plexus MaxLinear Impinj Ultra Clean Imax\\n\\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein, Tom Contiliano and Subrat Patnaik.\\n\\n(Updates with pre-market moves.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nVenezuela’s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter’s Business No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher Lululemon’s Founder Is Racing to Cure the Rare Disease Destroying His Muscles Inflation Raging at 130% Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surging-yields-flip-burden-boon-130308086.html', 'symbols': ['1SI.F', '1SI.XETRA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'SNAP.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.993, 'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.098}}, {'date': '2023-10-25T10:20:00+00:00', 'title': \"Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $333 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock\", 'content': \"Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) is a massive conglomerate that owns a sizable public equities portfolio.

Lai says he will maintain the status quo and that only Taiwan\\'s people can decide their future.\\n\\nSince the Global Times report came out, Gou\\'s team has declined to comment, referring questions to Foxconn itself.\\n\\nGou, 72, has continued to post on his Facebook account, but not mentioned the probe.\\n\\nLate on Tuesday, Gou posted about late Apple founder Steve Jobs, whom he called his idol, and how he \"cherished\" their relationship even with often tricky requests when it came to making iPhones.\\n\\n\"If I had thought of quitting because Steve Jobs was too picky and the tasks given by Apple were too difficult, and had given up on doing Apple orders, I would have probably lost a great opportunity to participate in Apple\\'s innovation in the future,\" he wrote.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"Think big, but don\\'t lose sight of details - this is the personality trait I noticed in Jobs. This is the trait in recent years I have come to expect in myself and encourage in every colleague around me.\"\\n\\nFoxconn said in a statement on Sunday legal compliance was a \"fundamental principle\" of its operations, and it would \"actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations\".\\n\\n\\'TAIWAN\\'S CEO\\'\\n\\nGou has positioned himself as \"Taiwan\\'s CEO\" saying he wants to unite a fractured opposition amid rising tensions with China, which he blames on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party\\'s (DPP) hostility to Beijing.\\n\\nThe DPP-led government has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing, but been rebuffed, and has blamed China for the tensions.\\n\\nBut Gou has languished in the polls and the two main opposition parties, the Kuomintang and Taiwan People\\'s Party, have instead been talking to each other about a possible joint ticket, though those talks have foundered.\\n\\nGou was not born wealthy. After graduating from university, he worked in a series of factory jobs, as Taiwan in the late 1960s and early 1970s began using its cheap labour force to churn out consumer goods for the rich Western world.\\n\\nHe founded Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, better known as Foxconn, in 1974 with 11 elderly workers and a $7,500 loan from his mother. He first made cheap plastic parts for black-and-white television sets for a Chicago TV manufacturer, before a major deal in 1980 making joystick connectors for Atari games consoles.\\n\\nIn 2000, Foxconn won an order to make Apple\\'s redesigned iMacs, after making a variety of parts for the likes of U.S. personal computer vendor Dell.\\n\\nFoxconn eventually became one of the world\\'s largest private-sector employers with at times over a million workers assembling devices for global brands such as Sony Corp, Nintendo Co Ltd and Microsoft Corp.\\n\\nGou remains a lauded figure at Foxconn after stepping down as chairman in 2019, referred to reverentially as \"the founder\".\\n\\nHis connections reached as high as Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he met in 2014 in Beijing, and whom in 2017 he described as a great leader, Taiwan media reported.\\n\\nGou\\'s parents were born in China and were of the generation that fled to Taiwan after the Communists won China\\'s civil war in 1949, a year before Gou\\'s birth on the island.\\n\\nIn an interview with the Communist Party\\'s official People\\'s Daily in 2018 to mark China\\'s 40th anniversary of landmark economic reform, Gou said he was happy to have witnessed the changes.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gou vowed to start negotiations with China if he was elected president on the basis that both sides belong to one single China but each can interpret what that means.\\n\\nStill, in August when announcing his run he struck a tougher tone when asked if his Foxconn shareholdings meant China could simply tell him what to do if he became president.\\n\\n\"I have never been under the control of the People\\'s Republic of China,\" he said. \"I don\\'t follow their instructions.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Sonali Paul)', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newsmaker-foxconn-founder-terry-gou-063555003.html', 'symbols': ['2317.TW', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'HHP2.F', 'HNHAF.US', 'HNHPF.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.99, 'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.087}}, {'date': '2023-10-25T01:30:00+00:00', 'title': '3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Dependable Dividend Growth', 'content': 'Back in 2020, Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel opined that dividend stocks represent the only protection against inflation. Even with tight monetary policies, inflation has remained stubbornly high. To maintain purchasing power of money, it’s important to remain invested in some of the best dividend stocks.\\n\\nAhead are three dividend growth stocks to buy at attractive valuations. Indeed, the dividend payout and yield in these stocks may be significantly higher in the next five years. Further, capital gains from these stocks will consistently beat index returns. Clearly, total return is likely to be attractive for these dependable dividend growth stocks.\\n\\nLet’s discuss the business factors that will support earnings growth and cash flow upside.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock has been depressed with lithium trending lower in 2023. However, the selling seems to be overdone with ALB stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.3. Further, a dividend yield of 1.15% is attractive, making robust dividend growth likely in the coming years.\\n\\nThe key reason to consider ALB is the company’s expansion plans. As of 2022, Albemarle Corporation reported lithium conversion capacity of 200ktpa. The company has guided for almost tripling of lithium conversion capacity by 2027. Further, ALB expects sales volume growth at a CAGR of 20% to 30% through 2027.\\n\\nIf this capacity expansion is coupled with lithium trending higher, the result will be sustained growth in cash flows. This is reason to be bullish on the long-term outlook for lithium considering the impending supply gap. Therefore, ALB stock looks attractive from a dividend and capital gains perspective.\\n\\nChevron Corporation (CVX) chevron stock\\n\\nSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has been in the news after the company announced a $53 billion Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) takeover.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Chevron reported net-debt of 7% as of Q2 2023. This provided CVX with high financial flexibility for the acquisition. Also, the company expects to invest $19 to $22 billion annually after the completion of the acquisition, ensuring healthy growth in operating cash flows.\\n\\nNotably, in 2022, Chevron reported operating cash flow of more than $45 billion. During the year, Brent oil averaged $100.9. If oil trades around $90 to $100 per barrel, the combined entity is likely to deliver OCF of more than $50 billion.\\n\\nTherefore, Chevron will be positioned to pursue aggressive investments, increase dividends, and continue with share repurchase.\\n\\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\\n\\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a massive value creator over the years, likely to remain in a long-term uptrend. At the same time, the company has high financial flexibility to increase dividends at a healthy rate. In the last five years, Apple has reported dividend growth at a CAGR of 6.69%, and could well accelerate further in the next five years.\\n\\nFor Q3 2023, Apple reported revenue of $81.8 billion. Services revenue swelled to record highs with over one billion paid subscriptions. Further, the wearables, home, and accessories segment has ample room for growth driven by product innovation and a wide addressable market. Operating cash flow is likely to remain robust, which will in turn support dividends.\\n\\nRecently, it was reported that Apple will be investing $1 billion annually towards generative artificial intelligence products. There continues to be speculation around Apple car, which seems to be slated for launch in 2026.

The chip is as much as twice as fast as a similar 12-core processor from Intel, while using 68% less power, Qualcomm claims.\\n\\nThe announcement is the latest sign of an increasingly competitive market for computer processors. Nvidia Corp. is working on its own central processing unit — the brains of a PC — using chip designs from Arm Holdings Plc, people familiar with matter said earlier this week. And Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel’s longtime rival in computer processors, is developing a new CPU with Arm technology as well.\\n\\nWith Snapdragon X, Qualcomm looks to wow the industry with far speedier performance. It claims the new chip can run 50% faster at peak times than Apple’s M2, which that company has touted as the leading computer processor on the market.\\n\\n“This will make us the new CPU leader in mobile computing,” said Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala. “It will deliver leading performance with low cost and low power.”\\n\\nThe San Diego-based company’s stock gained as much as 1.5% following the announcement. Qualcomm shares have lagged a general rally by semiconductor equities this year, hurt by sluggish demand in its main market: smartphone chips.\\n\\nQualcomm will have to show it can back up these bold assertions if it wants to make inroads in the PC market. Intel’s technology, which AMD licenses for its own processors, remains dominant in the industry.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSo far, only Apple’s in-house designs have gained significant ground at the expense of that standard, and its share of industry shipments only recently passed 10%.\\n\\nSnapdragon X stems from Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon’s 2021 purchase of startup Nuvia Inc. That company, founded by former Apple executive Gerard Williams, brought Qualcomm new chip designs and helped make it less reliant on off-the-shelf technology from Arm.\\n\\nRead More: Qualcomm Buys Server Chip Designer Nuvia for $1.4 Billion\\n\\nIn addition to general advantages in performance, the new processor will have features specifically designed for artificial intelligence software, Qualcomm said. The chipmaker has argued that AI will only reach its full potential if it migrates out of data centers and into end-user devices, such as phones and PCs.\\n\\nNvidia is the leader in data center chips that speed AI computing, and its own efforts to push into PC processors should intensify competition. That company’s PC offering, along with the new Arm chip from AMD, are expected as early as 2025.\\n\\nIntel, meanwhile, finds itself under attack in a market that it dominated since the 1980s. That company, still one of the world’s largest chipmakers, is trying to regain its footing with a huge investment in new technology under CEO Pat Gelsinger.\\n\\nSeparately, Qualcomm announced a new version of its Snapdragon 8 lineup for smartphones.

In anticipation of the readout, Monness’ Brian White, a 5-star analyst ranked in the top 1% of Street experts, thinks investors should prepare for “headwinds across the portfolio.”\\n\\n“In our view,” White said, “the combination of a downtrodden economy plagued by pernicious inflation, an emboldened Huawei, a new iPhone family with only incremental updates, and the maturity of the smartphone market, paint a bleak picture for iPhone trends.”\\n\\nNevertheless, the fact all four models that make up the iPhone 15 lineup became available on the same date (9/22) during the September quarter vs. last year when only three models in the iPhone 14 lineup saw a mid-September launch followed by the October 7 release of the iPhone 14 Plus, means White expects a year-over-year “revenue tailwind in 4Q:FY23 from the cadence of this year’s iPhone rollout.”\\n\\nAs such, White is forecasting iPhone revenue to climb by 2% from the same period a year ago to $43.41 billion, thereby improving on the 2% drop witnessed in 3QFY23 but lower than the 10% growth notched during the same quarter last year.\\n\\nThat said, while White applauds Apple’s “high-quality, aesthetically pleasing, industry-leading smartphones,” given a shaky macro backdrop, combined with a “mature market,” he sees an uninspiring iPhone 15 cycle in the offing. Additionally, for the quarter, White sees dwindling YoY sales for the Mac (down 23%), iPad (down 10%), somewhat countered by Services sales rising 15% to $22.06 billion.\\n\\nWhite’s estimates, however, are above consensus. He is calling for FQ4 revenue of $90.50 billion, amounting to a modest 0.4% YoY increase and just higher than the Street at $89.25 billion. On the bottom line, White predicts EPS of $1.44 vs. the consensus estimate of $1.39.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDespite the expected headwinds, then, White’s overall take is positive as he keeps a Buy rating on the shares to go along with a $208 price target, suggesting shares will post 12-month growth of 21%. (To watch White’s track record, click here)\\n\\nWhere do other analysts stand on AAPL? Overall, 21 Buys and 9 Holds have been issued in the last three months. Therefore, AAPL gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Given the $205.30 average price target, shares could surge ~19% in the next year.

I’ve written several articles about Warren Buffett stocks in the past year.\\n\\nIt’s hard not to do when Berkshire had $147 billion in cash available as of June 30. After all, the company has to do something with all that money. I’m paid to generate actionable ideas for readers.\\n\\nI saw an article from October 16 in Bloomberg about Kohler, the kitchen people. The privately held business was exploring the sale of its generator division. Estimates put the business value at $3 billion.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nTo me, that is the ultimate Buffett business — boring and profitable. The only problem for Berkshire is that $3 billion is too small an acquisition. It has to go big or go home.\\n\\nThe easier route for Berkshire is to buy a big position in a large company. Building the position will take a while, but at least it’s not competing with private equity and alternative asset managers to buy companies with higher-interest debt.\\n\\nIn some ways, Berkshire has become a closed-end investment fund. Here are three stocks for Buffett to add to his quasi-closed-end portfolio.\\n\\nDanaher (DHR) The logo for Danaher (DHR) displayed on a smartphone with a stock chart in the background.\\n\\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nIt’s been over three weeks since Danaher (NYSE:DHR) spun offVeralto (NYSE:VLTO), its Environmental & Applied Solutions operating segment. Danaher shareholders got one new VLTO share for every three held in the parent.\\n\\nDanaher did the spinoff to focus on its life sciences and diagnostics businesses. It has a history of building operating units and separating them from the parent. In 2016, it spun off Fortive (NYSE:FTV) and Envista (NYSE:NVST) in 2019.\\n\\nMorningstar.com reported on Danaher’s future without Veralto shortly after the spinoff. It stated the company has some near-term headwinds that will affect its revenue and earnings growth into 2024.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHowever, the source is confident about Danaher’s long-term future, suggesting the company will return to normalized growth in 2025 and beyond with high single-digit revenue and low-double-digit earnings growth.\\n\\nOf the 27 analysts covering Danaher stock, 21 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a median target price of $250, well above its current share price.\\n\\nDanaher’s free cash flow in the trailing 12 months ended June 30 is $7.2 billion. Based on an enterprise value of $162 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 4.4%. I consider anything between 4% and 8% growth at a reasonable price.\\n\\nThis would be an excellent addition to Berkshire’s equity portfolio.\\n\\nWalt Disney (DIS)\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nThere is no question the current situation at Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is less than ideal. Its shares are trading at their lowest point since 2014. CEO Bob Iger is facing a second barrage from activist investor Nelson Peltz, the company’s legacy TV assets are holding it back and a profit at its direct-to-consumer streaming business still needs to happen.\\n\\nDisney shareholders might have gotten some good news on Oct. 23. Reports surfaced that India conglomerate Reliance Industries is very close to buying Disney’s India business. The sticking point is the valuation. Disney believes the assets are worth $10 billion; Reliance feels that number is more like $7 billion to $8 billion. It’s possible the sale could be announced sometime in November.\\n\\nSignificant issues that Iger is working on include reducing overhead, getting Disney+ profitable, and figuring out how to transition ESPN from cable to digital without losing too much of the brand’s goodwill.\\n\\nThere have been plenty of rumors about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) buying all of Disney or possibly just ESPN.\\n\\n“’The sports streaming wars are heating up as Apple, Amazon, YouTube and Peacock vie to create the next ESPN,'” former media exec Aden Ikram wrote last month for Fortune. ‘Some analysts believe Apple should just acquire ESPN and put its many leagues on streaming,’” Fortune reported.\\n\\nInterestingly, Buffett already had a long relationship with ABC, having first acquired shares in Capital Cities Communications in 1977, shares of ABC in 1978, and then 18% of the merged entity of Capital Cities/ABC after the former acquired the latter for more than $3.5 billion in 1985.\\n\\nBerkshire and Apple together can do a deal for Disney. Stranger things have happened.\\n\\nFastenal (FAST) Fastenal (FAST) logo displayed on a mobile phone\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI’m a hockey fan. Of course, why wouldn’t I be? I live in Canada, after all.\\n\\nI did not realize that Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) is the official supply chain partner of the NHL. Further, the company sponsors all the NHL Global Series European games and the NHL’s primetime international broadcast series, NHL Saturday and NHL Sunday.\\n\\nWhen I think of Fastenal, I think of it as a wholesale industrial distribution business selling industrial products to companies and organizations worldwide. However, it’s more than that. The company is also a supply chain and logistics consultant, a technology support business and many other things that sometimes get lost in the story.\\n\\nOne thing is clear about the Minnesota-based company: it maintains steady revenue and earnings growth.\\n\\nIt reported Q3 2023 results On October 12. They were good as always, with revenue 2.4% higher than last year, to $1.85 billion, while its net earnings were $295.5 million, 3.8% higher than a year ago. Its operating margin is a healthy 20.9%.\\n\\nAs I said, steady, if not spectacular, growth.\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2023, it did something Buffett loves: it paid out $599.5 million in dividends. That was up from $534.4 million a year earlier. It has not repurchased any of its shares in 2023, unlike the first nine months of 2022, when it bought back $144.6 million of its stock.\\n\\nWhile it did not buy back any of its stock in the first nine months, it did reduce its total debt by nearly $300 million, down to 7% of total capital from 14.9% a year earlier.\\n\\nFastenal is the quintessential Buffett stock.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It would tackle things like fake reviews and subscriptions that are difficult to break.\\n\\nFines for breaching the new rules could be as high as 10% of a company’s global revenue. In Apple’s case, that would represent more than a $39 billion fine, based on 2022 earnings.\\n\\n“The present mobile environment is a far cry from the more open and level playing-field that existed when I started building companies,” Ek said.\\n\\n“It also makes me wonder whether launching a venture like Spotify would even be feasible today. My guess is no.”\\n\\nIn June, the world’s biggest tech companies, including Apple, Google, and Meta, argued the bill would create “significant business uncertainty” because it is too vague and would give regulators unreasonable power.\\n\\n“These conditions create an extremely volatile regulatory environment risking significant disruption to the UK economy, including by chilling investment,” the submission to the committee read.\\n\\n‘A secret 30% tax on everything’\\n\\nEk’s comments are the latest in a recent press round where he has reminisced about the difficulties of starting his music streaming platform, which is now valued at $30 billion and boasts 220 million global subscribers.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSpeaking to Steven Bartlett on the Diary of a CEO podcast, Ek said he initially thought a streaming service was a “terrible idea” in an age of proliferating pirated music. He later recalled how he lost all his hair and gained 30 pounds as he spent years trying to secure licensing agreements with some of Europe’s biggest record companies.\\n\\nNow, Ek says he is trying to convince the government to push through the bill to help current start-ups become more competitive in the tech sector.\\n\\nThe main source of Ek’s ire was Apple, and in particular, the 30% fee the company charges some developers including Spotify for app sales, in-app purchases, and paying for a subscription. Google also charges some developers a 30% fee on its own app store.\\n\\nEk wrote in the MailOnline: “How many more start-ups would have succeeded and grown into successful businesses if Apple wasn’t extracting this rent and reaping massive rewards at the expense of the broader tech economy?”\\n\\nApple has said approximately 90% of developers on its app store don\\'t pay a commission to the company, while European developers who qualify for the group\\'s small business program and sell less than $1 million in digital goods and services pay a 15% commission.\\n\\nEk\\'s pursuit against Apple with the European Commission was previously narrowed in February to exclude a request for the removal of charges for digital goods and services. Apple says it has always embraced competition, with Spotify among its most popular third-party music streaming services.\\n\\nIn an email to Fortune, Apple pointed to a comment it made in February 2023 when the Commission narrowed the scope of the Spotify case: “The App Store has helped Spotify become the top music streaming service across Europe and we hope the European Commission will end its pursuit of a complaint that has no merit.”\\n\\nEk has his own stakes in tech’s battle with Apple, whose music streaming service Apple Music is regarded as Spotify’s main competitor.\\xa0The company has been in a lengthy dispute with Apple over how it sells audiobooks.\\n\\nIn response to Apple\\'s remarks, a representative for Spotify told Fortune: \"Whatever success we’ve had at Spotify has happened despite Apple’s best efforts to sabotage our efforts, raise our costs and gain an artificial advantage – first for Apple Music and now with audiobooks.\"\\n\\nAmazon, another company involved in the dispute, has its own streaming service challenging Spotify. Google is building its own subscription model through YouTube, which could cut into Spotify’s market share.\\n\\nHowever, the Spotify co-founder is far from alone in criticizing what he perceives as a stranglehold on the competition by tech’s big players, which are worth trillions of dollars in combined market value.\\n\\nLast year, Elon Musk delayed the launch of Twitter Blue, now X Blue, blaming Apple’s 30% commission. In an exchange on X last October, he said the fee was “literally 10 times higher than it should be.” He called it a “secret 30% tax on everything” that effectively fell on consumers.\\n\\nIn February, the Biden administration echoed Musk’s arguments, with the Commerce Department recommending Apple and Google “address limits on in-app purchasing,” including making developers use the iOS App Store or Google Play Store for any purchases. The companies told Bloomberg they disagreed with the findings.\\n\\nThere are some 5.5 million apps on Google\\'s and Apple’s app stores.\\n\\nAmazon, Google, and Meta didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-says-115912267.html', 'symbols': ['639.F', '639.XETRA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'SPOT.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.863, 'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.085}}, {'date': '2023-10-24T11:27:08+00:00', 'title': 'Chinese retailers are already slashing the prices of the iPhone 15 by over $100 amid reports of a sluggish launch for Apple’s latest smartphone', 'content': 'Retailers in China are already slashing prices of the newest iPhone, just over a month after its release.\\n\\nSellers on Chinese e-commerce platforms like Alibaba\\'s Taobao and JD.com are offering discounts on Apple\\'s latest iPhone 15 ahead of \"Singles Day,\" the Nov. 11 shopping festival that now covers several weeks.\\n\\nPrice cuts on the two sites ranged between RMB 300 to over RMB 1000 ($41–$137) below Apple\\'s official retail price in China, according a check of the results by Fortune.

Most recently, the iPhone maker has grappled with new rules from Beijing requiring any program sold on Chinese app stores to be approved by the government. That could remove thousands of foreign apps from Apple\\'s Chinese store.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple CEO Tim Cook made a surprise trip to China last week, including meeting with senior Chinese officials like Wang Wentao, China\\'s commerce minister, and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.\\n\\nThe company also faces renewed competition from Huawei. Counterpoint Research in a separate report noted that the domestic phone manufacturer was one of the few brands to record year-on-year growth last quarter, primarily driven by the Huawei Mate 60 phone and its new, potentially sanctions-evading, processor.\\n\\nHuawei is targeting the premium smartphone market at a lower price point. While the specifications of Apple\\'s and Huawei\\'s phones are different, the base model of the Mate 60 retails at about $752, compared to the iPhone 15\\'s base price point of $821.\\n\\nSingles Day\\n\\nThe mega shopping event of Singles Day is perhaps the next big indicator of how Chinese consumption is recovering. Though it was once an unofficial \"anti–Valentine\\'s Day\" for single friends to meet up, companies like Alibaba have transformed the date of Nov. 11 into a multi-week-long shopping frenzy. Singles Day sales have regularly surpassed those of Black Friday in the U.S.\\n\\nSingles Day sales for Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall begin on Tuesday, and the e-commerce giant is expecting to attract about 1 billion consumers this year.\\n\\nChinese consumer spending post-pandemic is recovering at a slower-than-hoped-for pace.

Owning the whole thing, however, means he has a greater say in the company’s capital allocation. Buffet has a four-point plan when buying a business. It must:\\n\\nBe a business he understands Have good, long-term growth prospects Have a solid management team Be offered at an attractive price\\n\\nAmong the businesses Buffett owns outright through Berkshire are Dairy Queen, GEICO, BNSF Railway and NetJets.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThese are the same fundamentals he says investors should look for when buying stock. He believes investors have an advantage because the stock market possesses a larger universe of businesses to choose from and offers greater opportunities for finding discounts. But there are some stocks Berkshire Hathaway owns that are a middle ground from completely owning the company and having a share in their growth potential. The following Warren Buffett stocks are ones he owns at least 25% of.\\n\\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\\n\\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a relatively recent addition to Warren Buffett stocks. Berkshire Hathaway started accumulating shares in the exploration and production (E&P) stock in March 2022 and except for a brief pause last summer, he hasn’t stopped.\\n\\nOccidental now accounts for 4.4% of Berkshire’s total value. However, the 224.1 million shares worth $2.95 billion at current prices represent 25.3% of the oil company’s outstanding shares. The Oracle has permission from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) to buy as much as 50% of Occidental’s shares. Buffett also owns $10 billion worth of OXY preferred stock.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBuffett doesn’t think we’re anywhere near peak oil. Demand for fossil fuels remains large and growing. Occidental’s position in the Permian Basin means the oil company has strategic importance in the country’s biggest oil region. According to the Federal Reserve, the Permian is responsible for 40% of all U.S. oil production. It’s why Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) just agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) for $59 billion.\\n\\nAs Buffett put it, buying Occidental is “a bet on the fact that the Permian Basin is what it is cracked up to be.” But it likely also has to do with the E&P play paying a generous dividend. Although the common shares yield just 1% annually, the preferred stock yields 8% giving Berkshire Hathaway around $960 million in annual income.\\n\\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A photo of both the Kraft and Heinz logo\\n\\nSource: Eyesonmilan/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nPackaged foods leader Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is another stock that is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s biggest bets, but still only represents about 3% of the portfolio’s total value. Buffett’s total stake in the ketchup maker, however, makes him its biggest investor. Berkshire owns 26.5% of the outstanding stock, or 325.6 million shares worth $10.2 billion. It’s also one of the only Warren Buffett stocks that the Oracle of Omaha believes was a mistake.\\n\\nBuffett and private equity firm 3G Capital Management paid $23.3 billion for H.J. Heinz in 2013. Each put in $4.4 billion, but Buffett also spent an additional $8 billion to acquire its 9% preferred stock (I’m sensing a theme here). The two companies then orchestrated the Heinz takeover of Kraft Foods two years later for $49 billion.\\n\\nWhere Buffett felt as though the Heinz deal was a good one, he says he overestimated Kraft. He told CNBC in 2019 that although the combined company is still “a wonderful business,” he misjudged various operations. “We overpaid for Kraft.”\\n\\nEarlier this year Kraft Heinz agreed to pay investors $450 million related to the merger. The settlement makes it one of the 100 largest class-action lawsuits of all time. It paid an additional $62 million to the SEC for similar allegations of misconduct.\\n\\nShares of Kraft Heinz are down almost 24% year to date. While the stock goes for just 10 times next year’s earnings estimates and a fraction of its book value, it still trades at more than twice sales, and earnings growth for the next five years is only forecast to expand 5% annually. Buffett, though, has said he has no intention of ever selling his Kraft Heinz stock.\\n\\nDaVita (DVA) A DaVita (DVA) kidney care clinic in St. Joseph, Missouri.\\n\\nSource: APN Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhere Apple is Berkshire’s number 1 holding, Buffett actually owns more of kidney dialysis specialist DaVita (NYSE:DVA) than any other company. The 36 million shares worth $2.95 billion equate to a massive 39.5% stake in the business.\\n\\nThere’s a good chance, however, that Buffett isn’t the one who bought DaVita for Berkshire. It’s likely Ted Weschler, one of his portfolio managers, who initiated and then increased Berkshire Hathaway’s stake. Weschler reportedly owned the stock through his Peninsula Capital Advisors hedge fund between 2003 and 2011. That’s when he was hired at Berkshire and also marks the first time Berkshire owned DaVita stock. It’s easy to see why he likes it.\\n\\nDaVita is one of the two largest dialysis centers in the U.S. It generates 91% of its revenue from dialysis and two-thirds of its operating profits. DaVita serves around 200,000 patients a year, giving it a 36% share of the market.\\n\\nOn the surface, compared to other Warren Buffett stocks, this option looks cheap. Shares trade for 10 times estimates, a fraction of sales, and a bargain basement 5 times the free cash flow it produces. However, the dialysis center is also heavily in debt. It has $8.6 billion in long-term debt and $2.4 billion in operating leases compared to just $340 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. In this high-interest rate environment, DaVita’s debt service is going to be much more expensive.\\n\\nWhile shares are up 5% year to date, they’re down over 40% from 2021 highs. I’m not sure we’ll see Berkshire Hathaway adding to its position even at these seemingly discounted levels.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in XOM stock.

The Oracle of Omaha has a concentrated portfolio of high-quality stocks purchased in moments when they were relatively inexpensive.

The reason is simple: buybacks are similar to dividends in that they provide cash to shareholders, although they are subject to different tax rules. But, if a buyback is executed at an attractive valuation — that is, if the bought-back shares are underpriced — the value of shares held by all remaining shareholders can increase.\\n\\nDon't miss\\n\\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years.

Yahoo! Finance reports the iPhone maker also spent another $18 billion on buybacks in its most recent quarter.\\n\\nIn 2016, Buffett started investing heavily in Apple while the dividend and buyback program was in full swing.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a consistent buyback and dividend, this $2.7-trillion juggernaut should certainly be on your watch list.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRead more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how\\n\\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\\n\\nAlphabet is reliably profitable, but has shown no indication of any interest in dividends. It is, however, much more amenable to buybacks.\\n\\nGoogle’s parent company has regularly repurchased shares since at least 2018. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced a massive share buyback program in 2022, worth $70 billion. This program was renewed with another $70 billion in April. That’s one of the largest buyback programs in corporate America, nearly as big as Apple’s $90-billion program announced in March.\\n\\nTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO)\\n\\nTractor Supply Company isn’t a high-profile tech company like the other two stocks on this list, but it is a generous buyback firm. The Tennessee-based company offers agricultural products through its network of retail stores spread across the country.\\n\\nThe stock’s 2% dividend yield isn’t particularly impressive, however, its buyback program certainly is. Total shares outstanding dipped from 123 million in 2018 to 112 million at the end of 2022. The company’s management expects to deploy $575 million to $675 million in share repurchases in 2023, approximately 2% of the company’s outstanding shares. Forbes Advisor estimates the company’s shareholder yield as a result of buybacks to be above 4%.\\n\\nThe fact that it’s underrated on Wall Street makes it even more appealing.

Israel’s war against Hamas has made risk assets a more dangerous bet. And the Federal Reserve’s next moves hang over it all. Still, with virtually nowhere else to turn in the equity market, Big Tech remains the most-crowded trade among fund managers, according to Bank of America Corp.\\n\\nThat’s prompted investors to pay up for protection against a selloff in Alphabet and Microsoft — two of the handful of heavyweights responsible for all of the S&P 500 Index’s advance this year. Investors are banking on them to deliver earnings growth big enough to push the stocks higher — or at least enough to justify this year’s gains.\\n\\n“There is no room for them to falter whatsoever,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners. “If you think about the amount of money that’s gone into index investing, particularly the S&P 500, if any one of these companies falter then there’s going to be selling pressure because everyone and their brother is overweight.”\\n\\nThe five biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index — all of them tech-related — generated the bulk of the index’s 10% gain this year. Add in a couple of other heavyweights like Tesla Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., and that’s all of this year’s advance and then some. Bank of America’s fund manager survey showed last week that betting on more gains for Big Tech is seen as the most crowded trade.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTheir earnings have been a key support: They’re expected to deliver average profit growth of 34% in the third quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The rest of the S&P 500 is expected to show a profit drop of about 5%.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s and Alphabet’s results will be followed by Facebook owner Meta on Wednesday and e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday. Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are due to release results next month.\\n\\nWith so much riding on the group, there have been signs of skittishness among investors ahead of the week’s results, given the broader market’s retreat since August. Apple and Nvidia have each dropped more than 10% from recent peaks amid concerns about sales in China, which is locked in an ongoing tussle with the US over advanced semiconductor technology. Electric-vehicle maker Tesla has declined 13% after a disappointing earnings report last week.\\n\\nOther hints lie in the options market. The cost of puts — which protect against declines in a stock — relative to the cost of calls — which profit if a stock rises — has climbed for megacap tech shares. That signals investors are increasingly seeking protection from share-price drops in the near-term. That’s a reversal from earlier in the year, when desire to chase upside in the stocks pushed up the cost of calls instead.\\n\\nWhen Microsoft reports, much of the focus will be on the performance of its Azure cloud computing business, where sales are expected to rise 27% compared with the same period last year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Alphabet will give investors a glimpse into the rebound in the market for digital advertising that accounts for the majority of its revenue. The Google owner’s total sales are projected to rise 10%, which would be its best growth in five quarters.\\n\\nBoth Microsoft and Alphabet are seen as front-runners in generative artificial intelligence. So far, the technology hasn’t been a major contributor to financial results. However, analysts are expecting that to change in the coming year, making forecasts particularly crucial.\\n\\n“We’re looking for reasons for the market to turn around and start to advance again,” said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt. “Given how prominent big technology companies are in terms of contribution to total earnings, the reports for big tech earnings could be a catalyst to turn the market positive.”\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nTwo of the most profitable firms kick off the big tech earnings week after markets close on Tuesday as Microsoft and Alphabet report. Meta and Amazon are slated to report later in the week. The four mega-caps combined generated $53 billion in profits last quarter.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nNvidia Corp. is using Arm Holdings Plc technology to develop chips that would challenge Intel Corp. processors in personal computers, ratcheting up competition between the two semiconductor makers, according to people familiar with the situation.

Beijing’s surprising investigation of Foxconn Technology Group, Apple Inc.’s largest iPhone assembler, is stoking fears about founder Terry Gou’s business empire as he pursues Taiwan’s presidency. Rebellions Inc. aims to raise about $100 million from global investors to accelerate the development of a next-generation AI chip, banking on growing interest in the hardware needed to run artificial intelligence services.

The movie represents a strategic shift for Apple as the company more heavily leans into theatrical exclusive titles — films exclusively distributed in movie theaters, usually for over a month — to drive subscribers to its flagship streaming service Apple TV+.\\n\\nIn 2021, the movie industry deployed multiple experiments to combat the pandemic, primarily through hybrid streaming releases where a film would debut both in theaters and also through streaming platforms.\\n\\nThat was the case for 2022 Best Picture winner \"Coda,\" which Apple acquired for $25 million at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival. The film had an incredibly limited theatrical release in the US, debuting in just about 100 theaters, while simultaneously appearing on Apple TV+.\\n\\nBut studios including Apple have largely reversed that strategy as media companies more heavily favor lucrative box office dollars to subscriber numbers — the exception being Netflix (NFLX), which has committed to streaming-only releases. (Source: Apple TV+)\\n\\nThat means the return of the exclusive theatrical window, or period when theaters have the exclusive rights to a piece of content. Post-pandemic, that window has settled at around 45 days.\\n\\n\"This certainly signals a transition period for [Apple] in terms of how they\\'re going to approach content, especially with big prestigious productions and A-plus list talent like Leonardo DiCaprio and Marin Scorsese,\" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, told Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nThe film, which was distributed by Paramount (PARA), notched $44 million in its global debut this past weekend — a lukewarm opening considering its estimated $200 million-plus price tag but still a notable feat given its long run time, coupled with the ongoing actors\\' strike.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe movie will eventually air on Apple TV+ once its theatrical run is complete, although the company has yet to reveal when that will be.\\n\\n\"Studios have certainly remembered how valuable that theatrical window is — and that includes new players like Apple,\" Robbins said.\\n\\n\\'A win win\\'\\n\\nApple has pledged to spend $1 billion producing movies for theaters. That bet, which includes upcoming titles like Matthew Vaughn\\'s \"Argylle,\" and Ridley Scott’s \"Napoleon,\" matches rival Amazon (AMZN), who formulated similar plans to invest in box office releases last year.\\n\\nAmazon closed its $8.5 billion deal to acquire MGM in March 2022 and saw major success with the release of \"Creed III\" earlier this spring.\\n\\n\"Both companies recognize this is a big part of where their bottom lines can lean on in terms of theatrical representation, and eventually, that\\'s going to help their streaming libraries down the road,\" Robbins said, noting box office releases often serve as the first window of profitability for films.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a win win to be able to embrace both sides. ...Theatrical films still stand out in a way the streaming titles don\\'t,\" he added.\\n\\nAnother benefit for Apple lies within its various revenue streams, with the bulk of its revenue stemming from iPhone sales — not the success of its films studio.\\n\\n\"Unlike other studios, this is a smaller piece of the pie for Apple,\" Robbins said, explaining that luxury of flexibility allows the company to experiment with different types of distribution windows and even different types of films.\\n\\n\"This is a very risk averse industry,\" the analyst continued, noting a company like Apple is often more appealing to A-list actors and directors who\\'d prefer to pursue more passion projects as opposed to big blockbuster films. \"Apple has historically proven itself to be one of those companies that takes risks.\"\\n\\nOne company that has yet to embrace the box office boom is Netflix (NFLX). Instead, the streamer has taken on the exact opposite approach.\\n\\n\"We are in the business of entertaining our members with Netflix movies on Netflix, so that’s where we focus all our energy and most of our spend,\" Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during a company earnings call last year. The platform has yet to pivot from that stance.\\n\\nNetflix has played some original features in theaters, including 2018 breakout hit \"Roma,\" along with more recent films like \"The Gray Man,\" \"The Irishman\" and \"Don\\'t Look Up.\" However, those debuts had very short theatrical windows with much more limited releases than \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\\n\\n\"At this point, Netflix feels more and more like a minority out of the major streamers in terms of how they\\'re approaching their big production feature films,\" Robbins said.\\n\\nBut avoiding the theater is a strategic play for Netflix, too, with its management team consistently reiterating the box office does little to help its streaming-first mission.\\n\\n\"Driving folks to a theater is just not our business,\" Sarandos previously said. \"Having big new desirable content drives value for our members and drives value for our business.\"\\n\\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Although in some region, lead times have been falling, Evercore’s iPhone tracking endeavors show the data points to “stable demand for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models vs. a year ago across most geographies.” That said, the past week has seen lower-end models’ lead times display “big contractions.”\\n\\nOverall, according to Daryanani, USA lead times are “tracking in-line vs. a year ago while China is slightly weaker.”\\n\\nSpecifically, in the US, deliveries for the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Pro are expected between November 13th – 28th and November 6th – Nov 13th, respectively. This represents time to first delivery of 28 days for the Pro Max and 21 days for the Pro.\\n\\nThe estimated delivery window for the iPhone 15 Plus and 15 is from October 23rd to November 6th and from October 23rd to November 1st, respectively, with both models having a time to first delivery of just 3 days.\\n\\nAs for China, the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Pro are expected to be delivered in 3-5 and 2-3 weeks, respectively, which translates to a time to first delivery of 21 days for the Pro Max and 18 days for the Pro. On the other hand, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus have delivery estimates for October 22nd, with a time to first delivery of just 2 days.\\n\\nDaryanani also notes that, on average, over the past week, the Pro Max model’s lead times in the UK and Germany have been lower.\\n\\nHowever, summing up, Daryanani’s last thoughts on the data are reassuring. “Finally, we would also caveat that delivery times could be a reflection of strong demand or weak supply – though we suspect given the variation in wait times that this data set more likely suggests higher demand,” he opined.\\n\\nAll told, Daryanani reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on AAPL, backed by a $210 price target, suggesting shares will climb 21% higher in the year ahead.

The Federal Reserve\\'s decision to raise interest rates at least once again this year and the growing geopolitical tensions globally have resulted in volatility levels spiking again.\\n\\nLarge-cap stocks typically deliver relatively stable returns during periods of heightened volatility and can be great for investors aiming to minimize risk.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)?', 'content': \"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$196 and falling to the lows of US$170. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$173 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nWhat Is Apple Worth?\\n\\nAccording to my valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 7.70% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $160.52, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Apple’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\\n\\nCan we expect growth from Apple?\\n\\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Apple's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 21%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat This Means For You\\n\\nAre you a shareholder? AAPL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\\n\\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AAPL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\\n\\nIf you'd like to know more about Apple as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

AMGN, Becton, Dickinson and Co. BDX, UnitedHealth Group UNH and Verisk Analytics VRSK.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, Amgen and Becton, Dickinson\\n\\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Apple, Amgen Inc. and Becton, Dickinson and Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\\r\\n\\r\\nApple shares have outperformed the broader market this year (+34% vs. +12.8% for the S&P 500 index) and roughly matched the Zacks Tech sector (+34% vs. +34.8%). The company expects iPhone and Services’ year-over-year growth to accelerate in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the June quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple launched four new iPhone models at its product launch event on Sep 12. Demand for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max is strong as shipment delivery has reportedly slipped to mid-November. It also upgraded Airpods and made iOS 17, watchOS 10, iPadOS 17 and tvOS 17 available.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and robust adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Arcade are helping drive subscriber growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline double digits on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter due to difficult comparisons.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nShares of Amgen have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9.7% vs. -20.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recently completed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is expected to enhance Amgen’s growth prospects. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen’s products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimate movements have been mixed ahead of Q3 results.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nShares of Becton, Dickinson have gained +2.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry’s gain of +12.2%.

As we wrote previously, Apple\\'s App Store ecosystem is a $1-trillion-a-year industry unto-itself, that helps generate astonishingly high returns on capital for the Company. Many growth investors have shunned Apple for years, despite this unparalleled growth, considering it still, just a \"hardware company.\" However, we do sympathize with that assessment, somewhat, plus the stock’s historically richer valuation, if only evidenced by our weighting in Apple - despite being almost 8% - it is still just three-quarters of the double-digit weighting Apple carries in one of the more popular growth benchmarks.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPixabay/Public Domain\\n\\nApple Inc.

Major tech earnings in focus this week\\n\\nThe third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.\\n\\nOverall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.\\n\\nThis general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.\\n\\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ:META) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports on Thursday.\\n\\nThose stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500\\'s 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.\\n\\n4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report\\n\\nFoxconn (TW:2354), a major supplier of Apple\\'s iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.\\n\\nThe tabloid said some of Foxconn\\'s key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China\\'s natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.\\n\\nThe public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan\\'s next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.\\n\\n\"We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,\" Foxconn said in a statement,\\n\\nFoxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.\\n\\n5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy\\n\\nCrude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.\\n\\nBy 05:45 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.\\n\\nBoth contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world\\'s biggest oil-supplying region.\\n\\nIsrael has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.\\n\\nThat said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially hitting supply in the important region.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nTreasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings - what\\'s moving markets\\n\\nBank of Canada to leave rates on hold as economy stalls, analysts say\\n\\nMood swing: Global producers in US hunt for China alternatives', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings-043314313.html', 'symbols': ['2317.TW', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMZN.US', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOOGL.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'HHP2.F', 'HNHAF.US', 'HNHPF.US', 'IXIC.INDX', 'META.US', 'MSFT.US', 'NVDA.US', 'TSLA.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': -0.982, 'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.047}}, {'date': '2023-10-23T03:00:00+00:00', 'title': 'Tim Cook Can’t Make iPhones Without This Chinese Company and Its CEO', 'content': 'Apple is increasingly reliant on China-based Luxshare for manufacturing amid U.S. tensions with Beijing.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/80f4df88-dbdc-3940-bc3a-a04222d6afc3/tim-cook-can%E2%80%99t-make-iphones.html', 'symbols': ['002475.SHE', '2354.TW', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': -0.296, 'neg': 0.148, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.082}}, {'date': '2023-10-23T01:42:41+00:00', 'title': 'China Rattles Foreign Firms Again With Arrests, Foxconn Probe', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Chinese authorities are again shaking the confidence of foreign companies in the country with a series of arrests and an investigation into Foxconn Technology Group, Apple Inc.’s most important partner and one of the largest employers in China.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nIsrael Latest: Oil Declines as Hostage Talks Delay Gaza Invasion Car Owners Fall Behind on Payments at Highest Rate on Record US Push for Release of Hostages Delays Israeli Ground War, But Won’t Stop It Saudi Arabia Mulls Buying Dassault Combat Jets, Tribune Says Moderna Shaves Off $7 Billion in Value After Pfizer Warning\\n\\nOver the weekend, state media said that regulators are conducting tax audits and reviewing land use by Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that makes the vast majority of iPhones at factories in China. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Foxconn’s public arm, said it will collaborate with authorities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, an executive and two former employees of WPP Plc, one of the world’s biggest advertising companies, have been arrested in China, people familiar with the matter said. The government detained a local employee of a Japanese metals trading company in March, the Nikkei newspaper reported Sunday. And this month, a court formally charged an Astellas Pharma Inc. on suspicion of espionage.\\n\\nHon Hai, Foxconn’s main listed arm, fell the most in more than three months Monday. Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., a major Shanghai-listed subsidiary, plunged its 10% daily limit — its biggest loss on record.\\n\\nChina often does not explain the actions taken by its regulators publicly, leaving companies with operations in the country guessing at the ultimate goals of the government. Given the Communist Party’s immense power, that opaque approach to oversight of the economy has unsettled foreign executives. The Japanese trading company worker was detained in March and there is still no public acknowledgment of or clarity about the specific charges.\\n\\n“My sense is that the core of the leadership really worries about foreign influence as dissent, among elites, is growing,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis SA. “It is not a signal for foreigners. It is a signal for the elites: don’t follow that path.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWith China struggling through a housing crisis, Xi Jinping and his administration have been trying to signal support for the private sector, seeking help in stabilizing the world’s second-largest economy. Perceptions of the party’s economic stewardship suffered during years of Covid lockdowns and a brutal crackdown on the technology industry, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and co-founder Jack Ma.\\n\\nFoxconn is a similarly surprising — and enormous — target. The company has been at the foundation of China’s growth as a high-tech manufacturing base and, with the Apple halo, a symbol of the opportunities for other companies in the country. Tesla Inc., for example, has now made China a key base for its electric-vehicle production.\\n\\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited China last week, meeting with Commerce Minister Wang Wentao to declare their support for “win-win” collaborations. The Apple chief’s rare visit follows a move by Beijing to ban some staff at government agencies and state-owned companies from using Apple’s marquee iPhone for security reasons. The latest iPhone 15 is also off to a disappointing start in China after Huawei Technologies Co. stunned the market with the 5G-capable Mate 60 phones.\\n\\n“The part of the leadership dealing with the economy and attracting foreign capital is not in the driving seat,” said Garcia Herrero. “So they can only watch and hope to minimize the damage by announcing opening of certain sectors.”\\n\\nIn the current investigation, tax authorities are conducting checks on Foxconn subsidiaries in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces, the state-run Global Times said Sunday, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. The report also said natural resources officials are looking into the company’s use of land in Henan and Hubei provinces.\\n\\nNo further details of the investigations and tax checks were provided in Global Times’ report. Hon Hai didn’t give specifics either in a filing with Taiwan’s stock exchange. Foxconn’s Zhengzhou plant, known as iPhone City, is located in Henan.\\n\\nFoxconn billionaire founder Terry Gou resigned from the company’s board last month as he campaigns to become president of Taiwan. The campaign referred questions to Foxconn. He previously dismissed claims he would be susceptible to Chinese pressure, were he to win January’s election.\\n\\n“I will not bow to China’s threats,” Gou said at the August briefing announcing his presidential bid. Name-checking key customers including Apple, Tesla and Amazon.com Inc., he said any halt to production due to political pressure would disrupt supply chains — something China would need to explain to the world.\\n\\nLai Ching-te, Taiwan’s vice president and presidential election frontrunner, voiced support for Hon Hai at a campaign event Sunday.\\n\\n“China shouldn’t force Taiwanese companies to declare their position whenever an election is taking place,” he said. “China should acknowledge Taiwanese companies contribute to its economy greatly.”\\n\\nBeijing has been intensifying its scrutiny of Western businesses amid growing geopolitical tensions. In March, authorities raided New York-based due diligence firm Mintz Group’s office in Beijing and detained five of its Chinese employees. In April, Bain & Co. confirmed that Chinese authorities had questioned staff at its Shanghai office.\\n\\nThe following month, Chinese state security officials visited a branch of Capvision, a consulting firm with headquarters in New York and Shanghai.\\n\\n--With assistance from Thomas Seal and Mark Bergen.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nLululemon’s Founder Is Racing to Cure the Rare Disease Destroying His Muscles Inflation Raging at 130% Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path The Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease Treatments The Price of Money Is Going Up, and It’s Not Because of the Fed UBS Looks Beyond Credit Suisse to Bank Even More Billionaires\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-rattles-foreign-firms-again-014241600.html', 'symbols': ['2317.TW', '601138.SHG', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'HHP2.F', 'HNHAF.US', 'HNHPF.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': -0.984, 'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.056}}, {'date': '2023-10-23T01:06:01+00:00', 'title': 'iPhone Assembler Hon Hai Dives After China Starts Probes', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. fell its most in more than three months after Beijing launched a series of investigations into its operations in China, targeting a key Apple Inc. supplier and one of the country’s largest employers.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nIsrael Latest: Oil Declines as Hostage Talks Delay Gaza Invasion Car Owners Fall Behind on Payments at Highest Rate on Record US Push for Release of Hostages Delays Israeli Ground War, But Won’t Stop It Saudi Arabia Mulls Buying Dassault Combat Jets, Tribune Says Moderna Shaves Off $7 Billion in Value After Pfizer Warning\\n\\nThe Taiwanese firm, which makes the majority of the world’s iPhones from its factories in central and southern China, slid 3.4% in early trading Monday.\\n\\nFoxconn is Apple’s most important assembly partner, cranking out millions of iPhones a year from a giant complex in Zhengzhou known as iPhone City.

music royalties: 'We want people to have access'\", 'content': 'There\\'s a new way to make money in the music industry — and it involves betting on your favorite songs.\\n\\nEarlier this month, investing platform Public offered retail investors the opportunity to own a piece of the rights to the \"Shrek\" soundtrack for the same price as an expensive cup of coffee.\\n\\nThe company purchased the 768-track catalog outright, put it into an LLC, and then had that LLC go public so investors could buy shares for as little as $10 — something that\\'s become known as \"fractionalized royalty investing.\"\\n\\nInvestors can trade shares with other users on the Public platform, but the company said it\\'s likely, given the cash-flowing nature of the royalty asset, that buyers will be long-term investors.\\n\\n\"It really starts with this approach of being retail first and you\\'re seeing a big change in the industry,\" Keith Marshall, general manager of alternatives at Public, told Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nPublic co-CEO and co-founder Leif Abraham added: \"We want people to have access to multiple sets of asset classes.\"\\n\\nRoyalty investing has existed before — but it was largely reserved for wealthier institutional investors like hedge funds who could afford to shell out six figures or more on song catalogs.\\n\\n\"If we can bring liquidity to royalties broadly then we can make songwriters, artists, producers richer and expand the possibilities of what they could do with their career and their art,\" said Gary Young, CEO of Royalty Exchange, a marketplace that connects those who want to sell their intellectual property (IP) with buyers.\\n\\nArtists flooded the platform in 2020 to seek out potential investors as an alternative way to make money through the sale of song royalties, which are income generators paid in return for IP or simply the use of that IP.\\n\\nFor an artist, their songs are their IP and royalties are payments made to that artist whenever their song is played on the radio or streamed on music streaming services like Spotify (SPOT) or Apple Music (AAPL).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n\"Most people have some general idea that a royalty is part of copyright law. It\\'s something for creators to get paid based on things that they\\'ve created,\" Marshall said. \"But at the end of the day, it just ends up being a payment — that\\'s the simplest way to look at it. It\\'s a means that someone has a legal right to receive payment for content being consumed.\"\\n\\n\\'The next big thing\\' There\\'s a new way to make money in the music industry — and it involves betting on your favorite songs. (Getty Creative) (Guido Mieth via Getty Images)\\n\\nSong royalties can come in two different forms — master recordings, or the recordings of an actual song, and music publishing, which encompasses the copyrights for songwriting and composition, such as lyrics and melodies.\\n\\nAlthough publishing rights are often not worth as much as actual recordings, they can still lead to a significant amount of revenue over time with radio play, advertising, movie licensing, and more.\\n\\n\"We want people to have access to multiple sets of asset classes.\"Leif Abraham, Public co-CEO and co-founder\\n\\nPublic said the \"Shrek\" royalties, which fluctuate depending on play frequency, generated an annualized dividend yield above 8% in both 2021 and 2022. To compare, the current yield on the 10-year Treasury note generates about a 5% return.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all about building this idea of a balanced, modern portfolio and that comes back to diversification,\" Marshall said. \"You’re really trying to build a portfolio with the least correlation between your different asset classes. That\\'s where music comes in. It’s driven by content consumption that has nothing to do with the Fed’s moves on interest rates.\"\\n\\nThat means investors can earn passive income independent from traditional markets.\\n\\n\"It\\'ll be interesting to see how these \\'fractionalizations\\' go,\" Royalty Exchange\\'s Gary Young said. \"That\\'s probably the next big thing. It\\'s already starting to happen, but the question in my mind is, \\'What\\'s the scale? And can people bring a lot of these songs or catalogs of songs to market in an affordable way?\\'\"\\n\\n\\'The perfect storm\\'\\n\\nAffordability of more well-known catalogs will be the biggest hurdle, especially as more artists have sold the rights to their music catalogs for hundreds of millions over the past several years.\\n\\nThe dominance of streaming services has been a major factor in increasing the value of those music rights with experts saying streaming has provided greater stability within the industry as consumers can more easily access songs — leading to more returns for artists.\\n\\n\"The key is that the business has become predictable,\" said Guillermo Page, a former record label executive who worked for Sony and Universal. \"[Investors] can trust in the future of the business because it\\'s growing. When you eliminate the uncertainty, it opens up a new door for investors to come in and snap those assets.\"\\n\\nPage, who now teaches in the music program at the University of Miami, added catalog sales are also a huge benefit to artists, especially older ones.\\n\\nIn December 2021, Bruce Springsteen sold both his master recordings and publishing rights to Sony Music in a deal worth north of $500 million, according to multiple outlets. The Red Hot Chili Peppers sold the rights to its song catalog for a reported $150 million that same year.\\n\\nIn 2020, Bob Dylan sold over 600 copyrights to Universal Music Group in a deal reportedly valued at over $300 million. Prior to that, Stevie Nicks sold a majority stake in her songwriting for a reported $100 million.\\n\\n\"The older a song is, generally, the more consistent the income stream,\" Young noted.\\n\\nBut even younger artists are cashing in on the trend. Most recently, Katy Perry sold the rights to her song catalog for $225 million in September while Justin Bieber sold his entire music catalog for over $200 million earlier this year.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the perfect storm for artists who can now maximize their return on the sale of those assets,\" Page said.\\n\\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Its deal with Major League Soccer (MLS) appears to be paying off. It\\'s rumored to be bidding on Formula One (F1) and NBA rights.

Rather, he wanted a deal that would allow Apple to control \"how to present [the game], deliver it, and use technology.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe MLS deal allowed for that flexibility — giving Apple full control of all of the league\\'s matches globally.\\n\\nAnd then the incredible happened. Argentinian soccer legend Lionel Messi signed an MLS deal with Inter Miami.\\n\\nMessi joining the US-based league led to a surge in ticket sales, sports apparel, and, most importantly, sign-ups to Apple\\'s streaming package MLS Season Pass.\\n\\nAccording to analytics platform Antenna, 110,000 users signed up for the package on the day of Messi\\'s debut, representing a 280% increase from the number of sign-ups generated on the first day of the 2023 season.\\n\\nThe Messi effect helped Apple achieve something unique within the sports world — a niche superstar that fed into the company\\'s \"less is more\" strategy, coupled with an international component that benefits the company\\'s global push.\\n\\nStill, Cue told GQ he didn\\'t initially think MLS would be \"big enough\" to satisfy the tech giant\\'s ambitions, alluding to the potential for bigger deals down the line. That could come with Formula One.\\n\\n\\'A premium product\\' Fans cheer as Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi waits for a corner kick during the second half of an MLS soccer match against Los Angeles FC Sept. 3, 2023, in Los Angeles.

Apple did not respond to Yahoo Finance\\'s request for comment on a bid.\\n\\nManhattan Venture\\'s Rao called a possible F1 acquisition a \"net additive\" for the tech giant as \"sports is the best real-time programming that anybody can have.\"\\n\\n\"The F1 audience is big. The target audience has a good profile, and it can bring in new people to give another layer of stickiness in the Apple ecosystem,\" the analyst said, adding F1 operates as a more \"exclusive\" sport that likely attracts a higher-income consumer.\\n\\n\"Apple has a premium product.

Never miss another market-moving alert.\\n\\nNetflix smashes Q3 expectations, raises prices\\n\\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares catapulted higher on Thursday after it reported far better Q3 earnings than anticipated and a healthy rise in subscribers, while also announcing it will hike prices on its streaming services.\\n\\nThe company\\'s earnings of $3.73 per share was well above the $3.49 average analyst target, while $8.54 billion in sales was in line, and paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter - well above expectations for just over 6M.\\n\\nThe company acknowledged the \"challenging\" macro environment for the industry in the past six months due to the writers and actors strikes, and said it is \"committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible.\"\\n\\nNetflix said it sees Q4 EPS of $2.15, reversing from the prior year\\'s loss of $0.47, and anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of around 11% to some $8.69B.\\n\\nKeyBanc, Morgan Stanley, Truist and DZ Bank all upgraded the stock to buy-equivalent ratings on the news, with KeyBanc citing the company\\'s ongoing success in paid sharing, its rising operating profit and free cash flow, and its estimate that share buybacks \"should support a 25%+ EPS growth profile.\"\\n\\nMorgan Stanley, for its part, said, “We believe Netflix will deliver the objectives it set out a year ago, accelerate revenue growth back to double digits and expand margins. At the same time, some of the froth in the stock and expectations have come out, creating a better entry point.\"\\n\\nAnd JPMorgan also hailed the company\\'s paid sharing strategy, as well as a \"strong content slate\" and Q4\\'s \"favorable seasonality.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNetflix also said it will immediately raise rates on its basic and premium (non-ad-supported) plans in the US, UK and France. In the US, this will mean a $2 raise to $11.99 per month for basic, and a $3 hike to $22.99 for premium. It is keeping prices steady on ad-supported plans.\\n\\nNetflix ended the week at $400.96, up 16% for the week and some 36% higher year to date\\n\\nNvidia dented by new US restrictions on chip exports to China\\n\\nOn the flip side, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares slumped nearly 10% this past week amid the US government\\'s decision to restrict export of advanced chips to China.\\n\\nIn a regulatory filing, Nvidia highlighted the possibility of export controls affecting its ability to complete product development in a timely manner. The company also said that these controls could potentially disrupt support for existing customers of affected products and their supply to regions impacted by these restrictions.\\n\\nWhile these challenges are not expected to have an immediate financial impact, Nvidia may possibly need to relocate certain operations from one or more countries.\\n\\nAnalysts at Citi and Morgan Stanley lowered their Nvidia price targets in response.\\n\\nCiti analysts kept their Buy rating on the stock but slashed the price target by $55 to $575, writing that they \"assume low likelihood of US government granting export licenses,\" and adding that they believe the new restrictions \"will make it difficult for NVIDIA to sell to China.\"\\n\\nThey nevertheless remain bullish on Nvidia stock due to “secular AI growth which remains in early innings, in our view.”\\n\\nMorgan Stanley likewise kept Nvidia\\'s Overweight rating in place - as well as the stock\\'s designation as a \"Top Pick in semis\" - but cut the price target by $30 to $600 as the announced export controls turned out “more draconian than our expectations.”\\n\\nTesla poor earnings, caution\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tesla\\'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Q3 missed Wall Street estimates as its recent wave of electric vehicle (EV) price cuts weighed on margins, triggering a more-than-9% plunge in the shares Thursday.\\n\\nTesla reported adjusted EPS of $0.66 on revenue of $23.35B late Wednesday, making for its widest revenue miss in over three years. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.73 on revenue of $24.32B.\\n\\nGross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the quarter from 18.7% in Q2.\\n\\nShares on Thursday reversed Wednesday\\'s after-hours gains after cautious commentary by CEO Elon Musk, who appeared to waver in his optimism after once calling Tesla \"recession-resilient.\"\\n\\n“I’m worried about the high interest rate environment we’re in,” he said on the call. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car.”\\n\\nMusk also said he wants to \"temper expectations\" for Tesla\\'s Cybertruck vehicle, adding, \"It’s a great product, but financially, it will take a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cashflow contributor.\"\\n\\nTen Wall Street analysts have slashed their price targets on the stock amid increased concern about Tesla\\'s near-term outlook and its ability to maintain its exceptional expansion.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs analysts, who lowered Tesla\\'s price target by $30 to $235, wrote that they believe the Q3 report \"will add to near-to-intermediate term investor concerns.\" And Citi analysts - who cut the price target by $16 to $255, along with their full-year EPS estimate on Tesla - said the Q3 results were worse than they had anticipated.\\n\\nFor the week, shares were off about 16% to Friday\\'s close of $211.99.

In fact, according to Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), “battery costs should halve this decade, from $151 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2022 to between $60 and $90 per kWh, making EVs ‘for the first time as cheap to buy as petrol cars in every market by 2030 as well as cheaper to run.’”\\n\\nAs I’ve said before, if the world really wants to fuel further EV adoption, it needs to get aggressive with EV charging infrastructure. Right now, that severe shortage of EV charging stations will only continue to limit EV sales. However, once the issue is resolved, EV sales could easily accelerate, especially with nearly half of Americans interested in an EV.\\n\\nThat being said, investors may want to jump into EV stocks, such as:\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nEV Stocks: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\\n\\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe industry’s 800 lb. gorilla, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), is currently consolidating around $212 a share. From here, I’d like to see it retest resistance around $300 again, with patience.\\n\\nI admit, earnings were pitiful, but don’t write it off just yet. With the EV boom only set to accelerate, Tesla will eventually be a standout winner again. Unfortunately, EPS of 66 cents missed expectations of 73 cents. Revenue of $23.35 billion was also below estimates of $24.1 billion. This is also the first time TSLA missed on earnings and revenue since 2019, according to CNBC.\\n\\nWith regards to its Cybertruck, “CEO Elon Musk tempered financial expectations for the vehicle, saying, ‘It is going to require immense work to reach volume production and be cashflow positive at a price that people can afford. I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It’s a great product, but financially, it will take a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cashflow contributor.'”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBYD Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\\n\\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOr, take a look at BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF).\\n\\nDoing far better than Tesla, BYD Co.\\xa0just said quarterly profits could double on record sales. In fact, it now expects to post a third-quarter profit of “CNY9.55 billion ($1.31 billion) to CNY11.55 billion, up from CNY5.72 billion a year earlier.” That follows news the company’s EV sales were up 67% to 431,603 units in the third quarter. It also puts BYD one step closer to overtaking Tesla, whose sales fell to 435,059 from 466,140 year over year, according to Morningstar.\\n\\nEven better, Bernstein analysts also initiated coverage of BYD with an outperform rating. They believe BYD will be one of the top EV automakers in the world. Technically, after running from about $24 to a high of $36, BYD Co. has seen some recent profit taking. However, with strong sales growth, I believe it could retest $36 again soon. Longer-term, I’d like to see it retest $42.\\n\\nEV Stocks: Li Auto (LI) A front view of the Li Xiang One SUV from Li Auto.\\n\\nSource: Carrie Fereday / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is another hot EV to consider, with blistering delivery numbers. In August, company sales were up about 664% year over year to 34,914. In September, deliveries were up about 213% year over year to 36,060. That also pushed its third-quarter deliveries to 105,108, or 296.3% growth year over year. Moreover, Citi analysts recently raised their price target on LI to $65 from $54.30 a share, with a buy rating. Bank of America also raised its price target to $60 from $56.\\n\\nMoving forward, the company says it will reach or surpass the 40,000 per month mark by the fourth quarter. Plus, as noted on its latest earnings call, “Another important point to note is we’re very confident that we will be able to challenge the leadership position of Mercedes (OTCMKTS:MBGYY), BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), and Audi in China, meaning that we’ll exceed their sales in China and become the top-selling luxury brand in China,” as noted by Insider Monkey.\\n\\nAfter exploding from about $17 to $47.50, Li Auto is seeing some profit taking. However, if the company can maintain its year-over-year delivery growth, it could again revisit resistance at $47.50 shortly.\\n\\nXPeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\\n\\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThere’s also XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), which just delivered a record 15,310 Smart EVs in September. Those numbers were up 12% month over month and 81% year over year. In August, it delivered 13,690 of them, an increase of 24% month over month and 43% year over year. In addition, total Smart EV deliveries for the third quarter jumped to 40,008, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 72%.\\n\\nHelping, as I noted earlier this month, “Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) invested $700 million into XPEV to help boost sales. Reportedly, the two companies will develop two mid-sized VW-branded EVs for the Chinese market, with plans to roll them out by 2026.” Better, the company has plans to aggressively expand into Europe, including Germany, Britain, and France, in the new year. And according to Bank of America analysts, the company could turn a profit in 2025, as compared to a net loss in the firm’s prior forecast. All thanks to its recent deal with Volkswagen.\\n\\nXPEV last traded at $14.25 a share. From here, I’d like to see it retest resistance around $19 again soon.\\n\\nEV Stocks: Krane Shares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility ETF (KARS) Two electric vehicles facing a dark sky, sunset background with one EV hooked up to an EV charger in between the two cars\\n\\nSource: shutterstock.com/Larich\\n\\nAnother smart way to invest in electric vehicles is with an ETF, such as the Krane Shares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility ETF (NYSEARCA:KARS).

Some of its top holdings include Tesla, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY), Li Auto, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), and BYD Co., to name a few of the top ones.\\n\\nAt the moment, KARS is oversold at $26.87. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.

The ETF appears to have caught strong support after dropping from about $27.67 to $22.90. From here, I’d like to see it retest $27.67 again.\\n\\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF(LIT) Lithium element on the periodic table. Undervalued Lithium Stocks\\n\\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock\\n\\nThere’s also the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT), which should benefit from heavy demand for lithium. After all, without lithium, we can’t build EVs or have the green future that countries are demanding.\\n\\nWith an expense ratio of 0.75%, the LIT ETF invests in the full lithium cycle, from mining and refining the metal through battery production. Some of its top holdings include Albemarle, Panasonic, BYD Co., Tesla, Livent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM), Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL), and Standard Lithium (NYSEMKT:SLI).\\n\\nCurrently, the LIT ETF is also considerably oversold at $52.09.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can directly go to Top 5 Brands Among Gen Z in the US by Mindshare.\\n\\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, Generation Z is the second youngest generation in the world. The generation is called the \"Digital Natives\" meaning this generation grew up with easy access to the internet. Generation Z is of utmost importance to companies, due to their knowledge of technology and growing population. By 2025, the generation is expected to make up a quarter of the Asia Pacific, a huge market for companies to target.\\n\\nThe report also shares some unique characteristics of the generation, indicating how they may impact buying behavior. For instance, the generation spends most of their time terminally online, shopping, working, or making friends. Additionally, the generation makes up 60% of the users on TikTok, meaning that social media is an important part of the generation\\'s daily routine. Such could be a possible explanation for the rise in social and e-commerce platforms across the globe.\\n\\nWhat Do Teens in The US Think About Brands?\\n\\nPiper Sandler conducted its 46th semi-annual fall Generation Z survey with 9,193 teens as survey respondents across the United States, with an average age of 15.7. The survey was conducted between September 4 and September 27.\\n\\nAccording to the survey, 37% of the surveyed teens were currently employed as part-time workers and reported their spending to go down by 1% to $2,316 during the fall. Such happens to be the first decrease ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, with inflation standing as the second biggest concern for 9% of the pool. Other important social causes that concerned the group of teens surveyed included racial inequality, the environment, abortion, and the economy, which may be useful information for marketers.\\n\\nAccording to the report, food expense was the number one wallet priority, and male spending reported an increase of 11%. Female fashion spending decreased by 7% and cosmetics held the greatest proportion of beauty spending.

Some of the most popular brands from the report by Piper Sandler include NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\\n\\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a leading footwear and sports apparel company based in the United States. On September 28, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $0.94, beating market consensus by $0.18. Additionally, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) posted a revenue of $12.94 billion during the quarter, with a year-on-year revenue growth of 1.99%.\\n\\nOn October 17, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed its new Apple Pencil. The new Apple Pencil reports having pixel-perfect accuracy, low latency, and tilt sensitivity. The pencil is a great tool for note-taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and designing.

The Apple Pencil works with all models of the iPad having a USB-C port.\\n\\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is on the radar of investors and analysts.

The stock has an average price forecast of $175.38 and a high price target of $230.\\n\\nThe buying behavior among teens is highly dynamic and a cause of concern for business owners. Such highlights the need to constantly invest time and resources trying to understand and analyze Generation Z\\'s buying behavior. With that, let\\'s take a look at the top 20 brands among Gen Z in the US by mindshare. You can also check out Gen Z\\'s favorite brands in 2023.\\n\\nTop 20 Brands Among Gen Z in the US by Mindshare\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nFor our title, top 20 brands among Gen Z in the US by mindshare, we sourced our data from Piper Sandler\\'s 46th semi-annual fall Generation Z survey. The survey was conducted between September 4 and September 27, with a sample of 9,193 teens across the United States. The teens comprised 54% males, 45% females, and 1% non-binary. Additionally, the survey spread out to the South, West, Midwest, and Northeast regions, consisting of 21%, 36%, 29%, and 14% of the teens respectively. The average age of the teens was posted at 15.7.\\n\\nThe brands were categorized by sectors and ranked by mindshare. By definition, mindshare is defined as the amount or level of consumer awareness about a product, brand, company, or idea. In the report, we noticed that in some instances the percentage of ownership for a brand among the survey respondents was displayed. Ownership is a reflection of the mindshare, meaning that popular brands are most likely to be owned by consumers and vice versa. Additionally, some cases were ranked under more than one sector. To counter such, we took the average of the mindshare or ownership percentage. Such cases have been mentioned and highlighted distinctly.\\n\\nTop 20 Brands Among Gen Z in the US by Mindshare\\n\\n20.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amgen Inc. (AMGN) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\\r\\n\\r\\nApple shares have outperformed the broader market this year (+34% vs. +12.8% for the S&P 500 index) and roughly matched the Zacks Tech sector (+34% vs. +34.8%). The company expects iPhone and Services’ year-over-year growth to accelerate in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the June quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple launched four new iPhone models at its product launch event on Sep 12. Demand for the high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max is strong as shipment delivery has reportedly slipped to mid-November. It also upgraded Airpods and made iOS 17, watchOS 10, iPadOS 17 and tvOS 17 available.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and robust adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Arcade are helping drive subscriber growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline double digits on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter due to difficult comparisons.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nShares of Amgen have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9.7% vs. -20.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recently completed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is expected to enhance Amgen’s growth prospects. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen’s products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimate movements have been mixed ahead of Q3 results.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nShares of Becton, Dickinson have gained +2.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry’s gain of +12.2%. The company continued focus on research and development (R&D) and its progress toward meeting its BD 2025 strategy raises optimism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company’s divestiture of its surgical instruments platform to support the achievement of its BD 2025 financial goals and further advance the BD Interventional segment’s focus on high-growth end markets looks promising.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegulatory approvals and product launches over the past few months are also encouraging. Yet, BD’s operation in a significantly consolidated and competitive medical technology industry is worrying. Lower COVID-only testing revenues are discouraging from a business perspective. Forex volatility prevails.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Becton, Dickinson here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UnitedHealth Group (UNH), MPLX LP (MPLX) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK).\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector of Research\\r\\n\\r\\nSheraz Mian\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

If you want to skip our introduction to the consumer staples sector, then check out 5 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\nThe stock market is made of thousands of stocks that belong to firms operating in different industries and sectors. Broadly speaking, companies can be segregated into two categories. One of these is the business to business segment, which caters to firms that sell their goods and services only to other firms or large entities. The second segment is the consumer facing segment, made of companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) which sell products and services to private individuals.\\n\\nThe second segment can further be divided into two categories depending on the nature of their products. Apple is a consumer discretionary firm, which means that its sales depend on the income and money that customers have at their disposal for non essential spending. After all, not buying an iPhone in 2023 is unlikely to cause anyone to lose weight due to a lack of nutrition. The second category within the second segment is consumer staples companies. These lie on the opposite end of the spectrum of discretionary firms as they are made up of companies whose products are essential for daily living. A great example of a consumer staples, or consumer defensive, firm is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), since buying groceries is necessary to live healthily.\\n\\nNaturally, the difference between the business models of consumer defensive and consumer discretionary firms also tailors their shares to the economic and stock market environment. As was the case throughout 2022, when inflation is rising and purchasing power and disposable incomes are dropping, consumer discretionary stocks rapidly lose value on the stock market. However, when the economy is growing, the trend is reversed and these stocks are often among the first to appreciate as investor expectations about the future state of the economy are reflected in the share price. For some such stocks, check out 15 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs you might have guessed, consumer staples stocks are the opposite. During a market and economic downturn, their shares do not lose as much as their discretionary peers since people continue to spend on essentials even if their income is dropping. Naturally, this 'defensive' aspect of the shares also means that their growth lags the discretionary stocks in an economic upswing since no one would really buy five tubes of toothpaste instead of one even if the economy is growing in the double digits.\\n\\nSince the fate of consumer staples stocks is tied to the economy, a brief look at the current economic state of the United States is necessary. U.S. stock markets roared during the first half of this year as an AI fueled hype wave and a robust economy muted fears about a downturn. Consequently, while Apple's shares are up by 38% year to date, Walmart's shares have posted more modest 11.88% in gains. However, the future might be different if we look at the current doom and gloom that has returned to investors' minds once again during the tail end of a year.\\n\\nOver the past month, the S&P500 index is down by 5.45% while the NASDAQ 100, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) have shed 5.10%, 5.97 and 4.46%, respectively. This makes it clear the market is uncertain about the future, particularly about the number of interest rate cuts that might take place in 2024. Additionally, the longer the rates are higher, the greater their impact is on economic growth, which is then tied to the fate of consumer staples stocks.\\n\\nLooking at these details, one would imagine that consumer staples stocks might be worth looking at. We took a look at some today, and the top picks are The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).\\n\\nPhoto by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo compile our list of the best consumer staples stocks, we first made a list of the 20 largest consumer staples companies in terms of their market capitalization.

Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal reports on the possibility of more streamers moving toward theatrical releases and the financial benefits of this route.\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nSEANA SMITH: It\\'s the latest of what we\\'re going to see from the box office this weekend because the box office is hoping for another big hit this weekend with the highly anticipated Martin Scorsese film, \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" Now, after the success of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" over the summer, Tim Cook and Apple, well, they\\'re aiming for their own box office glory. Let\\'s bring in Yahoo Finance\\'s Alexandra Canal who is following the latest on this. And Ali, what can we expect?\\n\\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, a big box office weekend hopefully for Apple. Remember, the tech giant reportedly committed to invest $1 billion into theatrical films and now we\\'re starting to see those investments begin to play out. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" will not be the only Apple production that we\\'ll see in theaters this year.\\n\\nWe also have \"Napoleon\" and \"Argylle\" hitting the box office later this fall. Those films will have exclusive theatrical windows for about 45 days before dropping on Apple TV Plus. And of course, this all follows the Oscar-winning film CODA which really set up Apple\\'s film division for success.\\n\\nAnd it seems like more and more recently, Apple CEO Tim Cook has been on board with this production ride. He has been showing up to special screenings. He\\'s been to Cannes. So he really seems to have thrown his support behind these films.\\n\\nClearly, the monetary commitment is there as well with those three films that I mentioned debuting this year will have budgets of $200 million before those marketing expenses. So in this age where we\\'ve seen various experimentation within the box office and within streaming exclusives, Apple clearly seems to be siding with the theatrical, whereas competitors like Netflix, for example, really leaning into the streaming side of things. I\\'m not sure how much longer that can continue since it\\'s pretty much been proven at this point that the returns from those box office releases are much more substantial and significant than those streaming returns.\\n\\nAnd then, of course, you have in the background the ongoing actor strike and what the impact could potentially be there. So another story that we\\'re watching very closely. But interesting to see Apple, the tech giant, leaning in to the film and the creative side right now.\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: All right, Yahoo Finance\\'s own Ali Canal there breaking down what I need to go watch this weekend perhaps.

This is especially true as these have driven nearly all of the S&P 500’s 12% year-to-date gains because of their outsized weighting in the index. However, the seven stocks have stumbled in the third quarter as a surge in yields threatens to dull the allure of equities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\\xa0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Tesla came up with dismal results, pushing shares down by more than 9%. (read: Tesla Posts Weak Q3 Earnings: ETFs in Focus).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the remaining companies, some are expected to report next week and others thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the big seven companies are a big contributor to S&P earnings. Third-quarter earnings of this group of companies are expected to grow 34.9% from the same period last year on 11.2% higher revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are expected to release results on Oct 24 after market close, while Meta Platforms is expected to report on Oct 25. Amazon will report on Oct 26 and Apple on Nov 2.\\xa0 Nvidia is expected to come up with earnings on Nov 15 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\\n\\nMicrosoft\\n\\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings track is impressive, with the four-quarter earnings surprise being 5.27%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 12.8% and modest revenue growth of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 44%) and has shed 2.3% over the past three months. It has a solid Growth Score of B.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAlphabet\\n\\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter.

Alphabet has a solid Growth Score of A and falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 37%). The Internet behemoth has climbed 6.7% in the last three months.\\n\\nMeta Platforms\\n\\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +3.98% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates massive year-over-year earnings growth of 117.7%. Revenues are also expected to increase 20.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 18.99%, on average, in the last four quarters.

The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates whopping year-over-year earnings growth of 190% and substantial revenue growth of 11.4% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon’s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 40.96%. The stock has a solid Growth Score of A but falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 37%).\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal fourth quarter. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprise. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.6815% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 7.7% for earnings and a decrease of 1.3% for revenues. Apple belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 21%) and has a solid Growth Score of B.\\n\\nNvidia\\n\\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93% and a Zacks Rank #1. This videogame-gear specialist saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past 30 days for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Nvidia’s earnings surprise history is good as it delivered an earnings surprise of 9.79%, on average, in the last four quarters.

That helps explain why mutual funds continue to grow in popularity. Today, more than half (52%) of Americans are invested in mutual funds, up from less than 6% of people in 1980. Generally speaking, mutual funds provide investors with broad exposure to a basket of stocks selected by a professional and actively managed. Because of the actively managed nature of mutual funds, they tend to charge higher fees than more passively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\\n\\nWhile some investors and analysts grumble about the high fees charged by mutual funds, there are many funds that offer low fees and expert stock picking. Sourcing these types of mutual funds is advantageous and can help investors save for a comfortable future. Here are three mutual funds to invest in for pro-management and low fees.\\n\\nVanguard Information Technology Index Fund Admiral Shares (VITAX) Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market Returns. Tech Stocks to buy\\n\\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhen it comes to mutual funds, Vanguard offers the lowest fees around. The company’s flagship technology-focused fund, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQ:VITAX) charges a management fee of only 0.10%, which is rock bottom for the industry. For that fee, investors get a fund that holds 319 stocks, including prominent tech names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) — to name a few.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThis fund, focused entirely on companies in the electronics and computing industries, has a strong track record of growth. So far in 2023, the VITAX mutual fund is up 33% as many of its tech holdings have seen their share prices surge with the market rebound from 2022’s downturn. The nice thing about this actively managed tech fund is it also pays a regular dividend to investors. Currently, Vanguard’s VITAX fund pays a quarterly distribution of 44 cents per share.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSchwab Core Equity Fund (SWANX)\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nFor more diversity, there is the Schwab Core Equity Fund (NASDAQ:SWANX) from investment giant Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). The fund also contains many tech stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, its portfolio also includes energy companies such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), healthcare companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and even Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B).\\n\\nIn addition to its diversity, the SWANX fund is also more targeted, holding a total of 52 stocks. The expense ratio is higher at 0.73% but still reasonable for a mutual fund of its size. And it pays an annual dividend of $2.79 per unit held, giving it a yield of 1.26%. In terms of performance, the fund has returned 12% to investors so far in 2023. This fund is a good bet for investors wanting a targeted and diverse group of leading U.S. large-cap stocks.\\n\\nVanguard European Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VEUSX) A sign with European countries on it\\n\\nSource: Shutterstock\\n\\nInvestors wanting exposure to foreign stocks should consider the Vanguard European Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQ:VEUSX). This is a mutual fund offering broad exposure to the European market. It’s a big fund that holds more than 1,300 stocks that span the entire European region and all economic sectors. As with all Vanguard funds, the VEUSX mutual fund has a low management expense ratio of just 0.13%. However, note that the fund requires a minimum investment of $3,000.\\n\\nSome of the major holdings in VEUSX include sizable European concerns such as food giant Nestle SA (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), drug maker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and energy company Shell (NYSE:SHEL). Nearly 100% of the stocks in the fund are based on the European continent. Over the past year, the VEUSX fund has increased nearly 20%. Like nearly all Vanguard funds, this one pays a quarterly dividend of 32 cents. This investment is a great option for investors who want broad exposure to foreign markets.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT.

He\\'s famous for his commitment to high-value stocks and holding for the long term.\\n\\nTo this point, Buffet once said \"Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices\".\\n\\nAmong Berkshire Hathaway\\'s (NYSE:BRK) holdings, two giants stand out: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). These two iconic companies have not only provided Berkshire Hathaway with significant capital appreciation but are a substantial source of annual dividend income, contributing just north of $1.6 billion to Berkshire Hathaway’s coffers every year.\\n\\nApple Inc: A Fruitful Investment\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s investment in Apple is a testament to Buffett’s knack for recognizing enduring value. In 2016, Berkshire Hathaway initiated a stake in Apple, and it has since become one of the conglomerate’s largest holdings.\\n\\nAnd it’s not as if it was cheap. Berkshire dumped $36 Billion into its Apple investments over the years, but that has certainly paid off. The company’s stake is worth more than $162 Billion today.\\n\\nPeople know Apple for its forward thinking products, but it’s also a dividend-paying company. The technology giant has a history of rewarding its shareholders with consistent dividend payments. Berkshire Hathaway’s substantial ownership stake in Apple translates into just shy of $900 million a year in dividends.\\n\\nCoca-Cola: The Classic Dividend Dynamo\\n\\nCoca-Cola is another cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment portfolio. The beverage giant has a tradition of paying strong dividends. Buffett held a substantial position in Coca-Cola for years, which has contributed significantly to its annual dividend income. The steady cash flow from Coca-Cola’s dividends adds stability to Berkshire Hathaway’s investment portfolio.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nToday, Berkshire\\'s 400 million shares are worth more than $21 Billion and provide $736 million in dividends.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThese two investments, combined with 3 other dividend powerhouses – Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) – provide a whopping $4.31 billion a year in dividends for Berkshire Hathaway. It\\'s clear that dividends can and should be a significant portion of any investment portfolio.\\n\\nHowever, not all dividend stocks are created equal and choosing the right one is a daunting task for many retail investors. One option is to invest in a dividend-focused fund like Innovative Portfolios\\' Dividend Performers ETF (BATS:IPDP). By choosing to go with an ETF, investors leave the challenging analysis and market research to fund managers and their teams of experts.\\n\\nDon\\'t miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you want to skip our introduction to mid-cap stocks and the stock market, then take a look at Top Investors' Stock Portfolio: 5 Mid-Cap Stocks To Buy.\\n\\nMid-cap stocks are typically large companies that have a market capitalization ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion. These firms are often sizeable entities with formidable balance sheets and often a global presence that enables them to diversify their revenue stream to remove region specific risks from their revenue and profit. The nature of their business model and their market capitalization range often makes mid-cap stocks quite lucrative from an investment perspective due to several advantages.\\n\\nFor instance, the well established business models and strong balance sheet proved to be a great asset for mid-cap companies during economic turmoil. This is because when an economy slows down, consumer and corporate spending power drops and feeds into each other as lower consumer spending depresses company revenues and low revenues mean either salary cuts or layoffs. In such a scenario, the larger the firm's customer base and market penetration is, the more stability it can hope to achieve as the large market means money continues to flow into its coffers even if it drops on an annual or a sequential basis.\\n\\nAnother benefit of investing in mid-cap stocks is their market value and share price. As opposed to mega cap giants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) whose large value and expensive shares often prevent significant share price appreciation, the relatively lower prices for the mid-cap companies can often provide good returns provided the right catalysts are in place. At the same time, while small cap or micro cap stocks can also see market scams in the form of pump and dump schemes, the shares of mid-cap companies are also relatively insulated against this phenomenon since the share price is for the most part higher than the small cap stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThis enables mid-cap stocks to offer a balance between growth and stability which makes them quite suitable for investment purposes. Additionally, investing comes in all flavors, and one such flavor is dividends which is one of the lesser talked about benefits of investing in mid-cap stocks. Not all companies can afford to pay dividends, and the decision involves several factors. Dividends are paid out from after tax income, and should a firm decide not to pay them, then it typically reinvests the money for growth. Therefore, the decision to pay dividends is influenced by two factors, namely, a company's ability to generate significant net income to pay the dividends and the nature of its industry growth requirements.\\n\\nSo how do dividends and mid-cap stocks fit with each other? Well, one way in which investors evaluate dividend stocks is by calculating their yield. A stock's dividend yield is its dividend payout divided by the share price, and a higher yield means more bang for the buck in the form of dividend payouts. This area, the yield, is where mid-cap stocks shine as their relatively lower share prices compared to mega cap stocks often means that they are able to provide dividend investors with a higher yield.\\n\\nAs an illustration of this principle, consider the dividend yields of the top three companies with the highest dividend yields in our coverage of the 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy. These companies are Bank OZK (NASDAQ:OZK), UGI Corporation (NYSE:UGI), and National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE:NFG), which had dividend yields of 4.2%, 4.1%, and 3.3% as of April 2023. For comparison, two of the largest mega cap tech stocks, namely Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:AAPL) have dividend yields of 0.54% and 0.92%, respectively, so it's clear that the top mid-cap stocks naturally offer a greater 'bang for the buck' when it comes to dividends. Additionally, if dividends are not your thing but you'd like to see which mid-cap stocks are the most profitable, we also took a look at some such companies during our 12 Most Profitable Mid-Cap Stocks Now coverage. In this list, the top three firms are Liberty Global plc (NASDAQ:LBTYA), Jackson Financial Inc. (NYSE:JXN), and Federal National Mortgage Association (OTC:FNMA).\\n\\nFinally, if you're wondering about the outlook for mid-cap stocks, here's what Brown Advisory had to say about them in its MID-CAP GROWTH REVIEW AND OUTLOOK letter for the second quarter of 2023:\\n\\nThe strategy outpaced its benchmark, the Russell Midcap ® Growth Index, during the second quarter. Its largest contributors were generally growth-oriented companies (such as CoStar Group, Chipotle, and Trade Desk) that continue to post strong fundamental results, or technology companies exposed to the generative AI theme (such as Marvell). Despite the win in the quarter, the strategy mildly lagged its benchmark for the first half of the year, mostly due to cash drag in an energetic market, a couple conservative holdings (Bio-Rad and Dollar General) underperforming our fundamental expectations, and our underweight to momentum-oriented investments, which is typical given our approach.\\n\\nIn general, the market environment of the first quarter continued through the second quarter of 2023. Growth and momentum-oriented investments that struggled last year rebounded further through June despite the yield on the 10- year U.S. Treasury climbing 32 basis points (bps) as banking-crisis and recession fears ebbed. During the last three months, growth generally beat value while large-cap benchmarks mostly outpaced their small-cap counterparts, primarily driven by mega-cap tech (MSFT and AAPL each gained 18% in the second quarter, for instance).\\n\\nSo, which mid-cap stocks are worth it for a top investment portfolio? The top three on our list are IQVIA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:IQV), Arista Networks, Inc.

They generate significant premiums, which management uses as “float” to invest in companies with long-term potential. Key examples include investments in Coca-Cola in the early 1990s, BNSF in 2010, and Apple in recent years.\\n\\nAs of the end of Q2 2023, Berkshire had $147 billion in cash.

Also, it’s expanding internationally to tap into emerging markets like India and to solidify its global dominance.\\n\\nDue to its innovative culture, the retail giant has always been a pioneer in new markets.

In fact, a grand total of just nine companies have reached this figure to-date. And some of them, like Petrochina (OTCMKTS:PCCYF), only briefly hit the mark before seeing their valuations decline.\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) became the Nasdaq-listed company to hit the trillion-dollar threshold in Aug. 2018. It was quickly followed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a variety of the other leading tech giants.\\n\\nGiven that there have only been nine trillion-dollar companies to-date, it is no guarantee that we’ll see all that many more trillion-dollar firms in the near future. However, here are seven of the leading contenders to join this exclusive club in coming years.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is Warren Buffett’s famed conglomerate hailing from Omaha, Nebraska.\\n\\nAt a market cap of $750 billion today, it should be only a matter of time until Berkshire Hathaway reaches the $1 trillion threshold. Recently, Berkshire Hathaway’s valuation has grown dramatically due to its shrewd bet on shares of Apple.\\n\\nHowever, investors shouldn’t lose sight of Berkshire’s portfolio of underlying businesses as well. I believe there is a great deal of value in Berkshire operations such as its railroad and insurance holdings.\\n\\nWarren Buffett is now 93 years old. While he remains in good health, there will eventually be a changing of the guard at the company. It is quite possible that Berkshire will start paying a dividend, spinning off assets, or otherwise reshaping its portfolio in coming years, which could unlock a good deal of latent shareholder value.\\n\\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\\n\\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThanks to its world-spanning credit card business,\\xa0Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the world’s largest financial companies today.\\n\\nAnd it’s a good bet to think it will get a lot larger going forward. Visa has grown revenues at an 11% annualized compounded rate over the past decade, and free cash flow has surged 15% per year over that same period.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nVisa benefits from a number of structural long-term tailwinds. First is the rise of electronic payments. Credit cards are still taking significant share from cash, especially in emerging markets. On top of that, the rise of the global middle class is creating hundreds of millions of shoppers with access to credit cards for the first time. And as a business that takes a percentage transaction fee, inflation and rising average transaction size naturally increase Visa’s bottom line as well.\\n\\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\\n\\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhile we’re at it, let’s throw\\xa0Mastercard (NYSE:MA) in here as well. At a roughly $375 billion market cap today, Mastercard starts out a fair bit behind Visa ($490 billion) in the race to joining the\\xa0 trillion-dollar companies list.\\n\\nThat said, the two combined firms would be worth nearly a trillion dollars already and there’s good reason to think both of the credit card titans will eventually reach that threshold individually.\\n\\nThe reason why isn’t too hard to work out. As Morningstar’s Brett Horn put it: “[D]espite the evolution in the payment space, we think a wide moat surrounds the business and view Mastercard’s position in the current global electronic payment infrastructure as essentially unassailable.” When aiming for companies that can grow for the long-term, it generally makes sense to buy companies whose market position is nearly impossible to disrupt.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\\n\\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s dominant semiconductor foundry; it has surpassed 50% total market share in recent years.\\n\\nThis makes the case for putting TSM among the potential trillion-dollar companies a very simple one. There will be a lot more chip sales in five or ten years than there are today. The explosion of new applications such as artificial intelligence and edge computing ensures that the overall market will continue to grow. And TSM is set to reap the rewards of that larger market thanks to its unmatched scale and technological prowess.\\n\\nCould anything disrupt TSM’s inexorable climb? Geopolitics are a major concern, and understandably so. However, TSM is investing heavily in manufacturing capabilities outside of Taiwan – such as in Arizona – to make the firm more resilient. At this point, frankly, the electronics industry is so reliant on TSM that it is hard to imagine supply chains functioning without TSM being there as a focal point.\\n\\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\\n\\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAt first glance, it might seem odd to put\\xa0Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) on a list of future trillion-dollar companies. After all, isn’t oil obsolete and the industry heading on a path of slow decline? It certainly may have looked that way prior to recent years.\\n\\nBut then geopolitics happened. Between the war in Ukraine, violence in the Middle East, and rising concerns about the state of U.S.-Chinese relations, there is a lot going on. Meanwhile, the oil market has limited excess supply – a fact that shouldn’t be too surprising given the underinvestment in the industry over the past decade. With so much focus on renewables and decarbonization, less money has gone into finding new economic oil and gas deposits.\\n\\nThat said, Exxon Mobil has bucked that trend. It kept investing through the down years and that has paid off in a major way with large new fields coming online in places such as Guyana.\\n\\nExxon’s increased production will prove invaluable. Global experts forecast that oil demand will continue to climb until around 2030 and then plateau from there. This gives oil companies time for at least one more big bull run before the industry starts to move toward managed decline.\\n\\nWith Exxon remaining focused on oil and gas and having large profitable investments in the works, it has a good chance of ultimately reaching the $1 trillion market cap threshold later this decade. That’s especially true if oil prices cruise past $100/barrel.\\n\\nWalmart (WMT)\\n\\nSource: BCFC / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) was once a glamorous high-flying stock. In the late 1990s, shares traded above 40 times earnings and many momentum investors prized their WMT stock holdings.\\n\\nThe last 20 years have been much less kind to Walmart. The firm was slow to get a handle on e-commerce. Walmart’s reputation took a hit due to some scandals and negative media reports. And investors worried that Walmart had already become a mature company with few remaining growth opportunities.\\n\\nHowever, Walmart has turned things around. The pandemic gave Walmart a chance to exceed customers’ expectations during those trying times, and Walmart has put together a much more robust omnichannel approach. That, in combination with its prowess in maintaining low costs and lean operations has put Walmart in great position to deal with the current inflationary marketplace.\\n\\nAn under-appreciated offering from Walmart is its international operations spanning two dozen countries. I’m particularly excited about Walmart de Mexico (OTCMKTS:WMMVY), the firm’s Mexican and Central American store operator. Walmart de Mexico is that country’s largest retailer and has enjoyed massive growth over the past 20 years as the Mexican economy flourishes. Walmart (the corporate parent) retains 70% ownership in Walmart de Mexico, allowing WMT stock owners to cash in on the Mexican economic boom. It might just reach trillion-dollar companies status yet.\\n\\nDanaher (DHR) Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.\\n\\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock\\n\\nAt an approximately $160 billion market cap today,\\xa0Danaher (NYSE:DHR) has the most work to do to reach the trillion-dollar companies status.\\n\\nHowever, don’t count out Danaher. Historically, it has been an absolute growth machine. On a split-adjusted basis, Danaher shares went for around 10 cents each in 1983; they trade for more than $200/share today.\\n\\nThe company has delivered these life-changing returns through a pursuit of unceasing mergers and acquisitions. Danaher rolls up large chunks of an industry, optimizes and scales up operations, and generates best in class returns from those assets.\\n\\nRecently, Danaher has made a strategic pivot. It has sold or spun off all of its industrial and non-core businesses to become an exclusively health care-focused firm which offers leading life sciences tools and equipment. Specifically, it is a large player in bioprocessing, which is an integral step in the creation of new pharmaceutical drugs and compounds.\\n\\nAnalysts suggest that bioprocessing could grow at nearly a 15% annualized rate over the next five years. This sets the stage for the next progression in Danaher’s long-running growth machine.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DHR, WMMVY, V, XOM, and BRK-B stock.

If you want to skip our introduction to the battery industry and want to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then check out 5 Best Battery Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024.\\n\\nOne of the most important principles when it comes to investing is trying to guess which industries will play essential roles in the future. After all, if a sector becomes indispensable to customers when it comes to its products, then, naturally, sales in the sector will be strong and income will grow provided that the managers running the business (or businesses) have sound heads on their shoulders. And one doesn't have to look too hard to find examples of such sectors. For instance, one of the best examples of a sector that has grown rapidly over the course of just a couple of decades is consumer technology, and firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have become trillion dollar entities with billions of dollars in annual revenue.\\n\\nHowever, while Apple's era of rapid growth is most likely over, one budding industry that continues to attract investor attention is the electric vehicle industry. There are several reasons why EV companies are among the most popular among retail and institutional investors alike. Firstly, they offer a revolutionary new technology with the potential to upend the current status quote. Additionally, governments of most developed countries plan to phase out internal combustion cars over the next couple of decades, which naturally opens up the market for electric vehicle manufacturers and allows them to scale their operations.\\n\\nAt the heart of the electric vehicle is the battery. Akin to the fuel tank on a conventional car, without the battery, an electric vehicle cannot function. Additionally, each car has multiple batteries, which makes their demand quite voluminous. As a result, it is unsurprising that the battery industry is a sector that is pinned with some of the highest growth rates in the business world. For instance, consider the market for lithium, which is the building block of the modern day battery. Research estimates that the global lithium market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% between 2021 and 2031 to sit at an estimated $135 billion by the end of the forecast period. Concerning lithium batteries, China is projected to be the largest consumer of these products in 2030, with the Asian economic giant estimated to account for 40% of the global lithium battery demand.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe next question to ask in our analysis of the global battery market and the best battery stocks is, which countries produce the most lithium? After all, if the world really is to completely shift towards electric vehicles, then lithium can very well be the next oil, and the countries that have adequate resources or production facilities will play an indispensable role. Well, looking at the demand projections above, it is perhaps unsurprising that China had the greatest share of global lithium ion battery manufacturing capacity in 2021. We took a look at Lithium Battery Production By Country: Top 12 Countries and determined the top three countries in terms of battery manufacturing capacity (surprise, surprise) China, the U.S., and Hungary. In 2021, China accounted for a whopping 79% of global manufacturing capacity while the U.S. and Hungary accounted for 6.2% and 4%, respectively.\\n\\nHowever, while China might make the most batteries, it doesn't produce the most lithium. In fact, based purely on annual lithium production, the country that has the greatest potential to be the next Saudi Arabia is Australia. This is because Australia produced 55,000 tons of lithium in 2021, which is greater than the production of the next four countries that follow it in the list of 12 Countries That Produce The Most Lithium and naturally makes Australia the largest lithium producer in the world.\\n\\nFinally, while lithium ion batteries are the mainstay of the electric vehicle industry due to their high energy density, they are also highly toxic and can be quite dangerous in the wrong circumstance. One battery technology that can replace lithium ion batteries and provide far greater energy density and performance is solid state batteries. These batteries do not use a liquid electrolyte to conduct electricity, which improves the amount of current that travels between the negative and positive terminals. When it comes to battery technologies, if we only consider the number of patents filed, then Japan is the most advanced country in the world when it comes to battery technologies.\\n\\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top battery stocks to buy heading into 2024, and some notable names are General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON).\\n\\nPhoto by Kumpan Electric on Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo make our list of the best battery stocks to buy, we first made a list of 28 companies that supply lithium, sell batteries, or provide technologies to operate batteries. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 were picked as the top battery stocks for 2024.\\n\\nBest Battery Stocks To Buy Heading into 2024\\n\\n11. Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2023: 16\\n\\nSolid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) is an American firm that develops solid state batteries. Owing to the nascent nature of the solid state industry, it should be quite some time before the products can be adopted by the mass market, and perhaps this is why the firm's shares are rated Hold on average. However, the average share price target of $3.5 does hint at a large upside over the current share price of $1.67.\\n\\nBy the end of this year's second quarter, 16 out of the 910 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had held a stake in Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP). Out of these, the largest shareholder is Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group as it owns 1.5 million shares that are worth $3.8 million.\\n\\nSolid Power, Inc.

QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2023: 17\\n\\nQuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) is another solid state battery company that is currently in the research and development phase. This makes it a stock that is purely a long term play, as the shares can either rise if a major breakthrough takes place or continue to lose their value if QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) remains quiet.\\n\\nDuring Q2 2023, 17 hedge funds among the 910 part of Insider Monkey's database had bought and owned QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS)'s shares. Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management is the firm's largest hedge fund investor through its $24.4 million investment.\\n\\n8.

Peter S. Park's Park West Asset Management owns the biggest stake among these, which is worth $97.1 million.\\n\\n6. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.

To see more such companies, go directly to ChatGPT Stock Advice: 5 Recent Stock Recommendations.\\n\\nMore and more hedge funds are starting to deploy AI for stock picking and financial analysis. And the logic behind this practice is clear: if AI can write, solve complex mathematical problems, detect messages hidden in artwork and solve riddles, why can’t it analyze stocks and predict their movements? Some analysts were of the view that when it comes to stock picking and investing in general, AI has a lot of catching up to do because there are just too many moving parts in this domain that seem to apparently confuse AI systems. A report by Bloomberg quoted data which said that a Eurekahedge index of 12 funds using AI has trailed its broader hedge fund index by about 14 percentage points over the past five years. The report also quotes Plexus Investments, which tracks the performance of AI funds. The firm said that only 45% of its tracked funds outperform their respective benchmarks.\\n\\nBut the spectacular learning curve of AI is making it do the catching up much earlier than expected. As companies pour billions in large language models and training systems to refine AI, these programs are getting better by the second. The Bloomberg report also cited Andreas Vogel, a senior analyst at Plexus, who said:\\n\\n“Today, AI and machine learning can already compete with traditional fund managers.”\\n\\n\"AI Epiphany\"\\n\\nThe Bloomberg report also talked about Rayliant Global Advisors, founded by quant investor Jason Hsu. Hsu had an “AI epiphany” many years ago when he looked at a hypothetical investing strategy that used the power of machines to beat the market\\n\\n“It took us a while to convince ourselves. Then we finally got to a place where we said, ‘We see the value. We get the benefits.’”\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWhen you prompt ChatGPT to recommend stocks, it immediately comes up with generic statements, saying as a large language model it is not trained to recommend stocks.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top stock recommendations from ChatGPT.

However, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was slipping as of October 18 amid reports that the US government would now allow the company, among other semiconductor firms, to export chips to China. However, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) said that these restrictions would not have a meaningful impact on company finances.\\n\\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 175 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\\n\\nArtisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“Our focus on scalable business models has its roots in our economic framework. As potential output moderated in most emerging countries, it became clear to us affordability was not improving and that low penetration was necessary but not sufficient for value creation. We eliminated companies from the portfolio that were struggling to generate revenue significantly in excess of fixed costs, often replacing them with passport companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Airbnb that were economically tied to emerging markets. Over a period of time, we have been successful in redefining the emerging markets opportunity set around real per capita GDP increases, growth in the middle class, revenue velocity and demand fulfilment. Combined with changes in the market backdrop that have resulted in privileged competitive positions for companies with financial strength and access to capital, we find our opportunity set expanding anew to include companies that are both based in emerging markets and conducive to value creation.”\\n\\n14. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\\n\\nChatGPT thinks The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has long-term growth potential. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is however struggling this year amid housing market tremors and rising mortgage rates. In August The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) posted second quarter results.

(NYSE:HD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) celebrates 30 years of giving back. Team Depot was created in 1993 as a way of organizing associates who were eager to volunteer in their communities. For 30 years, Team Depot associates have worked side by side with non-profits around the United States. Focus areas include spending time with the elderly and activities with at risk youth. Team Depot also improves the homes and lives of veterans and helps communities impacted by natural disasters.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, Home Depot set a goal for battery-powered products to represent over 85% of outdoor lawn equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada by the end of fiscal 2028. Push lawn mowers and handheld leaf blowers and trimmers will run on rechargeable battery technology instead of gas.

Revenue jumped about 22% year over year to $39.87 billion, surpassing estimates by $470 million.\\n\\nJPMorgan gave important business updates during its latest Q3 earnings call and said:\\n\\nIn Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates.

There’s a good shot that’s right but longer term, we remain more optimistic on classic value. People remain enamored with growth investing.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\n\\nEV giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the top stock recommendations by ChatGPT for long-term gains. Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 79 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as of the end of the second quarter.\\n\\nBaron Partners Fund made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\"Many factors contributed to the strong performance of our largest Disruptive Growth position, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), in the period. Investors’ concerns regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in 2022 continue to dissipate, and the company’s business has continued to grow materially, although at below peak margins. Tesla’s deliveries in China are recovering. The company’s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company’s battery production expenses.\\n\\nWe continue to believe that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers.

Moreover, PYPL stock trades at bargain-basement levels and has a new, up-and-coming CEO. Additionally, I believe the Street is overly worried about threats to PayPal’s dominance.\\n\\nGiven all these points, growth-at-a-reasonable price (GARP) investors should buy the shares on weakness after they tumbled 23% in the last three months.\\n\\nA Growing, Profitable Leader\\n\\nIn the second quarter, PayPal’s top line climbed a robust 7.4% versus the same period a year earlier, coming in at $7.3 billion. Moreover, its volumes and transactions increased at least 10% year-over-year,\\xa0 while its operating income jumped 31.5% compared to a very strong $1.1 billion a year earlier.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nMeanwhile, PayPal appears to be the leader of the fintech sector, as the revenue of other top names in the industry, including Block (NYSE:SQ), SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI), and Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), are well below PayPal’s sales.\\n\\nFor example, PayPal’s 2022 top line came in at $27.5 billion, while Block generated revenue of $17.5 billion last year.\\n\\nExtremely Low Valuation and a Very Promising New CEO\\n\\nThe forward price-earnings ratio of PYPL stock is just ten, while its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also tiny, coming in at 11.7. Further, the company’s forward price-sales ratio is a diminutive two. The company’s high profits and rapid growth make its shares incredibly cheap.\\n\\nAlex Chriss became PayPal’s CEO on Sept. 27. In Chriss’ previous role, he led Intuit’s (NASDAQ:INTU) Small Business unit, whose revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate of 23% during his tenure. Additionally, the division’s “customer base” grew at a CAGR of 20% during that time. Given these statistics, I believe that Chriss has what it takes to significantly improve PayPal’s financial results and enable it to retain its role as America’s leading fintech company.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Street’s Overdone Concerns\\n\\nOn Sept. 13, investment bank MoffettNathanson cut its rating on PYPL stock to “market perform” from “outperform.” One of the key reasons for its downgrade was its belief that PayPal was coming under “fierce competitive pressure” from Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay.\\n\\nBut according to research firm Merchant Machine, Apple Pay’s share of the global payments market is only 7.4%, versus 20.5% for PayPal. Therefore, even if Apple Pay is increasing, as Moffett Nathanson and others report, it won’t pose much of a threat to PayPal anytime soon. And that reality is shown by PayPal’s impressive growth in Q2.\\n\\nOther reasons for the very low valuation of PYPL stock likely include worries about the outlook of e-commerce and concerns about the U.S. economy overall.\\n\\nHowever, as I’ve argued in past columns, I expect e-commerce’s growth to reaccelerate as “revenge travel” dies down. Meanwhile, concerns about the U.S. economy are tremendously overdone, as shown by the fact that U.S. retail sales climbed a very impressive 0.7% in September versus August. Moreover, the Federal Reserve predicts that the American economy surged a very impressive 5.4% above inflation in the third quarter.\\n\\nWhile the economy in Europe, where PayPal is also popular, is much weaker, I expect the EU’s economy to improve meaningfully in 2024, helped by lower interest rates and successful Chinese stimulus measures.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on PYPL Stock\\n\\nPayPal remains the fintech leader while it continues to generate impressive profits and its ridiculously low valuation. Further, concerns about its outlook are way overdone, and it has a new CEO who appears to be highly capable.\\n\\nIn light of these points, those long-term investors looking for a quickly growing tech stock with an attractive valuation should snap up PYPL stock.\\n\\nOn the publication date, Larry Ramer did not have (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

QQQ Advances in Late Trading as Tesla Rebounds: Markets Wrap\\n\\nTepid sales in China for its new iPhone models have fueled concerns about Apple’s ability to justify its pricey valuation and avoid a streak of four-consecutive quarters of falling revenue — which would be its worst run since 2001. That’s as the company grapples with political tensions with China and overheating devices, while KeyBanc this month became the latest firm to downgrade the stock.\\n\\nApple’s lack of growth and the high cost of its stock is creating a disconnect that’s hard to ignore, according to James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management.\\n\\n“Apple has some of the weakest growth among the megacaps, but the stock hasn’t de-rated to multiples it saw in previous periods when it wasn’t growing,” he said in an interview. Abate believes that investors should hedge against Apple’s valuation risk through put options, due to its “systemic” importance to the stock market.\\n\\nShares have dropped more than 10% since the end of July, compared with a decline of 5.4% for the Nasdaq 100 Index over that period. The slump has erased more than $340 billion in market value, though Apple remains the biggest component of the S&P 500 Index, accounting for more than 7.1% of the index weight.\\n\\nThat influence in markets makes it difficult for equity investors to avoid, but other megacaps may offer more enticing growth prospects and trade at more reasonable multiples.\\n\\n“You can make a compelling fundamental case for Amazon as a margin expansion story, for Microsoft and Nvidia as part of the AI craze, or for Alphabet and Meta weathering a slowdown in consumer advertising, but Apple has demonstrated no revenue growth for some time,” Abate said. “It isn’t like Cisco in 1999, about to fall off a cliff, but if we got a real dislocation in markets, the brunt would probably fall on stocks like Apple.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe company will report its fourth-quarter results in early November, and analysts expect to see revenue down 1% from the year-ago period. Revenue for the overall S&P 500 tech sector is seen up 1.5% this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, Apple trades at 26.5 times estimated earnings, above the multiple of the Nasdaq 100 Index and its own long-term average. It also trades at a premium in terms of forward sales, while its free-cash-flow yield is below 3.7%, compared with its 10-year average of about 6.4%.\\n\\nWhile revenue growth at Apple is expected to return to positive territory in its 2024 fiscal year, the pace is well off levels seen in recent years, and new product categories like its Vision Pro headset aren’t expected to become meaningful drivers anytime soon.\\n\\nThis has already caused some to step back. KeyBanc Capital Markets recently cut its view on the stock to the equivalent of a hold rating, citing concerns about the valuation and growth potential.\\n\\nFollowing a number of downgrades this year, the consensus rating on the stock — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — has dropped 9% off a December peak. Fewer than two-thirds of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying, by far the lowest ratio among megacaps.\\n\\n“There are always challenges, but this does seem like a trickier time, especially with the multiple being at the high end of the historical range,” said Michael Kirkbride, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. “We’re very cautious about adding to positions here, but would love to buy at a lower price.”\\n\\nDespite that, Kirkbride said Apple deserves the benefit of the doubt, given the company’s ability to navigate challenging times in the past.\\n\\n“Apple remains a top brand globally, it has unparalleled supply-chain expertise, and its free cash flow means that the return of capital is historically different than you get at other companies. It’s worth sticking around for that.”\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nNetflix Inc. shares rose 13% in premarket trading after the streaming-video company posted its best quarter for subscriber growth in years. The stock is on track for its biggest jump in a year. Analysts were positive about the company’s paid sharing feature reaping dividends, while KeyBanc Capital Markets raised its recommendation on the stock to overweight from sector weight.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nElon Musk is dialing back expectations for Tesla Inc. as years of rapid expansion collide with rising interest rates and a more cost-conscious consumer.

OpenAI is in talks to sell existing employees’ shares at an $86 billion valuation, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Nokia Oyj plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs, or 16% of its workforce, as a dearth of investment in fifth-generation mobile infrastructure forces it to take cost-cutting measures.

Powell’s speech in the spotlight\\n\\nJerome Powell is set to hold the spotlight Thursday, as the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at the Economic Club of New York later in the session, with markets nervous that he may strike a hawkish tone after a series of U.S. data pointed to strength in the economy.\\n\\nFed policy makers have recently signaled that the central bank may be close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, as rising yields have done some of their job in cooling the economy by reining in credit.\\n\\nHowever, recent data has indicated that the labor market remains strong and inflation sticky, and this prompted New York Federal Reserve president John Williams to take a more hawkish stance, stating Wednesday that the Fed will likely keep rates higher for longer for “some time” to rein in inflation toward its 2% target.\\n\\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield surged on Wednesday, trading past 4.9% for the first time since 2007.\\n\\nAnother pause on rate hikes for November is nearly fully priced in, according to Investing’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, but the odds of a December rate hike have jumped to 40% this week from 26% last week.\\n\\n2.

Netflix soars with new subscribers; Tesla disappoints\\n\\nNetflix’s subscription service was in demand in the third quarter, as the streaming giant shattered expectations for new customers, sending its stock surging over 12% in premarket trading.\\n\\nThe company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, boosted by its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts, well above expectations for just over 6 million.\\n\\nThese gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, in the early days of the global pandemic.\\n\\nSubstantial subscriber additions came in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where Netflix added nearly 4 million subscribers. More than 70% of its members now reside outside the United States.\\n\\nNetflix also increased subscription prices for some of its streaming plans as it posted revenue of $8.54 billion, in line with forecasts.

Third-quarter earnings season continues\\n\\nThe quarterly earnings season continues Thursday, with results due from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), telecoms company AT&T (NYSE:T), tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), railroad operator CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), asset manager Blackstone (NYSE:BX) as well as a number of regional banks.\\n\\nSo far, admittedly very early in the season, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.\\n\\nEarlier Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, posted an almost 25% fall in third-quarter net profit as global economic woes hit demand for chips used in applications from cars to cellphones and servers.\\n\\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs in a new cost reduction effort after the Finnish telecom gear manufacturer’s third-quarter sales fell by a fifth, taken down by sales of next-generation 5G equipment.\\n\\n5.

A new report from venture capital firm Accel found that U.S. technology companies have seen $2.4 trillion added to their market capitalizations this year from the hype and expectations surrounding generative AI. Accel’s analysis found the share prices of the biggest U.S. technology firms have risen an average of 36% so far in 2023 — much of that thanks to AI. Accel’s report also found that cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) are also benefitting from expectations surrounding AI, and have seen their stocks increase an average of 29% this year.\\n\\nGiven that AI technologies are widely considered to still be in their infancy, investors can expect big growth and sizable returns moving forward. Here are seven AI stocks that will change the world and create many millionaires in the process.\\n\\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\\n\\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nChinese tech firm Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has just come out and claimed it has developed a generative AI system that matches the technology used in the ChatGPT and GPT-4 chatbots. Analysts and investors are taking the claims seriously given that Baidu is widely regarded as China’s leading AI developer. And, until now, the AI systems coming out of China have paled in comparison to those produced by U.S. firms such as OpenAI. Baidu CEO Robin Li said at a public presentation recently that the company’s newly released ERNIE 4.0 chatbot “stands on par with GPT-4 in terms of overall performance.”\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe latest chatbot from Baidu is currently available to invited users only, though the company plans to roll it out more broadly in 2024. The previous version of Baidu’s ERNIE chatbot was ranked as the best among China’s tech companies based on its algorithm and development tools, according to market research firm IDC. News that a new version of the ERNIE chatbot is available and could rival the most advanced American technologies has come as a bit of a surprise given the stricter government controls placed around the development of AI within China. This development suggests Baidu might be further ahead than many U.S. companies in developing AI.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBIDU stock has risen 28% over the last 12 months.\\n\\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\\n\\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhat more can be said about microchip and semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) at this point? The company is the hands-down leader when it comes to AI and technology powering chatbots, large language learning models and supercomputers. OpenAI, the privately held company behind ChatGPT, is now considering making its own microchips because it can’t get Nvidia chips fast enough. That’s how great the demand is for Nvidia’s technology right now.\\n\\nMeeting the skyrocketing global demand for its chips and semiconductors is the main challenge facing Nvidia. It’s also why the company’s financial results have been crushing Wall Street expectations, why NVDA stock has tripled so far this year and is up more than 650% over five years. Many analysts and industry observers say that how far AI ultimately goes will largely depend on how powerful Nvidia’s future chips and semiconductors become. Any investor wanting to capitalize on the growth of AI should own NVDA stock.\\n\\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSince its initial public offering in 2004, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,\\xa0 NASDAQ:GOOGL) has created generational wealth for many investors. An investment of $15,000 in the company’s stock on its Aug. 19, 2004 IPO would be worth $1 million today. Going forward, Alphabet’s shares are likely to continue outperforming due in large part to the current catalyst the company has in AI. From its DeepMind research unit to the Bard chatbot and its smart home devices, Alphabet is pushing the envelope when it comes to AI. And the company is only starting to monetize the new technology.\\n\\nAlphabet’s leadership position in AI is beginning to reflect in the company’s share price, which has gained 57% year-to-date and is starting to pull ahead of other mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Analysts seem to be in agreement that Alphabet is among the best-positioned companies to benefit from future advances in AI. Unlike many AI companies, Alphabet is involved in all aspects of the technology, from the theory behind its development to its practical applications. GOOGL stock should respond accordingly.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\\n\\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhile it’s not as big a beneficiary of AI as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a dark horse in the race for artificial intelligence supremacy among microchip and semiconductor companies. Over the last two years, AMD’s share of the Data Center segment, including the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power AI models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, has nearly doubled to $1.3 billion. And, AMD is about to release a new AI microchip called the MI300X that many analysts see as a game changer. The MI300X marks AMD’s biggest push into AI yet and is a formidable rival to Nvidia’s strong AI microchip — the H100.\\n\\nAt the same time, AMD is getting closer to Microsoft and the two companies are forming strategic alliances for developing future AI technologies. Microsoft is increasing its use of AMD’s chips, and AMD is starting to develop chips specifically for Microsoft’s use. The two tech titans could form a strong future alliance. All of this activity is helping to power AMD’s financial results higher. The company is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 31. AMD expects full production of its MI300X microchip to ramp up now, with sales reflected in its earnings prints beginning in early 2024.\\n\\nAMD stock is up 64% this year and up 344% over five years.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\\n\\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nInvestors can’t currently buy shares of privately held OpenAI, the company that ushered in this year’s AI boom with the launch in November 2022 of ChatGPT, which some analysts refer to as the AI “Big Bang” moment. However, investors can do the next best thing — buy Microsoft stock. The software company invested $10 billion in OpenAI and has been aggressively capitalizing on the technology, adding it to its Bing search engine, as well as to video games and cloud computing. Microsoft is more closely associated with OpenAI than any other company.\\n\\nMicrosoft is continuing to push the bounds of AI forward, already using it to help healthcare companies make sense of their mountains of data. Many analysts say the AI catalyst is not yet reflected in MSFT stock, and there is plenty of upside ahead for stockholders. The median price target on Microsoft’s share price is currently $400, implying a 20% upside from current levels. The other thing that distinguishes Microsoft from other tech companies is its size and diversity. While AI offers the company a huge new market, it is only one area of strength. Microsoft is also a leader in video games, cloud computing and software. MSFT stock is up 39% so far in 2023.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\\n\\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe strategic importance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) to the world of AI, and the world at large for that matter, cannot be overstated. As the largest microchip and semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor is responsible for making over 60% of the world’s supply of advanced microchips, semiconductors and processors. The company’s strategic role provides it, and Taiwan, with what’s called a “silicon shield.” It’s been estimated that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan would disrupt over $2 trillion in economic activity by severing the primary source of advanced chips and semiconductors from global supply chains, crippling the tech industry in the process.\\n\\nCompanies ranging from Nvidia to Apple rely on Taiwan Semiconductor, as do most governments. Without its foundry business, advancements in AI technologies would grind to a halt. As such, TSM stock is a very good one to own. Even Warren Buffett praised Taiwan Semiconductor as one of the world’s best-run companies. While Buffett sold most of his stake in TSM stock over geopolitical concerns, he said he continues to greatly admire the company’s operations and the wide competitive moat around its business and stock. TSM stock is up 43% over the last 12 months and has risen 137% over five years.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\\n\\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhat metaverse? For Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), it is now all about AI. The company, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has pivoted hard this year towards AI and largely abandoned its previous plan to create a digital realm known as the metaverse — a place consumers would access through its virtual reality headsets. While the headsets still figure into the company’s plans, they are more likely to gain access to AI applications than buying a virtual house in the virtual world. At the company’s Meta Connect developer conference held in September, it was all about AI.\\n\\nAt the conference, Meta unveiled several generative AI chatbots and announced other AI technologies aimed at positioning the company as a competitor to OpenAI and especially Alphabet. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta Platforms is launching a text-to-image platform called Emu that will be available across several apps, and adding AI photo editing tools to its Instagram social media platform. Plus, Meta recently introduced a new AI Studio platform that enables developers to build their own AI chatbots.

Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reports on this story—breaking down consumer trends and what to expect in fourth quarter for the tech company.\\n\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nJOSH LIPTON: A top Apple analyst has a warning for investors about demand for MacBook computers [INAUDIBLE] of the company's fourth quarter earnings. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the story. So Dan, what is happening do we think over at Apple?\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah. Ming-Chi Kuo, he's at TF International Securities, had this post out saying that Mac sales are going to plummet in this quarter, essentially saying that it's going to fall off a cliff. And that we can expect to see revenues in that sector decline because of the back-to-school sales being over and, generally, consumers not needing to buy as many, as we see a kind of return to office versus work from home sale not necessarily starting to come together.\\n\\nSo there's also a decline in consumer interest, he says, in the mini-LED MacBooks as well as the Apple silicon that goes into MacBooks, so the M2 chips. There should be an M31 coming. And maybe that'll start to goose sales for Apple in the next year. But he says that nothing's coming in Q4. So this is basically what Apple's got.\\n\\nLet's just go over some of the numbers, though. We were checking them out for a second there. In Q3 2023, we saw $6.8 billion for Mac sales. That's down from the $7.3 billion we saw in Q3 2022. Overall, Apple sales, though, were down across the board, whether that was iPhone, whether that was iPad. We saw a slight bump in wearables and services, but hardware really getting slammed there.\\n\\nAnd that's just generally what we've seen across the general tech landscape, where people aren't necessarily going out to buy new devices based on fears over high inflation, high interest rates. And so they were holding back. There's also just, you know, don't forget these insane number of people that went out and bought during the pandemic. And now they just don't feel like they need stuff quite yet.\\n\\nThere was a report that came out from IDC-- excuse me, Gartner, saying that they would see a rebound in PC sales in 2024. So that may help build things up for Apple. But in that same report, they said that Apple was going to be stung especially bad in the current year. So we could start to see things turn around as more people start to get into that cycle of purchasing devices again.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-macbook-sales-fall-analyst-210824561.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.464, 'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.046}}, {'date': '2023-10-18T19:22:00+00:00', 'title': 'How the NBA Plans to Remake TV Deals and Net Billions of Dollars for Its Stars', 'content': 'The league seeks a big increase in media-rights fees by luring streamers, from Amazon to Apple, and offering games in local markets.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e25a7970-57b0-3db3-ab21-370f776be611/how-the-nba-plans-to-remake.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'CMCS34.SA', 'CMCSA.MX', 'CMCSA.US', 'CTP2.F', 'DIS.MX', 'DIS.US', 'DISB34.SA', 'WDP.F', 'WDP.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.459, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.16}}, {'date': '2023-10-18T17:49:03+00:00', 'title': '3 Stocks to Buy for the Next 25 Years', 'content': 'Over the past 25 years, certain stocks to buy have topped the charts and had undeniably incredible gains. Monster Beverage’s (NASDAQ:MNST) and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) gains have been a direct result of adapting their business to meet changing consumer choices. This can be seen in Apple’s yearly technological developments or Monster’s recent release of alcoholic beverages.\\r\\n It’s conceivable that either one of these could be the top stocks to buy for the next 25 years.\\n\\nHowever, while I love both businesses, selecting three other stocks to buy that look to achieve market-beating returns over the next 25 years makes sense.\\n\\nHere are my choices.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nCelsius Holdings (CELH)\\n\\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\\n\\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is the modern version of Monster Beverage. In November 2020, I suggested that the functional drink maker was a micro-cap stock to buy and hold for the next 10 years. It’s up 432% in the three years since.\\n\\nIn my article, I pointed out that the company’s gross margins were 45.8%, about 15 percentage points less than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). However, I expected them to improve as they gained scale in the U.S. and elsewhere.\\n\\nCelsius’s gross margins in Q2 2023 were 48.8%, 1,030 basis points higher than a year earlier. Coca-Cola’s Q2 2023 gross margins were 59.4%, closing the gap by 360 basis points. I expect the gap to continue to shrink over the next three years.\\n\\nIn the first six months of 2023, the company’s revenues were $585.8 million, 104% higher year-over-year. It will undoubtedly exceed $1 billion in annual sales by the end of 2023. More importantly, its net margin in the second quarter was 12.5%, up considerably from 6.0% a year ago.\\n\\nAnd let’s not forget the investment and distribution partnershipPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) signed with Celsius in August 2022. Pepsi invested $550 million in the company and became its official U.S. distributor.\\n\\nThis has Monster success written all over it.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNvidia (NVDA)\\n\\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMy biggest concern with picking Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is that CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang won’t be around for 25 years. He’s easily one of America’s best CEOs.\\n\\nIn September 2021, I said that Huang was America’s most influential CEO, pointing out that a $10,000 investment in the chip designer in its January 1999 IPO was worth $8.5 million. Fast forward to 2023, and it’s more than doubled to approximately $17 million.\\n\\nThe company’s push into artificial intelligence (AI) hit a bit of a speed bump recently when the U.S. federal government announced new restrictions on American firms exporting AI chips to China.\\n\\nNvidia’s slower versions of the H800 and A800 chips were added to the list of restricted exports. On October 17, CNBC reported that U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s commented: reporters on October 17.\\n\\n“The updates are specifically designed to control access to computing power, which will significantly slow the PRC’s development of next-generation frontier model, and could be leveraged in ways that threaten the U.S. and our allies, especially because they could be used for military uses and modernization.”\\n\\nAs a result, NVDA shares dropped on the company’s admission that sales would fall in the long term. Frankly, it will be a blip on the radar, given Nvidia’s dominance in AI-related chips.\\r\\n It’s going to be just fine.\\n\\nProcore Technologies (PCOR)\\n\\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nProcore Technologies (NYSE:PCOR) is a leading provider of construction management software. The company’s software has helped complete more than $1 trillion in construction projects.\\n\\nWith $14 trillion in construction spending estimated in 2025, the company has a significant opportunity to capture a big chunk of this spending.\\n\\nLike most software businesses, AI is a big part of the selling proposition. On September 19, Procore announced the launch of Procore Copilot, which uses AI to enable its customers to automate processes on the Procore platform. CEO Tooey Courtemanche stated in the press release:\\n\\n“By leveraging artificial intelligence, we’re able to reflect this data back to our customers in the form of valuable insights to not only help them solve issues quickly, but to anticipate them before they happen.”\\n\\nAccording to its press release, 18% of project time is spent searching for data, dramatically reducing efficiency.\\n\\nAs its September Investor Presentation highlights, the company has over 15,700 customers using its software platform, with more than a million monthly web users. That’s growing dramatically.\\n\\nIn Q2 2023, Procore added 615 net new organic customers, generating revenue of $229 million, 33% higher than Q2 2022. For 2023, it expects revenue of at least $921 million, 28% higher than in 2022. While it will lose money in 2023, look for it to become profitable in 2024 and beyond.\\n\\nAlthough PCOR stock is up 40% year-to-date, it’s sideways from its May 2021 IPO price of $67, so you still have time to get on board this option in stocks to buy.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I would, however, start with a promising oil and gas stock that can be a massive value creator.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nEven with the shift toward renewable energy, the oil demand will likely remain strong through the decade. With geopolitical tensions, I will not be surprised if oil at $100 per barrel is the new normal.\\n\\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is a potential trillion-dollar stock in the next five years. Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet and assets with an attractive break-even. Considering the potential operating and free cash flow, I expect significant value creation.\\n\\nTo put things into perspective, Brent oil averaged $100.9 per barrel last year. Chevron reported operating cash flow of $47.5 billion for 2022. Given the cash flow potential, value creation will come through dividends and share repurchases.\\n\\nAdditionally, there is ample headroom to make big capital investments to ensure steady earnings growth. Chevron is targeting an annual investment of $14 to $16 billion for the next few years.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is another name poised to join the list of trillion-dollar stocks in the next five years. The manufacturer of integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 18.4.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Taiwan Semiconductor is an innovator and commands a leading market share. Taiwan Semiconductor is credited for developing 7-nanometer foundry technology. With ambitious expansion overseas plans, the company is targeting revenue growth at a compound annual growth (CAGR) of 15% to 20% through 2026.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor is positioned to benefit from the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. The company wants to invest in an advanced chip packaging plant to cater to the incremental demand. TSM is already building a $40 billion chip factory in Arizona, and there are speculations that the advanced chip packing factory is likely. These investments ensure the company meets its revenue growth target.\\n\\nSalesforce (CRM)\\n\\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock has witnessed a healthy upside of 55% year-to-date. I believe this potential trillion-dollar stock’s positive momentum will likely be sustained. In the next five years, CRM stock seems poised for five-bagger returns.\\n\\nThe first point to note is that Salesforce has a large addressable market. By 2026, the company estimates a market size worth $290 billion. If this holds true, there is visibility for sustained growth and cash flow upside.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that Salesforce has been pursuing aggressive international expansion. As of FY 2023, the company derived 37% of its revenue from international markets. Geographic expansion is another growth catalyst.\\n\\nRevenue growth has translated into operating leverage, which implies robust cash flow visibility. For Q2 2024, Salesforce reported a free cash flow of $628 million. This would imply an annualized FCF potential of $2.5 billion, likely to impact valuations positively.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know', 'content': \"Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\\n\\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 1.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\\n\\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\\n\\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\\n\\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\\n\\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, indicating a change of +7.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\\n\\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.05 points to a change of -1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.56 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\\n\\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\\n\\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\\n\\n12 Month EPS\\n\\nProjected Revenue Growth\\n\\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\\n\\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $88.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $382.72 billion and $404.82 billion estimates indicate -2.9% and +5.8% changes, respectively.\\n\\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\\n\\nApple reported revenues of $81.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%. EPS of $1.26 for the same period compares with $1.20 a year ago.\\n\\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.54%. The EPS surprise was +5.88%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\\n\\nValuation\\n\\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\\n\\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\\n\\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\\n\\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As the manager of the Ark Invest family of exchange traded funds (ETFs), Wood boldly predicts Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will be worth $1.5 million by 2030 and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock will have a $2,000 per share price tag by 2027. So, Wood is not shy about looking to the future and guessing where the world will be. Her ETFs are representative of some of the most disruptive technologies available. From artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and autonomous robotaxis to digital payments, electric vehicles, and blockchain technology, they are all part of what Wood says are “technological breakthroughs evolving today and creating the potential for super-exponential growth tomorrow.” So, when she took notice of several digital leisure stocks, so did we.\\n\\nEarlier this year she released her Big Ideas 2023 report that’s full of dramatic predictions of life-altering changes to come. One of the boldest forecasts concerns the growth of the digital consumer. That includes spending on online goods and services, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), online sports betting, video game software and services, and streaming video and audio. Expenditures in these fields will grow from not-so-humble beginnings of $6.6 trillion in 2022 to a massive $22.5 trillion opportunity by 2030.\\n\\nBecause the investment possibilities span numerous industries, here are seven of the best digital leisure stocks to buy to capitalize on this immense growth trajectory.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nRoku (ROKU)\\n\\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nConnected TV (CTV) is seen as one of the defining growth markets for the digital consumer. Some 85% of all U.S. households have access to at least one CTV, but their ad market is just 23% of total TV ad spending. The Big Ideas report says “CTV is at an inflection point and will take share from both linear TV and other digital ad budgets.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) seems uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift. The number of active Roku accounts grew 16% in the second quarter from last year to 73.5 million on the strength of its Roku TV licensing program. Roku;s operating system continues to be the top-selling TV OS in the U.S., and Roku’s market share is larger than the next three largest TV OSs combined.\\n\\nWood also puts her money where her mouth is. Roku is the third largest holding in her Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) behind Tesla and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) with a current market value of over $535 million.\\n\\nWood has a $605 per share price target on Roku stock. That’s a near ten-fold increase needed by 2026 from its current levels. That doesn’t seem possible now, but longer term could be achievable. This stock easily earned its spot on our list of the best digital leisure stocks.\\n\\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\\n\\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWood says “the convergence of video games and social media should sustain gaming revenue growth.” Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably best poised to capture the lion’s share of the money spent here with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).\\n\\nThe tech giant is about to close its $69 billion takeover of the video game publisher after British regulators signed off on the transaction. That gives Microsoft access to some of the most important gaming titles on the market. Activision’s World of Warcraft remains the biggest massively multiplayer online (MMO) game with almost 121 million total players. In comparison, runner up Final Fantasy XIV Online has nearly 40 million. Call of Duty also continues to be a top game franchise with a fresh reboot of Modern Warfare II.\\n\\nBecause Microsoft agreed to sell the online streaming rights to Activision’s IP portfolio to the U.K.’s Ubisoft Entertainment (OTCMKTS:UBSFY), the path to approval was sealed.\\n\\nWarren Buffett, however, dumped his Activision stake when it seemed like the deal wouldn’t be approved. While he bought shares mostly as an arbitrage play on the transaction, investors in Microsoft can still see the video game publisher take the stock to the next level. If you are looking for digital leisure stocks to buy, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nApple (AAPL)\\n\\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nYou might be surprised to think of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as another top gaming platform, but the tech leader happens to be the third largest player in the space by revenue. How can that be since it doesn’t produce any video games or software on its own? Because it takes a 30% cut of every single transaction made through the App Store, whether an app purchase or an in-game transaction. The commission drops to 15% after a year or if the developer earns less than $1 million in annual App Store sales.\\n\\nStill, the $15 billion or so in annual revenue it rakes in makes it amongst the highest sales generators in gaming. Apple announced back in May the App Store had generated more than $1.1 trillion in 2022, with two-thirds of that coming from mobile games. Services like App Store are where Apple’s future growth will come from.\\n\\nThe tech stock is also developing its own alternate reality headset, called Apple Vision Pro , or “spatial computing,” as Apple refers to it. It will allow users to feel the physicality of digital objects.\\n\\nConsider Apple stock as a backdoor way to get into gaming with a big tech boost to juice returns.\\n\\nThe Trade Desk (TTD)\\n\\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAnother play on the CTV market is The Trade Desk (NYSE:TTD). It is the premier software provider for advertisers targeting specific online audiences. It remains one of the best stocks in the business and is the largest independent demand-side platform. While this may not be the first on you think about when it comes to digital leisure stocks, hear us out on it.\\n\\nThe Trade Desk charges its customers a 20% commission for the privilege of buying advertising on its platform. It might appear audacious on its face, but it indicates just how good the company is at what it does. Clients obviously like the results they get because they continue to spend more money on the platform than they did previously. Second quarter revenue jumped 23% year over year with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 200 basis points to 39%.\\n\\nAd buyers also returned in droves, allowing The Trade Desk to achieve a 95% customer retention rate. It’s a record it has maintained for over nine consecutive years.\\n\\nThe total addressable market for the advertising industry is moving rapidly toward $1 trillion. Notably, the privacy features Apple recently launched for iOS users that created a huge tumult in the online ad industry impose little to no impact on The Trade Desk’s business.\\n\\nAs Wood notes, digital advertising has a long runway of growth pushed higher by the CTV tailwind. Look for The Trade Desk to ride that wave for years to come.\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWith four of the biggest social media apps to its name, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) will also win the digital ad game. Wood points out that because 40% of Gen Z consumers use the likes of TikTok and Instagram to search the way their parents use Google, “social platforms with the best recommendation engines should command the majority of ad budgets.”\\n\\nMeta, of course, owns Instagram, along with Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Its Threads “Twitter killer app” remains a work in progress. Its primary social media apps have a combined 3.9 billion monthly active users. Because there are an estimated 4.9 billion social media users worldwide, or 60% of the global population, Meta has an outsized influence on what people see and hear.\\n\\nTikTok is a threat to be sure. As of 2022, it accounted for just $10 billion in search, video, and social media advertising, or about 2% of the $470 billion total. Yet it is rapidly nearing exceeding that taken in by Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter.\\n\\nStill, Meta’s willingness to “borrow” the best ideas from its competitors means it should do well for the foreseeable future. Its TikTok knockoff Reels enjoys over 200 billion daily plays. New ad features could result in the apps becoming substantial revenue contributors on their own.\\n\\nDraftKings (DKNG)\\n\\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOne of the remaining big avenues for digital leisure spending is online sports betting. After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on sports betting as unconstitutional in 2018, it spread to 36 states. DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is the second largest sportsbook behind Flutter Entertainment‘s (OTCMKTS:PDYPF) FanDuel and operates in 21 states.\\n\\nDraftKings has 2.1 million active monthly users, or about half of FanDuel’s total. Yet FanDuel’s market share slipped to 47% from 50% while DraftKing’s share grew to 35%. That’s DraftKing’s highest share in three years.\\n\\nWood’s Big Ideas report forecasts online sports betting will expand at a 27% compounded annual growth rate through 2027. The industry will hit $330 billion in volume by then. That’s far faster than the 11% growth rate estimated for in-person betting, which will total just $27 billion.\\n\\nThere may be more states coming online too. Kentucky, North Carolina, Vermont, and Puerto Rico all passed legislation that will allow for mobile sports betting. An additional 12 states are considering allowing it as well.\\n\\nOnline gambling could provide additional growth in the future. After its acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming in 2022, DraftKings is now the market share leader in a number of states. Most of the share loss has come from rival MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM).\\n\\nWood recently sold off some of her stake in DraftKings. She was taking profits after the sportsbook’s meteoric rise this year. Shares are up 150% so far. The investing guru owns about 13.3 million shares, down from her peak holdings of 24 million shares a year ago. Still, it’s a serious commitment to the sportsbook. DraftKings is rapidly changing the game for all digital leisure stocks.\\n\\nSpotify (SPOT)\\n\\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nFilling out the card in the seventh spot is music streaming platform Spotfiy (NYSE:SPOT). It is the world’s largest audio streaming company with 551 million monthly active users. Of that total, 220 million are premium subscribers. It added record numbers of new users in the second quarter. Revenue from subscription-based and ad-supported channels are growing at double-digit rates.\\n\\nYet there’s no doubt Spotify deserves the fair bit of criticism it comes in for from critics. It is all too willing to throw money at a perceived opportunity. The $200 million Spotify spent to lure Joe Rogan to the platform is arguably well spent. Other initiatives leave it with mounting losses. Losses doubled in the second quarter from the year-ago period and widened from the first quarter.\\n\\nThe stock doubled in value this year and it holds lofty valuations. Yet it is the leader despite some well-financed rivals like Apple Music and YouTube Music. Spotify, though, remains the go-to destination. Management says it is reining in spending, being more targeted in its efforts. CEO Daniel Elk told investors earlier this year, “In hindsight, I probably got a little carried away and overinvested.” He’s being more tight-fisted now and fired 6% of Spotify’s employees.\\n\\nSpotify stock may be the riskiest of the bunch in terms of valuation. As a long-term investment, it should be a good bet on the rise of the digital consumer.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\\xa0InvestorPlace.com\\xa0Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Innovative States in the US.\\n\\nInnovation: The Future of America\\n\\nOne of the key drivers of the US economy is innovation. The United States is one of the most innovative countries in the world as it continues to pour hefty investments in research and development. On February 28, McKinseyreported that the United States has dedicated a federal funding of $2 trillion to foster innovation over the next 10 years.\\n\\nThe United States is home to various innovation hubs which offer state-of-the-art research and development facilities, quality education institutions, and incubators. Apart from the established innovation hubs in Boston and Silicon Valley, new innovation setups are appearing across other areas including Indiana and Tulsa. These centers of innovation are of profound importance since they account for 80% of the engineers and patents in the country, while contributing 60% to the country's overall exports.\\n\\nThe growth in the most innovative regions is also fueled by educated talent. These areas have the ability to attract the potential workforce. Academic centers play an important role in building the right kind of talent for an innovative future. Since innovation hubs attract many companies, abundant employment opportunities emerge for those who have adequate skills. Another important factor that contributes to innovation is how easily startups can avail pre-seed and seed funding since they might not have enough capital to invest in the beginning. These startups can utilize the capabilities of high level R&D throughout their journey, from early idea proposition to final product commercialization. You can also take a look at some of the US states with the lowest business taxes.\\n\\nCompanies Leading Innovation Globally\\n\\nRenowned companies that have the most innovative products to offer in the US include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). You can also view the country's top states for business in 2023.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOn September 14, Reutersreported that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been working on a disruptive innovation that could alter the way it makes electric vehicles, by casting the EV underbody in one piece. This approach is based on creating large sub-assemblies of a car and then binding them together. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has plans to launch cheaper electric vehicles while locking in high profits in the future. It has also been speculated that the unique manufacturing technique would enable the company to manufacture a car completely within 18 to 24 months, as compared to an average manufacturing time of 3 to 4 years taken by the company's competitors.\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) utilizes cutting edge technology to come up with world-class innovative products. On October 17, the companyreported the upcoming launch of its new Apple Pencil in early November. The Apple Pencil will be compatible with iPads having a USB-C port. Greater drawing precision will be facilitated by the product. Back in June, one of the innovative ideas from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) materialized in the form of its new Vision Pro headset, the company’s first ever mixed reality headset and the first spatial operating system worldwide. The company alsointroduced its new MacBook Air as the best and the thinnest 15-inch laptop in the world.\\n\\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company which transforms the landscape of health and well-being in America and across the globe. The company was one of the first in the industry to launch a vaccine for the global pandemic, Coronavirus. The recent developments from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) have been quite novel. The company has been working on an mRNA-based vaccine for Lyme disease which will be a new kind of HIV vaccine. The vaccine under development is a major breakthrough considering that Lyme disease affects approximately half a million Americans every year. On September 7, Reutersreported that the company posted positive results for the phase 2 trial of the vaccine. Overall, the vaccine shots have been safe among children and adults.\\xa0 The phase 3 of the clinical trials are being carried out by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and the partnering firm, Valneva. The companies aim to seek authorization for the vaccine by 2026.\\n\\nNow that we have taken a look at some of the most innovative companies in the US, let's take a look at the 20 most innovative states in the US. 20 Most Innovative States in the US\\n\\n20 Most Innovative States in the US\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nIn order to compile a list of the 20 most innovative states in the US, we sourced data from the Consumer Technology Association’sinteractive map.

If you want to skip our discussion on the podcast industry and its growth, as well as its outlook over the years, head directly to the 5 Best Investing Podcasts in 2023.\\n\\nBack in 2005, the term \"podcast\" was selected as the Word of the Year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. During June of that year, Steve Jobs enthusiastically emphasized podcasts as a vital component of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\'s future. He inquired, \"What exactly is podcasting?\" and described it as a form akin to \"Wayne\\'s World for radio,\" illustrating that it enabled anyone to create and distribute a podcast with minimal investment, reaching a global audience for their radio-style show. Podcasting, sometimes referred to as on-demand radio, entails pre-recorded digital content that users can stream or download for offline listening or viewing via subscriptions, accessible on various playback devices. The inception of podcasts into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\'s iTunes portfolio in 2005 can be regarded as the beginning of the podcast format\\'s presence in the broader audio landscape. Nevertheless, traditional formats like commercial radio and broadcast television maintained their stronghold on media market shares over the subsequent decade and beyond.\\n\\nDon\\'t Miss: Biggest Radio Companies in the US\\n\\nYet, changes in digital consumption habits, especially noticeable among younger age groups, as evidenced by the median ages of podcast listeners (34), broadcast radio (47), and network TV (57), have propelled the podcast industry into substantial growth in both listener base and revenue. Worldwide, there are an excess of 400 million individuals who engage with various types of content through podcasts. Given this substantial listenership, there are over 2 million autonomous podcasts, collectively hosting tens of millions of episodes. According to a report by market research firm Grand View Research, the size of the worldwide podcasting market reached a valuation of approximately $18.52 billion in 2022. Forecasts suggest that the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.6% from 2023 to 2030.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSince the inception of podcasts, advertising has stood as the primary revenue-generating avenue for content creators. However, its adoption has faced challenges, as audiences tend to avoid advertisements interrupting their content consumption. Nevertheless, brands are actively devising innovative strategies to diversify revenue streams. Content creators are proposing monthly subscription models, offering consumers the option to pay per episode or on a monthly basis. In another vein, the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain technologies has made a substantial impact on market growth. Additionally, the integration of cutting-edge technologies into content, such as Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), advancements in transcription technology, and the introduction of paid live podcast events, is poised to propel the podcast industry\\'s growth. For example, music streaming giant Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT)\\'s Spotify Ad Studio, leveraging streaming media intelligence technology, empowers advertisers to tailor their messages precisely, ensuring they reach the appropriate audience with fitting content at the opportune moment.\\n\\nPodcasts have proven to be a profitable revenue stream for media firms. A prime example is iHeartMedia, which filed for bankruptcy in 2018 but bounced back, ending the subsequent year with revenue exceeding $3.68 billion due to its digital ventures and foray into podcasting. Simultaneously, the rising popularity and potential of this format compelled Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in podcast-related acquisitions, including the renowned company Gimlet. Retail giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also has plans to enter this industry, signaling potential disruptions and heightened competition within the market. 16 Best Investing Podcasts in 2023\\n\\nPhoto by Jonathan Velasquez on Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo create our compilation of the 16 Best Investing Podcasts in 2023, we carefully reviewed numerous lists presented by credible sources, including Audible, The Investor\\'s Podcast Network, and FeedSpot, among others, featuring some of the most famous and highest rated podcasts, and amalgamated them into a consolidated meta-list.

According to a new report from Accel, AI helped big tech up its market cap by $2.4 trillion in the last year, with companies, including Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, and Nvidia, of course, seeing their values jump by an average of 36% year over year.\\n\\nAnd of course, we mentioned Nvidia there-- clearly the big winner of the year as soon as all of this came out. But then you saw every company coming out with some sort of strategy to say that, oh, we're including AI. Even if it wasn't proven yet, it was enough to lift some of these tech stocks.\\n\\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Nvidia shares up more than 200% on the year. When you look at some of the other big tech names, we are averaging roughly 36%. But it's worth noting that the first half of the year was about the hype. The latter half, really, is about, well, where exactly is the revenue?\\n\\nAnd we have seen companies, those valuations, start to come down a little because they haven't necessarily been able to prove out their strategy of that revenue pouring in right away. Nvidia is a different case, because we have seen really strong numbers coming through from there. But you could point to even a name like ARM.\\n\\nYou look at that roughly $5 billion IPO, so much excitement initially around its potential for AI. But since then, we have seen Wall Street turn a little more cautious on the name because they haven't seen that strategy pan out. So, yes, AI still very much in focus-- companies certainly honing in on the potential opportunity there.\\n\\nBut we have seen the exuberance pull back just a little because investors are saying, well, show me the money, right? I mean, show me where exactly that revenue is coming in from-- a story, of course, we're continuing to follow there.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-raised-big-tech-market-160305991.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.995, 'neg': 0.004, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.137}}, {'date': '2023-10-17T15:40:52+00:00', 'title': \"Could Huawei device sales overtake Apple's iPhone 15 in China?\", 'content': 'Apple\\'s (AAPL) iPhone 15 sales are reportedly slumping among Chinese consumers, down 4.5% compared to the first few weeks of the iPhone 14\\'s sales.

Does that point to success and, you know, I have to say, with foldable phones? Because this is one area that has garnered a lot of attention, either for better or for worse. But are foldable phones actually seeing more success than, perhaps, we even anticipated?\\n\\nNABILA POPAL: Foldable phones are getting-- and Huawei, actually, was always a pioneer in that field, even before, I believe, Samsung released the first foldable, right? So they do make excellent devices. And the foldable segment themselves have gained a lot of traction.\\n\\nBut unfortunately, Huawei is really right now not really shipping much outside of China. So for the momentum of the foldable segment, which it is growing at double digits, even this year where the overall smartphone market will decline by about 6%, 7%, we are expecting to see foldables grow by 50%. But again, that\\'s coming from a small base. But unfortunately, Huawei is not going to benefit as much from that because it\\'s only looking at, you know, phones in China.\\n\\nSEANA SMITH: Nabila, when it comes to the perception of Apple in China, how much of a headwind that could potentially be given the escalating chip wars that\\'s going on, the geopolitical tension between the two companies-- when it comes to what that means looking historically at sales, how much of an impact does it typically have?\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNABILA POPAL: So you want to understand, like, how much Huawei will impact . Apple and I know there\\'s been so many stories, and data, or conjecture about Apple\\'s performance and how it could potentially be hit, whether it\\'s from the government ban or, really, this resurgence of Huawei.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ve seen Apple grow, whether you look at their own proportion of their own shipments from being 16% back in 2019 coming from China, to now almost a quarter of their shipments coming from China-- or within China themselves, Apple\\'s growth trajectory. So 2019, and I\\'m looking at a longer time frame just to show the trajectory of Apple\\'s growth.\\n\\nThey grew from about 9% share in 2019 to now almost 16% share. That\\'s in \\'23. But now, all the talk is, right, this government ban, and Huawei\\'s resurgence, how will Apple suddenly-- will that flip-flop again?\\n\\nAnd from our analysis and my own personal conjecture is that we don\\'t think that it\\'s going to be as quick of a flip-flop. Even if Huawei devices, and, again, as it\\'s shown in the weekly data that we\\'ve been reading about or talking about that Huawei has done really well and has a lot of interest from consumers-- we don\\'t think this is necessarily going to mean within one year there\\'s a flip-flop of performance from Huawei and Apple.\\n\\nI think there will be a lot of-- it will take a lot of time for Huawei to gain back that lost share, especially it used to be-- if you look at just-- if you zone in on just the premium segment within China, Huawei at its peak had about 58% share. So premium, talking about $800-plus devices, while Apple had about 35%.\\n\\nAnd now, unfortunately, and I\\'m talking about, like, prior to this as of Q2, Apple share in the premium went up to 72% and Huawei\\'s went down to, like, just 16%, 15%. And so does this mean like next quarter next year it\\'s going to be Huawei again 70% and Apple at under 20%?\\n\\nI don\\'t think so. Apple as a brand has what we like to call, like, yes, everyone understands the concept of brand loyalty, right? Yes, brand loyalty, but also brand stickiness. It\\'s very hard-- stickiness being like once you are there, it\\'s very hard to pull out. You\\'re kind of stuck to that brand, and the OS system in general.\\n\\nAnd Apple has a great degree of that. So it\\'s going to be very difficult for Huawei, even if they are successful, even if the performance of the long term of the phones does do well, to pull back and gain that-- it might gain some share, but I don\\'t think it will be a flip-flop, if that makes sense.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/could-huawei-device-sales-overtake-154052068.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.998, 'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.146}}, {'date': '2023-10-17T14:00:00+00:00', 'title': '2 Unstoppable Warren Buffett Stocks That Can Turn Sitting Cash into Growing Wealth', 'content': 'These companies are leaders in high-growth sectors and could offer significant gains over the long term.\\n\\nContinue reading', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1ed17df5-5e10-3cb1-8076-46e9c486f20f/2-unstoppable-warren-buffett.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.494, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.208}}, {'date': '2023-10-17T13:19:19+00:00', 'title': \"Morning Brew: Microsoft's Accelerated Growth, Lockheed Martin's Q3 Earnings Beat, and Apple ...\", 'content': 'Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares slipped fractionally in pre-market trading on Tuesday even as investment firm Loop Capital started coverage on the tech giant with a buy rating.

Photo: Weibo alt=Apple chief executive Tim Cook takes a selfie with Chinese singer Vivi Jiang Yingrong outside an Apple Store in Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province, during his latest visit to China last week. Photo: Weibo>\\n\\nCook\\'s latest visit underscores the importance of mainland China, which has the world\\'s biggest number of internet users and largest smartphone market, as Apple\\'s manufacturing hub and major overseas market.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn March, Cook met Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao and other top officials as part of a delegation of C-level executives and scholars from overseas who attended the government-organised China Development Forum in Beijing.\\n\\nThe senior officials reassured the delegation\\'s representatives that China would continue to open up and provide a top-tier business environment in spite of changes in geopolitical affairs.\\n\\nCook\\'s latest China trip, however, comes at a time when the latest iteration of Apple\\'s iPhone is facing stiff competition in the premium segment of the country\\'s smartphone market.\\n\\n\"China\\'s headline numbers for the [iPhone] 15 series are in the red, and this is a reflection of the broader decline in consumer spending [in the country],\" said Counterpoint Research analyst Mengmeng Zhang in a market report published on Monday.\\n\\nThe first 17 days of iPhone 15 sales were down 4.5 per cent in China compared to the launch of the iPhone 14 last year, according to data from Counterpoint. Still, the research firm cited shorter pre-holiday shopping periods, coupled with supply mismatches on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as contributing factors to that performance.\\n\\nIn addition, the new iPhone 15 series is competing with a resurgent Huawei Technologies, which recently released its new Mate 60 Pro and Mate 60 Pro+ 5G handsets that are powered by an advanced, made-in-China mystery chip, igniting patriotic fervour among local consumers.\\n\\n\"China\\'s premium smartphone market is becoming increasingly crowded, and related to that, there\\'s been some impact from the Mate 60 series from a marketing perspective,\" Counterpoint associate director Ethan Qi said on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"All of these things are working together to take some of the shine away from Apple\\'s lustre during the first few weeks of iPhone 15 sales,\" Qi added.\\n\\nDuring his visit to Chengdu, Cook reportedly also showed up at a Tencent Holdings video gaming tournament for Honour of Kings. This is a stalwart game on the App Store and the Chinese internet giant\\'s marquee mobile title that in 2020 became the first game in history across any platform to average more than 100 million daily active users.\\n\\nCook\\'s latest trip also comes as Apple deals with the country\\'s strict censorship laws. Apple recently had to toughen its app developer policy in compliance with Chinese regulations, which require apps to receive government approval before these are made available on the company\\'s Chinese App Store.\\n\\nThat move, which is expected to severely shrink the number of apps on Apple\\'s local iOS platform, was made after internet regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China published a list of the country\\'s properly registered \"app distribution platforms\" under regulations introduced last year, with Apple notably absent.\\n\\nApple had been meeting with regulators to voice concerns about the policies, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, in efforts that appear to have failed.\\n\\nThe App Store shake-up follows sources telling the Post in September that some Chinese government workers had been told to stop using Apple\\'s iPhones at work, citing national security risks amid heightened geopolitical tensions with the United States.\\n\\nIn a separate report on Tuesday, Counterpoint said the global smartphone market had recorded its lowest third-quarter sales in a decade, declining 8 per cent year on year.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The event featured Tencent\\'s smash hit Honor of Kings, the top mobile game by revenue for the first half of the year, according to Apptica. Cook took to Chinese social media to celebrate the tournament, saying its \"energy was off the charts\" in a post on Weibo.\\n\\nCook\\'s surprise stop coincides with a tricky time for Apple in China, its biggest non-U.S. market and a major production hub. Demand for the iPhone 15, the company\\'s latest smartphone, is slowing, according to two recent analyst reports.\\n\\nChinese iPhone 15 sales during its first 17 days on the market underperformed when compared to the period following the launch of last year\\'s iPhone 14, according to preliminary data from Counterpoint Research shared with Fortune. The market research firm noted that sluggish sales in China differed sharply from robust demand in the U.S.\\n\\n“China’s headline numbers for the 15 series are in the red, and this is a reflection of the broader decline in consumer spending,” said Mengmeng Zhang, a research analyst at Counterpoint Research. Chinese consumers are scaling back their spending amid a stumbling economic recovery, dragged down by twin crises of real estate and youth unemployment.\\n\\nSeparately, Counterpoint Research also found that Huawei, which recently launched its high-end Mate 60 smartphone, was one of the few brands to report growth in the third quarter of this year. State media has celebrated Huawei\\'s latest phone as proof that the company and China can withstand U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nA report from Jefferies, also released Monday, is predicting a decline in Apple sales in China as well. Jefferies analysts forecast that weak demand in China could lead to lower-than-expected global shipments of the iPhone 15 this year, according to CNBC.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe iPhone is still Apple\\'s largest moneymaker, representing 52% of its sales last year. The China market contributed almost 20% of Apple\\'s revenue in 2022. Chinese factories also make about 85% of Apple\\'s iPhones, according to a December 2022 estimate from Counterpoint Research.\\n\\nApple\\'s regulatory challenges\\n\\nCook\\'s video gaming stop isn\\'t his first trip to China this year. The Apple head was one of the first U.S. CEOs to travel to the country following Beijing\\'s relaxing of COVID controls, including inbound quarantine for international arrivals. Cook attended a high-profile development conference, and celebrated the \"symbiotic kind of relationship\" between Apple and China. The company also complies with Chinese rules on data security and censorship.\\n\\nYet new rules from Beijing are complicating that relationship. China reportedly ordered staff at several government agencies not to bring iPhones to work. (Beijing officials denied those reports, but highlighted unspecified security concerns with Apple\\'s smartphones.)\\n\\nThe iPhone maker is also grappling with new censorship rules that require any program sold on Chinese app stores, including Apple\\'s, to be licensed by the Chinese government. Currently, Chinese users can download and install apps for banned services like YouTube and WhatsApp, but must resort to a virtual private network if they want to use them. Apple is now asking new apps to show proof of Chinese government approval. Once the grace period for existing apps ends in March, Apple may be forced to remove thousands of foreign apps from its Chinese store.\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-cook-crashes-chinese-e-084402850.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.929, 'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.071}}, {'date': '2023-10-17T05:58:54+00:00', 'title': 'Apple’s Cook Cheers on Tencent Game Gala in Rare China Visit', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook showed up at a Tencent gaming tournament in China, endorsing one of the biggest earners on the app store as uncertainty persists about the US company’s top overseas market.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nIsrael Latest: Blinken Works on Gaza Aid as Biden Set to Visit Your Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas War Putin Arrives in China to Meet Xi on Rare International Trip Israel Latest: Army Says Hamas Officials Dead; Over 600,000 in Gaza Flee South Xi’s $1 Trillion ‘Project of the Century’ Gets a Reality Check\\n\\nThe chief executive officer waved and made brief remarks to shoppers and staff during a surprise visit to Apple’s Taikoo Li store in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, according to a brief video posted on the social media platform Weibo.

His feed was then flooded with complaints about the poor quality of the snapshot, as well as comparisons to pictures produced by the Mate 60 and other local devices.\\n\\nBeijing has pledged this year to support private and foreign businesses, though criticism remains about the opacity of regulations.

Indeed, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock can’t seem to catch a bid in 2023. This presents a terrific opportunity for enterprising investors.\\n\\nPayPal is a premier fintech business that’s not afraid to try new ventures in leading-edge tech fields, such as the blockchain. However, it seems that some retail investors aren’t on board with PayPal’s innovative spirit this year.\\n\\nBut then, winning investors, not amateurs, follow the smart money. If big-money financiers see something special about PayPal now, maybe it’s time to follow the whales and embark on a dip-buying expedition with PYPL stock.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nInstitutional Investors Love PYPL Stock\\n\\nI’ve been pounding the table about PayPal’s low valuation for a while. Currently, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.62x. That’s quite reasonable for a large-cap technology firm in 2023.\\n\\nUnlike the “Magnificent Seven” firms, PayPal isn’t a darling of the financial markets right now. However, in early October it was reported that institutions own a whopping 72% of PYPL stock shares.\\n\\nI dug deeper and discovered that current and/or recent institutional PayPal shareholders include financial whales like Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). This, by itself, isn’t a buy signal, but it’s certainly a good sign.\\n\\nThus, the smart money isn’t fazed by PayPal’s CEO transition or PYPL’s decline. I suspect that they’re buying what the amateurs are panic-selling at discount prices. After all, that’s what smart-money investors do.\\n\\nPayPal’s Stablecoin Venture and Team-up With Apple\\n\\nAdditionally, I imagine that big-money investors want exposure to the fintech trends of the future. PayPal is definitely a future-facing business that’s willing to be first in fields that are untested today but have exciting growth potential.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor instance, you may have heard about PayPal’s\\xa0new\\xa0stablecoin, known as PayPal USD or PYUSD. This is a cryptocurrency token that’s “stable” because it’s backed by the U.S. dollar as well as government bonds.\\n\\nAmateur traders might not be forward-looking enough to see the future growth of this stablecoin. Yet, PayPal USD is reportedly already available on popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase Global’s (NASDAQ:COIN), Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp and Crypto.com.\\n\\nFurthermore, PayPal now has a value-added tie-in with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Specifically, PayPal’s customers can “add their eligible PayPal and Venmo credit or debit cards to Apple Wallet“. It’s a win-win scenario as these customers can conveniently make payments with via an iPhone or Apple Watch.\\n\\nPYPL Stock Is Cheap and Poised for a Comeback\\n\\nSome retail stock traders might not be willing to wait for PayPal’s stablecoin to gain traction. Or, maybe they can’t envision legions of Apple iPhone and Watch users using PayPal/Venmo credit and debit cards.\\n\\nTheir lack of patience and vision can be your opportunity. Clearly, institutional investors are happy to hold PYPL stock while the amateurs are selling it. Therefore, I invite you to join the smart-money set and avoid the panicky crowds, and hold a few PayPal shares of your own.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Counterpoint Research Director Jeff Fieldhack joins Yahoo Finance to break down the report as well as challenges for Apple within China.\\n\\nWhen asked about reasons for the underperformance, Fieldhack replies: \"The [Apple] ecosystem is a little weaker in China, a lot of these applications are not allowed there.\" He lists nationalistic consumer trends from Chinese citizens, using Huawei smartphones as a competitive domestic option to Apple\\'s landmark iPhone.\\n\\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\n- I\\'m interested why you think Huawei might be taking a bite here. Do you think there\\'s this growing nationalism among Chinese consumers? I asked, Jeff, because I remember Apple bulls reacting to when Huawei came out with that new device. And some were saying-- you know, they kind of shrugged it off. They said, listen, once you\\'re in Apple\\'s ecosystem, you don\\'t leave. It\\'s sticky. What are some reasons you think Huawei could be having some success here?\\n\\nJEFF FIELDHACK: Yeah, first, the ecosystem is a little weaker in China. A lot of these applications are not allowed there. So that\\'s the first obvious reason. You know, there is certainly nationalism. You know, while we did have devices-- and even the 4G devices are selling a little bit better. And now that they have a 5G device, even if the specs and the chip and the node is not-- you know, it\\'s a year or two years behind Apple, it still is drawing in consumers.\\n\\nOur research and testing of the device, the device is solid. If you are not an avid gamer-- the camera technology is great on the device-- you might not notice, you know, some of the areas where the overall device\\'s hardware is behind Apple and, for example, Samsung.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n- And, Jeff, all of this said about demand for the phones in China, your data also showed that things in the US are actually going OK. Can you walk us through those numbers?\\n\\nJEFF FIELDHACK: Yeah, we are seeing-- yeah, to put it in perspective, the North America market is much larger than the China market. So we\\'re at about 23 million in the North America market and about 17 million in the China market. So this weakness could be offset by the North America market.\\n\\nTheir-- the carriers and their promotions are on par with last year. We are finding the median spend on both TV and online is actually larger. And there\\'s a lot of competition in the US market with the cable players getting into wireless. And that\\'s further pushing, you know, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon.\\n\\n- And, Jeff, I\\'m interested that-- so your report covers these 17 days. Do you think investors should-- you know, who are listening right now, should they try to extrapolate, OK, that\\'s 17 days, what it might mean for that all important December quarter, that holiday quarter for Apple?\\n\\nJEFF FIELDHACK: Yeah, certainly. There are always lots of moving parts in what supply is. And we\\'re really tracking, you know, a supply up or down versus last year. And we are seeing it slightly higher. The wait periods globally are a bit longer. So it\\'s all what can be delivered in those last three weeks, which is always the case. But our estimates are showing that, you know, the supply is in a slightly better situation this year than last year overall. But the wait times are a little longer.\\n\\n- Jeff Fieldhack, thank you so much for joining us today, Jeff.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apples-iphone-15-underperforms-china-205142261.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.989, 'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.083}}, {'date': '2023-10-16T19:14:24+00:00', 'title': 'Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks', 'content': \"In this piece, we will take a look at Jim Simons' stock portfolio and the top ten stock picks.

The first half of the year was a stunner as a robust U.S. economy and a wave of hype around artificial intelligence pushed battered and beaten down mega cap technology stocks to new highs. Yet, as the third quarter of 2023 ended, uncertainty was once again back on investors' minds since the broader market performance is after all based on economic health.\\n\\nThe latest bit of 'intrigue' in the financial world relates to the massive bond market. While the stock market is the most widely discussed market in the media, the fact is that the bond market is equally, if not more important. Bonds, for those out of the loop, are financial instruments that are issued to solicit debt. A bondholder is entitled to regular interest payments and a repayment of the principal when the loan's term is over. To facilitate liquidity, bond investors are allowed to trade these instruments with each other, and turmoil in this market also impacts the stock market.\\n\\nThe first week of October was the usual hide and seek between investors, economic data, and the market. After the Labor Department's jobs data for September showed that the labor market continued to add a blistering number of jobs, bets that the Federal Reserve will continue on its path of interest rate hikes grew. This naturally saw bonds that are issued at older rates drop in value, which caused their yields (the coupon payment divided by the bond's price) to spike up. However, while traditional securities generally see a sustained drop in demand when their value drops, bonds are an interesting creature. This is because if the yield becomes too high, then money actually starts flowing into the bond market since everyone loves a $100 bond that pays a $10 coupon for a 10% yield. Naturally, to flow into the bond market, money has to flow out of the stock market, and consequently, stocks drop in value.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAt this point, you might be wondering why is the bond market important in a piece about the hedge fund boss Jim Simons. Well, Mr. Simons is the pioneer of an approach to stock trading that is called quantitative analysis. This approach takes a mathematical look at the market, and it seeks to employ complex mathematical formulas to use crucial metrics of share performance such as the price and the volumes traded.\\xa0 These techniques are also applicable to the bond market, and one subset of quantitative trading is trend trading. According to a Reuters investigation, hedge funds that look at trends for their bond buying and selling decisions were particularly well off during the latest bond market selloff. The key to their success is to figure out the price direction and the hunt for the proverbial bottom and top to allow the prudent trend hedge fund to patch on to price movement and make money.\\n\\nThese strategies and the bond market turmoil enabled several trend hedge funds to either make a return or reverse their losses earlier this year when the bond market tanked in the aftermath of a mini banking crisis in America. For instance, AQR Capital Management's AQR Alternative Trends Strategy fund was up by 13.1% as of September end, while Virtus Investment Partners' Virtus AlphaSimplex Managed Futures Strategy fund recovered from -10% in March to -2.5% as of early October.\\n\\nSo its clear that quantitative and mathematical trading has a lot of merit when it comes to making financial decisions, and if it weren't, then Mr. Simons wouldn't be worth $30.7 billion as of October 2023.

Whinston, who was hired by the Justice Department to conduct an empirical analysis for the case, previously testified on Oct. 6. “When you see Google paying billions and billions and billions, there has to be a reason. That’s the first thing that, as an economist, slaps me in the face,” he said.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice, in a landmark case, argues that the more than $10 billion that Alphabet Inc. pays to companies including Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others to ensure it’s the default allows it to maintain a monopoly on search. Those agreements bar Google’s rivals – like Microsoft Corp.’s Bing and DuckDuckGo – from tapping into one-third to 50% of all searches that take place in the US, Whinston said.\\n\\nAnother 20% of searches in the US are made through Google’s Chrome browser, which people download themselves, he said. Google sets its own search engine as the default in Chrome.\\n\\nAbout 33% of all US searches will always go to the default, Whinston estimated, meaning that a rival search engine could only ever hope to garner about 17% of US search traffic.\\n\\nWhinston based his estimates on internal numbers from Google, Microsoft and other search engine operators that were provided to the Justice Department in the case.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhinston said he conducted calculations based on data that showed when users shifted their defaults. That included information on how people responded when Apple dropped Google Maps as its default service on iPhones in favor of its own app — estimates that Google itself has relied on for years, he said. It also involved information on desktop searches, where users can more easily switch browsers, comparing Macs – where Apple’s Safari is the default browser with Google as the search engine – versus Windows PCs where Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Edge are the default with Bing.\\n\\nWhinston also examined how users responded when Russia and the European Commission required Android mobile phone manufacturers to offer a choice of search engines in response to antitrust complaints. In the Russia case, Yandex NV gained more than 20% in market share after the choice screen was introduced, Whinston said, “a complete reversal of share” between Yandex and Google within three years.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again Ad-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: Regulators Introducing The Businessweek Show With Max Abelson The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Rural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-deals-lock-50-us-183243970.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'MSF.F', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSFT.MX', 'MSFT.US', 'MSFT34.SA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.899, 'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.066}}, {'date': '2023-10-16T16:35:10+00:00', 'title': \"Bitcoin's ETF Approval Rumor, Pfizer Slashes Annual Outlook, Activist Shareholder Shakes Up News Corp's Status Quo: Today's Top Stories\", 'content': 'Benzinga\\n\\nBitcoin Spiked On False ETF Approval Rumor\\n\\nBitcoin (BTC/USD), the ace cryptocurrency, spiked on unverified reports of the approval of an iShares Bitcoin ETF.

Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee reckoned sales of the iPhone 15 were down by an even sharper double-digit percentage from its predecessor after Huawei outsold Apple overall, powered by the surprising debut of the Mate 60 Pro.\\n\\nThe twin reports mark a potential blow to Apple at a time it’s grappling with the weakest smartphone demand in a decade and a backlash from overheating models. If the initial estimates are accurate, they represent one of the iPhone’s worst debuts in China since around 2018, when local names like Oppo and Vivo began to captivate Asian consumers.\\n\\nCounterpoint blamed the iPhone’s slump in China mainly on an economy struggling to rebound from its Covid trough. And it stressed that in the US, the iPhone 15 likely posted a double-digit rise over 2022 in the first nine days of sales.\\n\\nBut the iPhone’s debut in China came weeks after the launch of the Mate 60 Pro, celebrated as a triumph over US sanctions because of its advanced made-in-China processor. It also coincided with a government mandate to expand a ban on iPhone use to government agencies and state companies, underscoring Apple’s growing challenges there.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“The US is hot right now with back-to-back stellar weekends for the new iPhone,” said Counterpoint research director Jeff Fieldhack. “It’s a positive sign from the biggest iPhone market in the world. So definitely takes some of the sting off the China numbers.”\\n\\nApple shares fell 0.8% at 10:04 a.m. in New York.\\n\\nAnalysts remain divided about the longer-term impact in China, the world’s largest smartphone arena. Many analysts argue Huawei’s rising prominence could erode Apple’s dominance of the higher end of the market.\\n\\nCounterpoint estimates the Chinese company could sell 5 to 6 million units of the Mate 60 Pro alone this year. Analysts estimate that could rise to double-digits in 2024. Huawei has now taken the top spot in the market from Apple, Jefferies wrote in a note on Monday.\\n\\n“The trend suggests iPhone would lose to Huawei in 2024,” Lee and colleagues wrote. “We believe weak demand in China would eventually lead to lower-than-expected global shipments of iPhone.”\\n\\nRead More: What Huawei’s Comeback Says About US-China Tech War\\n\\n(Updates with shares in seventh paragraph)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Pro-Putin Propaganda Flows Onto Android via Google Loophole Business Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded Programs Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?\\n\\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphones-off-disappointing-start-102104686.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': -0.97, 'neg': 0.102, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.069}}, {'date': '2023-10-16T13:32:51+00:00', 'title': 'Better Stock Buy: Coherent vs. Lumentum', 'content': \"Coherent (NYSE: COHR) and Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE) are two of the world's largest producers of lasers and optical communications chips.

The country manufactured 679 million smartphones from January to August this year, down 7.5 per cent from the same period in 2022, according to data published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology earlier this month.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut the \"golden week\" indicator, referenced by TF analyst Kuo, for domestic smartphone demand shows that a welcome change in consumer sentiment appears on hand in spite of the country\\'s bumpy post-pandemic economy recovery, which has been weighed down by a property crisis, record high youth unemployment and weak confidence in the private sector.\\n\\nThe market\\'s outlook for the rest of 2023 could improve on the back of the new 5G smartphones released by Huawei and Apple, as well as the coming winter sales season, according to an October 6 Post report that cited Counterpoint senior research analyst Ivan Lam.\\n\\nIn another sign of a rebound, China\\'s smartphone export volume rose to 83.5 million units in September, up almost 30 per cent from 64.6 million in August, according to official government data released on Friday.\\n\\nStill, the total smartphone export volume in the January to September period remained down 8.5 per cent year on year to 561.4 million units, according to official data.\\n\\nShenzhen-based Huawei\\'s low-key launch on the mainland of its Mate 60 Pro and Mate 60 Pro+ handsets, powered by an advanced mystery chip, marked the US-blacklisted company\\'s return to the 5G smartphone market, which has ignited patriotic fervour and strong local demand after years of struggle under Washington\\'s tech and trade sanctions.\\n\\nHuawei has already raised its smartphone shipment target by 20 per cent for the second half of the year, buoyed by the popularity of its Mate 60 Pro series, according to a report by Beijing-based business newspaper Securities Daily.\\n\\nApple\\'s new iPhone 15 series, meanwhile, has also drawn long queues of shoppers at the company\\'s bricks-and-mortar stores in China.

Rate hikes prompted by rampant inflation caused a swift and about-face for a sector that had been red hot. The hype fell off a cliff, the reality of Fed rate hikes set in, and investor capital fled the sector en masse. Still, there’s still plenty of potential left in VR stocks for investors to consider.\\n\\nIf you’re thinking it should have been predictable, it wasn’t. Headlines celebrated the sector before it fell and an infamous rebrand only reinforced the idea that the metaverse was set to continue growing. Rate hikes are slowing now and there’s an end in sight. VR/AR/XR products are going to be released in the near future.\\n\\nThat means investors are again reexamining VR stocks and so should you.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nApple (AAPL)\\n\\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has performed very well in 2023. It hasn’t been due to VR in any direct way. Nor has it been due to growth. In fact, Apple continued to contract in its fiscal year Q3 overall.\\n\\niPhone sales are down which is a leading indicator that consumers simply don’t have as much money for expensive tech as they did in the recent past. That should dictate that AAPL shares fall in price. They haven’t. Apple is simply too big and important and has too many catalysts in its favor. Investors are giving Apple credit for all of it. That includes a burgeoning market in India where Apple is investing heavily. It also includes an increasing ability to derive more revenue from services. This makes it one of those VR stocks to consider.\\n\\nEven when Apple falters investors give it the benefit of the doubt. iPhone sales have inspired a cult-like following and that matters. VR matters too. Apple will release the Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024. It will cost $3,499. While that’s a lofty price, it isn’t expected to move the revenue needle much given sales projections. Instead, it gives Apple greater long-term potential in an exciting new sector.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMeta Platforms (META)\\n\\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI alluded to Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) rebrand in the introduction to this article. The stock gave a lot of pundits a lot to like when it ditched its Facebook moniker in late October of 2021.\\n\\nThe rebrand implied that growth initiatives were here to stay. Otherwise, what would give Facebook the confidence to abandon its brand for the Metaverse? You don’t give up the Facebook name without a firm belief that rates will remain low and growth high. The Meta Platforms rebrand was a screaming indication of that belief. It was also wrong. A few weeks later inflation data caught up to the markets. The realization that quantitative tightening was approaching swept over markets in mid-November. The newly renamed Meta Platforms tanked, Zuckerberg looked like a fool, and the metaverse fervor dissipated.\\n\\nAll things come and go. Meta Platforms has rebounded in 2023. The rebound is primarily attributable to its growing top-line and steady bottom-line performance. Reality Labs, its virtual reality segment, is only losing more and more money. It has sold a lot of headsets but struggles to retain customers. As VR comes back into focus that’s where Meta can make gains.\\n\\nQualcomm (QCOM)\\n\\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLet me start by discussing Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a stock that is attractive in general. The company is an important chipmaker in the tech space and has forged important relationships with the world’s biggest companies. Apple among them. It’s going to continue to supply Apple with RF chips through 2026. That’s a big win because it provides a stable runway for the firm for several years.\\n\\nFurther, Qualcomm is simply stable overall. Not many other tech firms of its size provide a dividend that yields 2.9%. QCOM shares do and that dividend has grown since 2003. Investors should get the general sense that Qualcomm is stable. This stability may boost its attractiveness as one of those VR stocks.\\n\\nIn regard to virtual reality, Qualcomm is also notable. The company is developing VR glasses that will compete with the Apple Vision Pro in the near future. They’re not nearly as large and look like industrial safety glasses, not a massive headset. Overall, QCOM is a safe bet for tech exposure that includes virtual reality.\\n\\nUnity Software (U)\\n\\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nA peak into Unity Software’s (NYSE:U) investor relations provides a lot of insight into the direction of the stock. It is heavily entrenched in the reemerging virtual reality opportunity.\\n\\nThe company released a beta program to allow developers to begin creating apps and games for the Apple Vision Pro in July. Unity developers are now creating VR experiences using VisionOS, Apple’s operating system for its headset.\\n\\nUnity has also set up a new division that will grant the broader virtual effects industry access to its Weta FX tools. Those tools were used in movies including Lord of the Rings and Avatar. The new division is making both 2D and 3D tools available to developers. That further confirms that Unity Software has established itself in the VR space.\\n\\nUnity Software continues to grow steadily and reached EBITDA profitability in Q4 of 2022. Net losses narrowed in H1 though still substantial. Those losses are likely to be a drag on U shares in this higher longer rate environment. That said, the overall picture is positive based on VR-related news and fundamental improvements.\\n\\nMatterport (MTTR)\\n\\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) stock is again becoming a relevant growth story in the virtual reality/digital twin space. The company sells 3D cameras and software that are used to create virtual models of buildings. It’s easy to imagine the overall utility and opportunity the company provides for investors as more and more spaces get mapped digitally.\\n\\nThat is actually precisely what’s occurring at the moment. Matterport is growing steadily and rapidly. Q2 revenues grew by 39% to $39.6 million. That’s great but not particularly compelling to investors because of the rates. The issue that holds MTTR stock lower at the moment is the fact that losses increased from $56.5 million to $64.6 million in Q2. The positive there is that losses grew at a lower rate than that by which revenues increased. In other words, Matterport could reasonably be expected to see losses begin to narrow in the future.\\n\\nIt has no problem selling its cameras and software. It has a cyclicality problem that will change in a year or so. It’s definitely one o those VR stocks to consider.\\n\\nAdobe (ADBE)\\n\\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\\n\\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another stock that’s heavily invested in virtual reality. It’s perhaps best known for tools like Acrobat but it is also a major visualization firm as evidenced by Photoshop’s dominance. Adobe’s presence in 2D digital visualization should make it unsurprising that the company is moving into 3D digital experiences as well.\\n\\nAbode Substance 3D is the company’s toolset for 3D and AR software. It supports 3D modeling of objects just as all other 3D visualization software does. It’s difficult to assert that Adobe is the clear winner in that regard as it remains early. However, it’s incontrovertible that Adobe just delivered record revenue in Q3. It also reported record digital media annual recurring revenue for within digital media. Adobe is capitalizing on the AI boom and the VR opportunity is yet to come.\\n\\nABDE shares are strong even though the company is part of a second tier of tech stocks that fall behind the likes of the ‘Magnificent 7’.\\n\\nNvidia (NVDA)\\n\\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), unsurprisingly, is also very useful for virtual reality. That, among many other strengths, continues to make the stock a strong overall pick.\\n\\nThere’s no definitive ‘best’ chip for VR. Everything depends upon end-use and budget. This guide lays out those options very thoroughly. Nvidia comes up again and again and that’s yet another reason that investors have to believe in its long-term value.\\n\\nIt’s tough to talk about Nvidia without mentioning AI. Its dominance in that sphere has propelled shares massively higher this year as generative AI has been commercialized. AI investment has cooled as the market is more fearful at the moment. However, Nvidia has done its part: It delivered revenues that far exceeded already sky-high estimates in Q2. Buy it for virtual reality because it’s strong there or buy it for AI because it dominates there. Nvidia simply remains a buy because it’s too difficult to argue against its overall strengths in this new era as AI emerges. Whichever way you cut it, this means it one of those VR stocks to pay attention to.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Given their big weighting, “you can bet that the rest of the market will play follow the leader as big tech earnings unfold this quarter.”\\n\\nHe said he sees “fairly low odds of a tech earnings wreck this quarter.”\\n\\nInvestors have good reason to be optimistic. In the past century, the S&P 500 has rallied during reporting season about two-thirds of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\\n\\nRoadblocks Ahead\\n\\nOne potential roadblock to an earnings-fueled rally is that a lot of the anticipated good news may be priced in. Alphabet and Amazon have gained more than 50% this year, while Apple and Microsoft have advanced nearly 40%.\\n\\nOn top of rising profit expectations, the stocks have benefited from bets that the tech giants are best positioned to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. That’s despite Nvidia, whose shares have tripled this year, being the only one to show a substantial financial boost from the trend.\\n\\nA source of concern for investors is that even with recent declines, big tech’s stock-market valuations are still elevated. Apple and Microsoft are priced at about 27 and 29 times estimated earnings, respectively, well above averages over the past decade. That figure is around 18 for the S&P 500 as a whole.\\n\\nExpensive share prices put pressure on companies to deliver strong earnings, according to Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\\n\\n“They have to constantly deliver or they will lose the attention of investors,” she said in an interview. “Somebody needs to keep buying, and these rich valuations need to be justified.”\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal Again The K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTS Has Bob Iger Lost the Magic?

All bets are off whether stocks can end the year on a high note.\\n\\nIssues like inflation, interest rates, and the risk of a recession continue to drive volatility among stocks. While that’s not to say you need to head for the hills completely, now may be the time to remove positions in stocks most vulnerable to further price declines.\\n\\nWith speculative growth stocks that have performed poorly this year, accept your losses and move on. As the economic environment is likely to stay challenging in the months ahead, holding on for even a partial rebound may not be worth it.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThese types of stocks could especially plunge in December, when tax loss harvesting is in full swing.\\n\\nAs for names that have performed well during 2023, you may still want to make an exit. Take the money and run, as this year’s gains, driven in large part by investors betting too soon on macro uncertainties swiftly clearing up, could prove fleeting.\\n\\nThese seven stocks listed below fit into either category.\\n\\nAirbnb (ABNB)\\n\\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nWhile pulling back in more recent months, shares in lodging marketplace operator Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) are up by more than 48% year-to-date.\\n\\nYet while the travel economy has proven resilient, if you bought in when concerns that the “travel boom” was turning into a “travel bust” peaked, in December 2022, consider now the time to book the win and cash out.\\n\\nBesides the potential impact of a 2024 recession, there are other concerns with ABNB stock. New York City’s crackdown on short-term rentals could pave the way for similarly stringent regulations in other major cities.\\n\\nTo some, ABNB’s valuation (32.8 times forward earnings) may not seem too excessive.\\n\\nStill, as analysts at KeyBanc recently argued, the company’s growth is slowing down, and future results may fall short of expectations. As company insiders continue to reduce their personal positions in Airbnb, if you own it, consider following suit.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCarvana (CVNA)\\n\\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLast month, I argued that Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) was one of the top stocks to sell. Mostly, because the valuation of this online used car retailer does not line up well with its underlying fundamentals.\\n\\nI’m, of course, not the only one who is skeptical about the bull case on CVNA stock.\\n\\nAs InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto recently pointed out, an unfavorable environment for used car sales calls into question Carvana’s ability to report improved results in the coming quarters. That’s not all. According to Fintel, short interest in CVNA has fallen, from 64% of float in May, to around 44% of float today.\\n\\nWhile that may suggest short-sellers are becoming less bearish about this stock, falling short interest also means decreasing chances for future short squeezes, and a diminishing of CVNA’s appeal as a short-squeeze play. Waning squeeze appeal also points to lower prices ahead for shares.\\n\\nGameStop (GME)\\n\\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nGameStop’s (NYSE:GME) former “meme king” status keeps fading, as seen with the stock’s hitting of new multi-year lows in recent weeks.\\n\\nAt one point, “long and strong” fans of the video-game retailer’s shares may have believed that improved fundamentals could help sustain GME’s valuation.\\n\\nHowever, few fans are that optimistic about GME stock anymore. Sell-side analysts like Wedbush’s Michael Pachter and Nick McKay have an even more dire forecast for shares.\\n\\nIn a Sept. 28 research note, the two analysts said that the recent appointment of GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen as CEO “ensures GameStop’s demise.”\\n\\nWhy? Between Cohen’s inexperience running a physical retailer, and GameStop’s failure to penetrate the e-commerce market, the company is en route to its “game over moment,” as digital downloads fully replace physical game sales.\\n\\nWhile it may not plunge to zero tomorrow, sell GME now. Shares will likely stay on a downward trajectory.\\n\\nLucid Group (LCID)\\n\\nSource: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nI’ve long argued that Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of the top stocks to sell. My bearish view remains unchanged, even as shares in the electric vehicle startup are about to fall into “penny stock territory” (under $5 per share).\\n\\nLCID stock may be far cheaper today compared to twelve months ago, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bargain.\\n\\nDelivering just 4,267 vehicles YTD and struggling to build a fanbase, Lucid’s $11.6 billion market cap belies the fact it has more in common with “EV also-rans” than it does Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\\n\\nLucid keeps charging ahead, opening its first overseas auto plant in Saudi Arabia, yet a lack of success stateside makes success in international markets questionable.\\n\\nBarring a “lift off” in the brand’s popularity, expect underwhelming results, plus the company’s dependence on dilutive capital raises, to keep pushing shares lower.\\n\\nModerna (MRNA)\\n\\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nInvestors who bought into Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) ahead of the 2021 Covid-19 vaccination wave profited in a big way. Those who entered positions in this biotech stock after peak of this trend have fared far worse, if they held their shares until now.\\n\\nWith only a fraction of the public getting the latest booster shots from this company and from competing vaccine makers, it’s no surprise that Moderna’s sales have fallen off a cliff, with multi-billion dollar profits giving way to heavy losses this year, next year, and the year after that.\\n\\nAlthough the pandemic-era high-flier is spending heavily to develop other mRNA-based vaccines and therapies, insider selling by members of Moderna’s board and C-suite suggests a lack of confidence.\\n\\nIf you continue to hold MRNA stock, sell.\\n\\nPeloton Interactive (PTON)\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) today trades at price levels far below the triple-digit levels shares went for three years. Once-hot, now out-of-favor “stay at home economy” play remains one of the top stocks to sell.\\n\\nSure, in recent quarters, things have stabilized for the connected fitness company, and for PTON stock.\\n\\nPeloton even just recently entered a partnership with athletic apparel retailer Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU). Yet while things may not be getting worse, to say the situation is improving may be a stretch.\\n\\nSell-side forecasts still call for Peloton to keep reporting negative earnings over the next three fiscal years. Although the Lululemon deal may sound like something that will enable PTON to exceed expectations, sell-side analysts are not convinced.\\n\\nWhile downside risk may be minimal from here, as the same holds true for upside potential, sell/stay away.\\n\\nQualcomm (QCOM)\\n\\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAt first, you might question my view that it’s time to sell Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has performed poorly compared to other chip stocks.\\n\\nDespite steady declines since 2022, it seems now headwinds/uncertainties are fully priced-in, right?\\n\\nNot necessarily. Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) extended its agreement to buy 5G modem chips from this semiconductor company for another three years, continued weak demand industry-wide for mobile device chips could outweigh this positive surprise.\\n\\nBesides the fact Apple still plans to ultimately bring chip production in-house, Qualcomm is also dealing with the loss of China’s Huawei as a major customer.\\n\\nWhile a restructuring plan, plus a move into high-growth areas like AI and the metaverse may minimize the impact of these issues, the market is likely waiting until Qualcomm’s core business bounces back before diving into shares.\\n\\nWith this, there’s little reason to be long QCOM stock right now.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The online business review site has been one of Google\\'s harshest critics while spending more than a decade railing against a strategy that favors its own services in search results.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s search engine earned its huge market share by almost instantaneously presenting people with helpful information culled from the billions of websites that have been indexed since former Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the technology during the late 1990s.\\n\\nIn addition to its technological wizardry, Google also pays billions of dollars each year to ensure its search engine is the default choice for answering queries entered in the world\\'s most popular smartphones and web browsers.\\n\\nThese agreements don’t preclude users from switching to a different search engine in their settings, but it’s a tedious process that few people bother to navigate. This reality is why Google is willing to pay so much for the privileged position, according to the Justice Department.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nGoogle\\'s payments for preeminent search placement — including an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion per year to Apple alone — are at the head of the Justice Department\\'s case, making it probable the judge would prohibit them if he rules against Google.\\n\\nShould that happen, experts believe the most likely remedy in the U.S. would be a requirement for smartphones and web browsers to display a palette of different search engines during the setup process. That\\'s something already being done in Europe, where all indications, so far, are that most people are still opting for Google.\\n\\nThat could be because they believe Google truly is the best search engine — as Google argues in their defense — or they just trust the brand more than rival options such as Microsoft\\'s Bing or the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo.\\n\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella asserted Google has an almost hypnotic hold on users while testifying earlier this month during the trial.\\n\\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella said. He then added that the only way to break the habit is by changing the default choice.\\n\\nAs long as a ruling doesn\\'t exclude Google\\'s rivals from paying to be the automatic search engine on smartphones and web browsers, Microsoft could buy the default position for Bing — an opportunity Nadella indicated he would seize.\\n\\n“There’s defaults — the only thing that matter in terms of changing search behavior,” Nadella testified.\\n\\nFlorian Schaub, associate professor of information at the University of Michigan, believes the fairest outcome in the trial would an across-the-board ban on all default agreements between two companies.\\n\\n“The current environment is being shaped by an architecture that\\'s designed by the big companies that control the space,” Schaub said. “What the government can do is inject some neutralism into this and give consumers some actual choices. If people still choose to use Google, that is at least a consumer choice, which would better than having people stick to a default because they are conditioned to that default.”\\n\\nIn his testimony during the trial, Apple executive Eddy Cue said the company has embraced Google as the preferred search engine on the iPhone and other products because it provides the best experience for its customers. That stance has raised speculation that if Apple is blocked from using Google as the default search engine on the iPhone, it might flex its muscle as the world\\'s richest company to develop its own search technology.\\n\\nHowever, a blanket ban on default search agreements that have been highly profitable for Apple and other companies such as wireless provider Verizon could trigger unintended consequences, such as raising prices on other popular products.\\n\\n\"If Google is no longer paying big bucks to Apple and other companies, they might raise the prices for their devices,\" said David Olson, an associate professor for the Boston College Law School who is following the antitrust trial. “I don\\'t think they will be big, but we could see some price increases because Google has essentially been subsidizing the cost of devices like the iPhone.”\\n\\nAnother offshoot of a ban on default search agreements is that Google still could have a dominant advantage in search if people continue to proactively choose it and the company would have billions of dollars more to spend in other areas that it once devoted to deals that it really didn\\'t need at all.\\n\\n“Google must think they getting a great benefit from those default agreements, but maybe they\\'re really not worth that much,” Olson said. “Maybe their cost/benefit analysis is off and they will wind up more money and just as much dominance. That would be ironic.”\\n\\nAlthough the trial is focused on Google\\'s search engine, a government victory could have more sweeping consequences across the technology industry if Mehta decided all default settings are anti-competitive and outlaws all defaults in the settings.\\n\\n“If one of the outcomes of the trial is that there needs to be more neutral choices, it wouldn\\'t just affect Google on Android phones, it could also affect Apple and the iPhone,” Schaub said. “Does it mean Google phones might have to offer (Apple\\'s virtual assistant) Siri as an alternative to the Google Assistant? Or would Apple devices have to offer Google Assistant?”\\n\\nA decision like that would open a crack in the digital wall that Apple has built around the iPhone to give its own software and certain pet products such as Siri exclusive access to the device\\'s more than 1 billion users, setting the stage for another potential legal battle.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-antitrust-trial-means-search-131351878.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.997, 'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.107}}, {'date': '2023-10-15T12:01:09+00:00', 'title': 'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 55% of the company', 'content': \"Key Insights\\n\\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Apple implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 25 shareholders own 40% of the company Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\\n\\nIf you want to know who really controls Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 55% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\\n\\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\\n\\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Apple.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple  ownership-breakdown\\n\\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\\n\\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\\n\\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Apple. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Apple, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\\n\\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Apple is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.6% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\\n\\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\\n\\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\\n\\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\\n\\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\\n\\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Apple Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.8b of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\\n\\nGeneral Public Ownership\\n\\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Apple. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\\n\\nPublic Company Ownership\\n\\nWe can see that public companies hold 5.9% of the Apple shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.\\n\\nNext Steps:\\n\\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for Apple that you should be aware of.\\n\\nUltimately the future is most important.

Following the country tightening its app regulation last year, Apple has recently begun asking app developers targeting mainland users to show proof of licensing from local internet regulators, in the US giant\\'s latest move to comply with censorship laws in one of its most lucrative markets.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nExperts predict that Apple will soon start retroactively removing apps unlikely to be licensed, such as Instagram, Google and X. While some of these platforms are also reachable through web browsers using a VPN, Alex said the policy change would complicate his usage of the foreign-based platforms.\\n\\nMeanwhile, many other services - such as WhatsApp, which has been steadily gaining traction in China - can only be accessed through an app.\\n\\nA key change to Apple\\'s policy is the need for apps to receive an Internet Information Provider (ICP) licence from Chinese regulators, which effectively requires all apps to use a mainland domain and be hosted by a local entity, according to Chinese app developers familiar with the process.\\n\\n\"It\\'s already having a big impact on the space,\" said Samuel Jesse, founder and digital director of Digital Creative Asia, a Shanghai-based digital product and user experience agency.\\n\\nThe rule affects not just censored foreign apps, but also apps that target Chinese users, but do not have local operations, said Jesse, adding that small, independent developers are likely to face the most difficulties.\\n\\nHe said that Digital Creative Asia has been advising foreign clients who wish to remain on Apple\\'s app store on how they can host their apps in China, or create a Chinese-focused version of their app that is separate from the global version.\\n\\nThe second option has not always worked out.\\n\\nProfessional networking platform LinkedIn created a Chinese compliant version of its app with strict content filters in 2021, but it gave up on the effort earlier this year.\\n\\nThe LinkedIn headquarters in Mountain View, California.

Still, the CAC in late September released a list of registered app stores, with the Californian company notably absent. Officials said that failure to register between September to March would result in punishment.\\n\\nSoon after, Apple began mandating ICP licences from app developers.\\n\\nAnother side effect of the CAC\\'s requirements is that they could shrink the number of apps available in China - seen by some as an indicator of the health of a country\\'s digital economy.\\n\\nChina\\'s Apple App Store currently has the largest amount of app offerings out of all platforms in the country, with about 21 per cent of its 5,000 most downloaded apps published by foreign developers, according to data from Sensor Tower.\\n\\nThat data does not account for people who downloaded apps through iOS stores set to other regions, or from third-party platforms.\\n\\nKareem Abdelkader, an Egyptian working in Shanghai, said he was able to continue to access and update banned apps such as Instagram from China by keeping his Apple ID regional settings in Egypt.\\n\\nIn general, users who want to change their App Store regional settings are required to provide a payment method accepted by the region they are switching to, which can complicate the process.\\n\\nHowever, Tanya, a 28-year-old social media manager in Shanghai who only gave the Post her first name, said she was able to purchase a US Apple ID online, and used it to download a VPN and access Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp. Having to constantly switch between accounts was annoying though, she added.\\n\\n\"There will definitely remain loopholes that citizens [in China], especially the more tech savvy of them, will find to use these apps,\" Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, said.\\n\\n\"Still, I do expect a drop-off in this usage, with the tightened policy presenting a more significant barrier to entry, with users less likely to find the apps in the first place,\" he added.\\n\\n- Additional reporting by Yuke Xie and Meredith Chen\\n\\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

For example, Amazon and\\xa0Netflix, Inc.

Just last year this $50B was expected to be $15B-$17B, signifying the massive inflection at hand. We believe this step function in demand almost entirely accrues to Nvidia, one of our winners in Q1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) currently does not have an AI-specific accelerated card but should be in the market by the end of the year, making it also compelling. Regardless, Nvidia’s software is the only game in town, and we believe it will ultimately be layered on top of AMD or any other cards that come up. We are early in this process and believe we have sized this market more accurately than other research providers, giving us an advantage in executing and generating alpha in this area over the coming years. Downstream,\\xa0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is also an important holding for us and one of only three companies that is currently able to manufacture these accelerated cards at scale.

For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models.

Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward.

Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.\\n\\nFor the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions.

We already know who you are. We know your identity. We know your payments. Tony West, the General Counsel, was saying last week, he was in the U.K., and he booked the Eurostar ticket beautifully effortlessly on the app. And frankly, early on in our experimentation with travel and the tour operator market, we’re a little worried that with these additional products on the app distract the user from the mainline use case from I’m going to get from point A to B, I want to go to [indiscernible], et cetera, just get me there.\\n\\nAnd what we’re seeing more recently is that with the power of machine learning, we can offer the right product to the consumer at the right time.

We’ve now expanded into flights as well. And we’re actually seeing engagement with users being higher than we thought, and we’re not seeing cannibalization of the base business.

Delivery gross bookings, also $15 billion, were up 12% from last year and accelerated through the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million, up $593 million year over year, significantly beat management’s $660-$700 million guidance and the company generated $549 million of free cash flow versus a loss last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 2Q Gross Bookings (13%-17% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $800- $850 million).\\n\\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.4 billion in Freight revenue for 1Q23), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $84 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”\\n\\n6.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks With Huge Catalysts on the Way.\\n\\nThe US stock market continues to be in a see-saw mode as investors gauge and digest latest data. The latest jobs report shows that the labor market continues to be strong, adding to the possibility of further rate hikes. In a September market update report, JPMorgan had said that the next few reports might show that inflation pressures are returning and that would be the test of investors’ nerves. Amid strong consumer spending and tight labor market, analysts believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and the central bank is more than ready to continue raising interest rates. Major stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and\\xa0 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are moving based on these events.\\n\\nWhile the debate around the possibility of further rate hikes and stickiness of inflation is never ending, one thing is for sure: long-term investors take any sell-off in the current environment as a buying opportunity. Jim Cramer last month said that it does not make any sense to sell stocks just because the Federal Reserve is not providing enough clarity around its future plans. These are uncertain times and asking for total certainty and clarity is unrealistic. Cramer said that investors should buy stocks that do well during inflation and sell them once inflation begins to cool down. Cramer said that rising interest rates was one of the reasons why investors were selling stocks. However, he believes real investing means you buy stocks for long-term gains instead of relying on short-term news cycles. Cramer said:\\n\\n“The Fed can’t upend the rally because there isn’t a rally. Higher rates won’t send stocks lower because they’re already down. That’s how you have to think about things like the stock market. Otherwise, you know what? There really isn’t a level where it feels safe to own stocks other than at the top, when nobody’s worried about anything. That’s not investing, though. That’s called stupidity.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhile most of the analysts talk about the possibility of rate cuts and cooling inflation in 2024, there’s another angle to this story that has started to become a topic of discussion lately. Some analysts are starting to believe that we are entering a new era where interest rates and inflation are expected to stay at elevated levels for several years to come. There’s no way around it, according to them. In March 2023, T. Rowe Price said in a report that the biggest reason why value made a huge comeback against growth in 2022 was the reality check investors had after a long period of time. When credit was cheap and inflation low, technology companies enjoyed huge gains. But the post-pandemic era and its realities started to give rise to inflation and the world of today is starkly different from the past. The report said that inflation and interest rates could stay at elevated levels for a long time, which could bode well for value stocks as investors flock to realistic valuations.\\n\\nThe T. Rowe Price report also said that in the next decade many dominant companies of today could be on a decline amid competition. The report said that several years from now people would still be using digital services and driving electric cars but there would be a lot of new players in digital services and companies dominating the futuristic technology markets today might not be very exciting investments 10 years from now. The report gives example of Volkswagen, which it believes is cheap when it comes to valuation. What if Volkswagen begins to produce EVs of standard at par with Tesla in the future? Given Volkswagen\\'s huge size and dominance in traditional car markets, the stock could become more attractive than Tesla in the future because big size gives advantage to survive and thrive when competition is high.\\n\\nBut not everyone is optimistic in the short term. JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic believes chances of markets avoiding a recession are thin. Talking to CNBC, the analyst said that in the short term stocks could still have upside but a few months from now the S&P 500 has downside.\\n\\n“Could there be another five, six, seven percent upside in equities? Of course... But there’s a downside. It could be 20% downside,” Kolanovic said.\\n\\nThe analyst warned that the “magnificent seven” companies that have seen huge gains during 2023 are expected to see declines soon. These companies include tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. Most of the stock market gains this year came from these mega-cap tech stocks. Several analysts have been consistently warning about the concentration of stock market gains problem. Most of the gains in the stock market this year came due to the AI boom which had investors jumping on the bandwagon of AI. But Kolanovic believes these companies could soon start to see declines. He’s also worried about the state of the consumer in the US, who is increasingly getting crushed by inflation and rate hikes.\\n\\n“The job market is still strong. But you are starting to see the stress in [the] consumer if you look at sort of the delinquencies in the [credit] cards and auto loans. We remain somewhat negative still,” Kolanovic said. Stocks With Huge Catalysts on the Way\\n\\nsource: pixabay\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nFor this article, we scoured several analyst reports and investing platforms to list down stocks that are expected to move on upcoming catalysts, events, and news.

Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF)\\n\\nGolf products company Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks with catalysts on the way. The overall popularity of golf as a sport is the biggest growth catalyst for Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF). Recently, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth said the company is expected to benefit from new product launches and biannual new golf ball design introductions. The analyst said Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF)’s strong brand is a growth catalyst, as its Titleist brand golf balls remain the preferred choice of PGA and LPGA Tour players. He increased Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF)’s price target to $68 from $62.\\n\\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of funds had stakes in Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF).\\n\\n9. Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM)\\n\\nAmbrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM) – ADR ranks 9th in our list of stocks with upcoming growth catalysts. Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM) has already gained a whopping 950% over the past one year.\\xa0 Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM) is a clinical-stage biotech company making engineered precision biologics using synthetic amino acids to enhance therapeutic functions. Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM)’s treatment ARX788 for cancer therapeutics is promising and could become a strong growth catalyst in the future. Initial ARX788 trial data showed promise for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\\n\\n8. Inozyme Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:INZY)\\n\\nInozyme Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:INZY) is a clinical stage biotech company working on treatments of rare diseases affecting vasculature, soft tissue, and skeleton.\\xa0 Short-term potential growth catalyst for Inozyme Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:INZY) was the results for a recent Phase 1/2 trial for I be INZ-701.

(NYSE:CMG)\\n\\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shares have gained about 30% year to date but Baird analyst David Tarantino believes the stock has more growth catalysts coming on the back of expected increase in same store sales near the year end. The analyst noted that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) saw some weakness amid low traffic at restaurants in the second and third quarter. He sees Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) increasing its unit growth to the high end of its target of 8% to 10% annually.\\n\\n\"Specifically, we expect signs of strong same-store traffic momentum and further pricing actions to lead to an upward bias to EPS estimates and support robust valuation metrics on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) heading into year-end,” the analyst said in a note.\\n\\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) also saw a jump in hedge fund sentiment during the second quarter. As of the end of the period, 55 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), up from 47 hedge funds in the previous quarter.\\n\\nPershing Square Holdings made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)’s business strength continued in 2023, driven by the company’s focus on exceptional food and operational excellence. During the second quarter, Chipotle grew same-store sales by 7.4%, or 40% from 2019 levels. Transactions grew 4.4%, a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter, and price increases from 2022 contributed 5.5% offset somewhat by a shift from group to individual orders which was a 2.5% headwind. The negative group to individual impact should shrink in the balance of the year and cease to be a headwind as we enter 2024.\\n\\nChipotle’s ongoing traffic momentum is fueled by improving in-restaurant execution and its continued cadence of successful menu innovation. The current limited time offering, chicken al pastor, is ordered in one out of every five transactions. Management plans to launch a new limited time offering later in the third quarter. Unlike most competitors, Chipotle has not yet taken pricing in 2023, thereby further improving its industry-leading value proposition. Management did, however, signal its openness to increasing menu prices later this year if cost inflation persists…” (Click here to read the full text)\\n\\n6. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)\\n\\nRaymond James analyst Andrew Marok recently upgraded Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO) to Outperform from Market Perform and maintained a price target of $170.
